Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The main issue with the code lies in the way it reads input and processes it. The problem description specifies that the input is a single line containing four integers separated by spaces. However, the function `func_1` is used to read these integers, and it does not handle the case where the input is not properly formatted.

### Issues:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` uses `raw_input()` to read input and splits it using a delimiter. However, the delimiter is not specified, and the function assumes a single space as the default delimiter. If the input is not provided in the exact format (four integers separated by a single space), the program will fail to parse the input correctly.

2. **Floating Point Precision**: The problem description requires the output to have an absolute or relative error not exceeding \(10^{-6}\). The code uses floating-point arithmetic, which is generally safe for this level of precision, but it's important to ensure that the precision is maintained throughout the calculations.

3. **Function Annotations**: The annotations for `func_1` indicate that it returns a map object of integers. However, the main program expects `func_1` to return four integers directly. This mismatch can lead to issues if the map object is not properly converted to a list or tuple before unpacking.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1 2 1 2
```
The expected output is:
```
0.666666666667
```

However, if the input is slightly different, such as:
```
1,2,1,2
```
The program will fail to parse the input correctly because `func_1` assumes a single space as the delimiter. This will result in an incorrect output or an error.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically the input parsing. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
