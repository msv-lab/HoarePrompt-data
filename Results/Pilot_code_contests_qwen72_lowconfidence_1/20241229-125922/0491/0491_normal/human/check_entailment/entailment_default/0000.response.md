Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the probability that SmallR will win the match based on the given probabilities of success for both SmallR and Zanoes. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads the input integers and returns them as a tuple. This is appropriate for the given problem description, which specifies that the input consists of four integers.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The probabilities of success for SmallR and Zanoes are calculated as `prob_a = a / b` and `prob_b = c / d`, respectively.
   - The initial probability that SmallR wins on the first turn is `prob_a`.
   - The accumulated probability of both players missing their shots is `(1 - prob_a) * (1 - prob_b)`.
   - The code uses a loop to iteratively add the probability of SmallR winning on subsequent turns, considering the accumulated probability of both players missing their shots up to that point.
   - The loop continues until the change in the probability (`now - prev`) is less than \(10^{-7}\), ensuring the result is accurate to within the required tolerance.

3. **Output**: The final probability is printed with six decimal places using `func_10('%.6f\n', now)`, which matches the problem description's requirement for the output format.

The code handles the problem correctly for all potential cases, including edge cases where the probabilities are extreme (e.g., 0 or 1). The iterative approach ensures that the probability calculation is accurate and converges to the correct value. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
