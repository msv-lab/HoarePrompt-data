Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to calculate the probability that SmallR will win the match against Zanoes. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads four integers from the input, which represent the numerators and denominators of the probabilities for SmallR and Zanoes. This matches the problem description.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The probabilities of SmallR and Zanoes hitting the target are calculated as `prob_a = a / b` and `prob_b = c / d`, respectively.
   - The initial probability that SmallR wins on the first shot is `now = prob_a`.
   - The program then calculates the probability of SmallR winning in subsequent rounds by considering the scenario where both miss their shots and the game continues. This is done using the loop:
     ```python
     while now - prev > 1e-07:
         prev = now
         ii += 1
         now += acc * prob_a
         acc *= (1 - prob_a) * (1 - prob_b)
     ```
     This loop continues until the change in the probability (`now - prev`) is less than a very small threshold (`1e-07`), ensuring that the result is accurate to within the required precision.

3. **Output**: The final probability is printed using `func_10('%.6f\n', now)`, which formats the result to 6 decimal places, as required by the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the probabilities are 0 or 1 correctly. For example, if `prob_a` is 1, the loop will terminate quickly since SmallR will win on the first shot.
   - The loop termination condition ensures that the program does not run indefinitely and provides a precise result.

Given these points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and produces the expected output for the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
