Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually solve the problem described. It includes several functions that are not used in the context of the problem. The problem requires calculating the probability that SmallR wins the match, but the program does not contain any logic to perform this calculation. Specifically, the program lacks:

1. Reading the input values (a, b, c, d).
2. Calculating the probabilities for SmallR and Zanoes.
3. Computing the probability that SmallR wins the match.
4. Printing the result with the required precision.

Since the program does not address the core requirements of the problem, it is incorrect.
