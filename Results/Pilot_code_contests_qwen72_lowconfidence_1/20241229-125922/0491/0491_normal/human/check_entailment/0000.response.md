Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. The problem requires calculating the probability that SmallR wins the match given the probabilities of SmallR and Zanoes hitting the target. However, the code only defines several functions (`func_1` to `func_10`) that are unrelated to the problem statement and do not perform the required calculation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
