You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: SmallR is an archer. SmallR is taking a match of archer with Zanoes. They try to shoot in the target in turns, and SmallR shoots first. The probability of shooting the target each time is <image> for SmallR while <image> for Zanoes. The one who shoots in the target first should be the winner.

Output the probability that SmallR will win the match.

Input

A single line contains four integers <image>.

Output

Print a single real number, the probability that SmallR will win the match.

The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 6.

Examples

Input

1 2 1 2


Output

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. The problem requires calculating the probability that SmallR wins the match given the probabilities of SmallR and Zanoes hitting the target. However, the code only defines several functions (`func_1` to `func_10`) that are unrelated to the problem statement and do not perform the required calculation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 10 : The function `func_10` accepts a single parameter `format`, which is expected to be a string representing a format pattern. It also implicitly accepts a variable-length argument list `*args`, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the function signature. The function writes a formatted string to `sys.stdout` using the provided format pattern and the corresponding values from `*args`. However, the function does not return any value, contrary to the annotation. If `*args` is not provided, the function will raise a `TypeError` because `args` is not defined. If `format` is not a valid format string, a `TypeError` or `ValueError` may also be raised. After the function executes, the formatted string is printed to the standard output, and the function does not return any value.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
