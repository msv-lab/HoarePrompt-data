The function `func_10` accepts a single parameter `format`, which is expected to be a string representing a format pattern. It also implicitly accepts a variable-length argument list `*args`, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the function signature. The function writes a formatted string to `sys.stdout` using the provided format pattern and the corresponding values from `*args`. However, the function does not return any value, contrary to the annotation. If `*args` is not provided, the function will raise a `TypeError` because `args` is not defined. If `format` is not a valid format string, a `TypeError` or `ValueError` may also be raised. After the function executes, the formatted string is printed to the standard output, and the function does not return any value.
