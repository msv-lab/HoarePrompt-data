The function `func_1` is not correctly defined based on the problem description. The function should take two parameters: an integer `n` representing the length of the array and a list of integers `a` representing the array elements. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(n, a):` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and `a` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
