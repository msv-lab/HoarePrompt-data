The code snippet `d[i].append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list located at index `i` in the dictionary `d`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 5 (not directly affected by this code)
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 5
- If the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `j` in list `a`, then `d[2]` includes 3 and 4. Otherwise, `d[2]` includes 3.

The code appends `j` (which is 5) to the list at `d[2]`. Depending on the condition, the updated list `d[2]` will be:

- If the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `j` in list `a`, then `d[2]` was `[3, 4]` and becomes `[3, 4, 5]`.
- Otherwise, `d[2]` was `[3]` and becomes `[3, 5]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `j` in list `a`, then `d[2]` is `[3, 4, 5]`. Otherwise, `d[2]` is `[3, 5]`.**
