To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\)
- `d` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n - 1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of `j` (which is `i + 1`) must be less than `n`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- `i + 1 < n`
- Since `i` is 1, this condition simplifies to `2 < n` or `n > 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `j` will start at `i + 1`, which is 2.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
