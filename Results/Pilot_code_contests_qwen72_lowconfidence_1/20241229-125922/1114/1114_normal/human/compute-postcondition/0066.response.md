The code snippet `d[i].sort(key=lambda x: (-a[x], -x))` sorts the list `d[2]` in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and, in case of ties, by the index `x` itself in descending order.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\)
- `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`
- `ans` includes the tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[0]` and `(2, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[1]`
- `i` is 2
- The elements of `a` at index 2 and the indices specified in `d[2]` are swapped
- `d[2]` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x`

After executing the code snippet:
- `d[2]` is now sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and, in case of ties, by the index `x` itself in descending order.

The values of `n`, `a`, `d`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the sorting of `d[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`, `ans` includes the tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[0]` and `(2, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[1]`, `i` is 2, the elements of `a` at index 2 and the indices specified in `d[2]` are swapped, `d[2]` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x`.**
