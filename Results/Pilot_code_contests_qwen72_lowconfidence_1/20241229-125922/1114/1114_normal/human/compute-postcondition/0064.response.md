To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the initial state and the effects of the loop over multiple iterations.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\).
- `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`.
- `ans` is a list of tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[0]`.
- `i` is 1.
- The elements of `a` are swapped according to the indices specified in `d[0]`.
- `d[1]` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in d[i]:
    ans.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each `j` in `d[1]`.
   - For each `j`, it appends the tuple `(2, j + 1)` to `ans`.
   - It swaps the elements at indices `1` and `j` in the list `a`.

2. **Effects After All Iterations**:
   - **`ans`**: Initially, `ans` contains tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[0]`. After the loop, it will also contain tuples `(2, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[1]`.
   - **`a`**: The elements at index `1` will be swapped with the elements at indices specified in `d[1]`.
   - **`i`**: Remains 1 throughout the loop.
   - **`d[1]`**: The list `d[1]` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x`.

3. **Final State**:
   - **`n`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - **`a`**: A list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\). The elements at index `1` and the indices specified in `d[1]` have been swapped.
   - **`d`**: A list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`.
   - **`ans`**: A list of tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[0]` and `(2, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[1]`.
   - **`i`**: 1.
   - **`d[1]`**: Sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x`.

### Output State:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`, `ans` includes the tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[0]` and `(2, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[1]`, `i` is 1, the elements of `a` at index 1 and the indices specified in `d[1]` are swapped, `d[1]` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x`.**
