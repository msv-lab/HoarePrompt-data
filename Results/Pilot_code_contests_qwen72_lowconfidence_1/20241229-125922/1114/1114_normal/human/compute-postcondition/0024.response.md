The code `d[i].append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list located at the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 4.
- `n` must be greater than 4.

The value 4 (which is `j`) is appended to the list at the key 1 (which is `i`) in the dictionary `d`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` remains 1, `j` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `d[1]` includes 4.**
