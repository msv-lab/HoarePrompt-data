The code snippet appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 0, the first element of the tuple will be `1`. The value of `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but given that `d[0]` is a list of indices `j` and `d[0]` must contain at least one element, we can infer that `j` is the first element of `d[0]`.

Thus, the tuple `(1, d[0][0] + 1)` is appended to `ans`.

The updated state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\)
- `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`
- `d[0]` is sorted in decreasing order of `a[j]` and then by decreasing order of `j`
- `d[0]` must contain at least one element
- `ans` is now a list containing the tuple `(1, d[0][0] + 1)`
- `i` is 0

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`, `d[0]` is sorted in decreasing order of `a[j]` and then by decreasing order of `j`, `d[0]` must contain at least one element, `ans` is a list containing the tuple `(1, d[0][0] + 1)`, `i` is 0**
