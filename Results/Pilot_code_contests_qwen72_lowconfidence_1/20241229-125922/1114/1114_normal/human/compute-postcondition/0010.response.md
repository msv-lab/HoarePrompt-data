Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists. If `a[0] > a[2]`, `d[0]` now includes the value 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `d`. `j` remains 2.***
