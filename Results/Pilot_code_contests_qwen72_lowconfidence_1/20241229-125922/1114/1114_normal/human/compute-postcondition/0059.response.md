The code snippet `ans.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a new tuple to the list `ans`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\).
- `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`.
- `ans` is a list of tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[0]` and now includes the tuple `(2, j + 1)`.
- `i` is 1.
- The elements of `a` are swapped according to the indices specified in `d[0]`.
- `d[1]` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x`.
- `d[1]` must contain at least one element.
- `j` is the next element in `d[1]`.

After executing the code snippet:

- The value of `i` is 1.
- The value of `j` remains the next element in `d[1]`.
- The list `ans` is updated to include the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, which is `(2, j + 1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`, `ans` is a list of tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[0]` and now includes the tuples `(2, j + 1)` and `(3, j + 1)`, `i` is 1, the elements of `a` are swapped according to the indices specified in `d[0]`, `d[1]` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x`, `d[1]` must contain at least one element, `j` is the next element in `d[1]`.**
