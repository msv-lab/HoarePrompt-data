To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ len(a).
- `d` is a list of `n` empty lists.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Range of `xrange(i + 1, n)`**:
   - The loop will iterate over values of `j` starting from `i + 1` up to, but not including, `n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, `i + 1` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `1 < n` must be true.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `n` is already constrained to be between 1 and 1000, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `i` is already 0, which is correct for the loop to start.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `a` and `d` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The initial state of `i` being 0 is correct. The other variables (`a` and `d`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ len(a), `d` is a list of `n` empty lists**
