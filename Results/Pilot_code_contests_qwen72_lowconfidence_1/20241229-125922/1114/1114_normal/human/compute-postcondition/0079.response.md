The code snippet `stdout.write(''.join('%d %d\n' % (x, y) for x, y in ans))` writes each tuple in the list `ans` to the standard output, formatted as two integers separated by a space and followed by a newline.

### Impact of the Code:
- The code does not modify any of the variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `ans`).
- The content of `ans` is written to the standard output, with each tuple `(x, y)` printed as `x y` on a new line.

### Output State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\).
- `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`.
- `ans` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and each `j` in `d[i]`.
- The elements of `a` have been swapped according to the indices specified in `d` such that for each `i` and `j` in `d[i]`, `a[i]` and `a[j]` have been swapped.
- `d` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x` for each `i`.
- Each tuple in `ans` has been written to the standard output, formatted as `x y` on a new line.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`, `ans` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and each `j` in `d[i]`, the elements of `a` have been swapped according to the indices specified in `d` such that for each `i` and `j` in `d[i]`, `a[i]` and `a[j]` have been swapped, and `d` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x` for each `i`. Each tuple in `ans` has been written to the standard output, formatted as `x y` on a new line.**
