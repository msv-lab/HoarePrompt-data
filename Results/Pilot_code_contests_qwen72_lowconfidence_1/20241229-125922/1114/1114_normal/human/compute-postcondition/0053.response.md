To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\).
- `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`.
- `ans` is a list of tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[0]`.
- `i` is 0.
- The elements of `a` are swapped according to the indices specified in `d[0]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `d` is a list of lists.
   - `ans` is a list of tuples.
   - Elements of `a` have been swapped according to `d[0]`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- The loop will continue if `i` (which is now 1) is less than `n`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`, `ans` is a list of tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[0]`, `i` is 1, and the elements of `a` are swapped according to the indices specified in `d[0]`**.
