Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`, `ans` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and each `j` in `d[i]`, the elements of `a` have been swapped according to the indices specified in `d` such that for each `i` and `j` in `d[i]`, `a[i]` and `a[j]` have been swapped, and `d` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x` for each `i`.**
