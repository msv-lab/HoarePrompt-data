To analyze the final state of the variables after the loop has completed its execution, we need to consider the initial state and how the loop modifies the variables during each iteration.

**Initial State:**
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\).
- `d` is a list of `n` lists.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

**Loop Code:**
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    if a[i] > a[j]:
        d[i].append(j)
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` starts at 1.
   - `j` iterates from `i + 1` (which is 2) to `n - 1`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `j` from 2 to `n - 1`, the loop checks if `a[i] > a[j]`.
   - If the condition is true, `j` is appended to `d[i]`.

3. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - `i` remains 1 because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `j` will have iterated through all values from 2 to `n - 1`.
   - `d[i]` (which is `d[1]`) will contain all indices `j` such that `a[1] > a[j]` for \(2 \leq j < n\).

**Conclusion:**
- `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `a` remains a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\).
- `d` remains a list of `n` lists.
- `i` remains 1.
- `d[1]` contains all indices `j` (where \(2 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[1] > a[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `d[1]` contains all indices `j` (where \(2 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[1] > a[j]`.**
