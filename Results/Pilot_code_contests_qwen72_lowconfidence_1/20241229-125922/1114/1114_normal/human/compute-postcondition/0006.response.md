The code snippet `d[i].append(j)` adds the value `j` to the list `d[i]`. Given the initial state, the following changes occur:

- `d[i]` now contains one additional element, which is `j`.
- All other conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ len(a), `d` is a list of `n` lists where `d[i]` now contains the element `j`, and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[j]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ len(a), `d` is a list of `n` lists where `d[i]` now contains the element `j`, and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[j]`**.
