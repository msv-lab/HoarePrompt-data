Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3. If `a[i]` > `a[j]`, then `d[1]` now includes the value 2. Otherwise, `d[1]` remains unchanged.***
