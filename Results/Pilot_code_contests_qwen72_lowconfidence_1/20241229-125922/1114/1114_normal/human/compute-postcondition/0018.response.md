The code `d[i].append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list located at index `i` in the list `d`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 1000\),
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\),
- `d` is a list of `n` lists,
- `i` is 1,
- `j` is 2,
- the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[j]`.

After executing the code:

- The list `d[1]` now includes the value 2 (since `j` is 2 and `i` is 1).

The values of `n`, `a`, `d` (other than the change to `d[1]`), `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[j]`, `d[1]` is now a list that includes the value 2.**
