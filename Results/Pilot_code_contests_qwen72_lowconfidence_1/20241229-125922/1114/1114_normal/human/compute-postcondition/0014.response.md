To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\).
   - `d` is a list of `n` empty lists.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for j in range(i + 1, n):
       if a[i] > a[j]:
           d[i].append(j)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n - 1`.
   - For each `j` in this range, if `a[i]` is greater than `a[j]`, `j` is appended to the list `d[i]`.
   - This means that after the loop finishes, `d[i]` will contain the indices of all elements in `a` that are less than `a[i]` and come after `a[i]` in the list.

4. **Output State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `i` will still be 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `n` will remain the same as it was initially.
   - `a` will remain the same as it was initially.
   - `d` will be a list of `n` lists, where `d[0]` contains the indices of all elements in `a` that are less than `a[0]` and come after `a[0]` in the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, and `d[0]` contains the indices of all elements in `a` that are less than `a[0]` and come after `a[0]` in the list.**
