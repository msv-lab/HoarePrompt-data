To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` is greater than 3.
  - `i` is 2.
  - `j` is 3.
  - If the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `j` in list `a`, then `d[2]` includes 3.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to but not including `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 3, and `i` was 2.
   - Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `n`.
   - Since `j` is currently 3, the next value of `j` will be 4.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - `j` needs to be incremented to 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` is now 4.
- The condition about `d[2]` including 3 remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `j` in list `a`, then `d[2]` includes 3.**
