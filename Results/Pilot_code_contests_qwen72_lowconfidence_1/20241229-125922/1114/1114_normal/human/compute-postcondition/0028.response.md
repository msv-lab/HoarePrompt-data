To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\)
- `d` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 2
- `d[2]` contains all indices `j` (where \(3 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[2] > a[j]`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `(i + 1, n)` is non-empty. This means that `i + 1` must be less than `n`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - Therefore, `i + 1` is 3.
   - The loop will execute if `3 < n`.

### Adjusted State:
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 3.
- The variable `j` will start at 3 and go up to `n-1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
