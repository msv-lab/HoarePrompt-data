The code snippet `d[i].sort(key=lambda x: (-a[x], -x))` sorts the list `d[i]` in place based on the values of `a[x]` and `x` in descending order. Specifically, it first sorts by the values of `a[x]` in descending order, and if there are ties, it sorts by the indices `x` in descending order.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\)
- `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`
- `ans` is a list of tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[0]`
- `i` is 1
- The elements of `a` are swapped according to the indices specified in `d[0]`

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `d[1]` is sorted in place based on the values of `a[x]` and `x` in descending order.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`, `ans` is a list of tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` in `d[0]`, `i` is 1, the elements of `a` are swapped according to the indices specified in `d[0]`, and `d[1]` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x`.**
