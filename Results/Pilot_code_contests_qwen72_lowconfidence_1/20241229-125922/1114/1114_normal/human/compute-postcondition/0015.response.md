To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\).
- `d` is a list of `n` lists.
- `i` is 0.
- `d[0]` contains the indices of all elements in `a` that are less than `a[0]` and come after `a[0]` in the list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).

### Next Iteration:
- **Increment `i`**: After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
- **Condition Check**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is now 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Additional Considerations:
- The state of `a` and `d` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to these variables.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1**.
