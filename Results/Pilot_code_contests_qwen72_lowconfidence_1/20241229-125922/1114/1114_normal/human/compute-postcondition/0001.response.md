The code `a = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the variable `a`. This means that `a` is now a list (or more accurately, a map object which can be converted to a list) of integers.

The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and `a` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. After the code is executed, `a` will contain the integers read from the input, and the length of `a` will be determined by the number of integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ len(a)**.
