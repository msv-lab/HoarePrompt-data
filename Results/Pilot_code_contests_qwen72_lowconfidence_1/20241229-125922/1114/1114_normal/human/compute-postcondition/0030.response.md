The code snippet `d[i].append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list located at the index `i` of dictionary `d`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, this means that the number 3 is appended to the list that `d[2]` points to. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `j` in list `a`, `d[2]` includes 3.**
