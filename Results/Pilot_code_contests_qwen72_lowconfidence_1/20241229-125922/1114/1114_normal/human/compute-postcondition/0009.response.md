The code `d[i].append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 2) to the list `d[i]` (where `i` is 0). Since `i` is 0, this operation modifies the first list in `d`. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists where `d[0]` now includes the value 2, `j` is 2**.
