To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 1000\).
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\).
- `d` is a list of `n` lists.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 2.
- If `a[i]` > `a[j]`, then `d[1]` is now a list that includes the value 2.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n - 1`. Given `i` is 1, the loop iterates from `2` to `n - 1`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 1000\).

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3.
- For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 3.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3. If `a[i]` > `a[j]`, then `d[1]` is now a list that includes the value 2.**
