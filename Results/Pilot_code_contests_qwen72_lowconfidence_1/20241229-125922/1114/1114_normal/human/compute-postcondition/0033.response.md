The code `d[i].append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list at index `i` in the dictionary `d`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is greater than 4
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 4
- If the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `j` in list `a`, then `d[2]` includes 3.

The code will append the value of `j` (which is 4) to the list at index `i` (which is 2) in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` is 2, the specific action is to append 4 to `d[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, if the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `j` in list `a`, then `d[2]` includes 3 and 4.**
