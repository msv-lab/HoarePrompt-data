The code `d[i].append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `d[i]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, this means that the value 3 is appended to the list `d[1]`.

- The condition `if a[i] > a[j]` is not checked in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the execution.
- The value of `n` remains an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 1000\) and `n` must be greater than 3.
- The value of `a` remains a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\).
- The value of `d` is updated: `d[1]` now includes the value 3.
- The values of `i` and `j` remain 1 and 3, respectively.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists where `d[1]` now includes the value 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3.**
