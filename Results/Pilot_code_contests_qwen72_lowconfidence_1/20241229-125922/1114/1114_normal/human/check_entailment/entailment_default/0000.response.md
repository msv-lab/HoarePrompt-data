Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that all pairs in the list are distinct and form an inversion in the array, and it also does not guarantee that the array will be sorted in non-decreasing order after processing all pairs.

Here is a detailed analysis of the issues:

1. **Sorting Key**: The sorting key used in the program is `key=lambda x: (-a[x], -x)`, which sorts the indices `j` in descending order based on the values `a[j]` and `j`. This can lead to incorrect swaps because it does not necessarily process the inversions in a way that ensures the array will be sorted correctly.

2. **Distinct Pairs**: The program does not explicitly check for distinct pairs. While it constructs pairs based on inversions, it does not ensure that these pairs are unique. This could lead to redundant swaps.

3. **Final Array State**: The program modifies the array `a` during the process of constructing the list of swaps. However, it does not verify whether the final state of the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This means that even if the program generates a list of swaps, it is not guaranteed that the array will be sorted after applying all the swaps.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
3 2 1 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
1 2
1 3
2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might produce a different sequence of swaps that does not sort the array correctly.

For the program to be correct, it should ensure that:
- All pairs in the list are distinct and form an inversion.
- After processing all pairs, the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given the current implementation, the program does not meet these requirements, hence it is incorrect.
