Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input array is already sorted. According to the problem description, if the array is already sorted, the output should be `0`, indicating that no inversions need to be swapped. However, the current implementation does not check if the array is already sorted and will still attempt to find inversions, leading to incorrect output.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 2 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
0
```

However, the current program will incorrectly output:
```
0
```

This is because the program does not explicitly check if the array is already sorted and instead proceeds to find inversions, which do not exist in this case. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for this specific case.
