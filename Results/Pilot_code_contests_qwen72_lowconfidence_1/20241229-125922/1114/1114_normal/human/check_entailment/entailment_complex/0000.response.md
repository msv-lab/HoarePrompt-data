Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined without any parameters. According to the problem description, the function should take two parameters: an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, a):`.

2. **Input Handling**: The function uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This can cause issues if the program is run in a Python 3 environment.

3. **Sorting Criteria**: The sorting key in the line `d[i].sort(key=lambda x: (-a[x], -x))` sorts the indices in descending order of both `a[x]` and `x`. However, the problem description does not specify the exact order in which the inversions should be processed. The current sorting criteria might lead to unnecessary complexity and could potentially result in an incorrect sequence of swaps.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is not strictly adhered to. The problem description specifies that if no such list exists, the program should print `-1`. The provided program does not check for this condition and always prints the list of swaps.

5. **Guaranteed Sorting**: The program assumes that the list of swaps will always result in a sorted array. However, the problem description requires that the array should be sorted in non-decreasing order after processing all pairs. The program does not explicitly verify that the array is sorted after performing the swaps.

To correct these issues, the function should be redefined to take the required parameters, use the appropriate input function, and ensure that the output format and the final state of the array meet the problem's requirements. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    d = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                d[i].append(j)
    
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        d[i].sort(key=lambda x: (a[x], x))
        
        for j in d[i]:
            ans.append((i + 1, j + 1))
            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]
    
    if a != sorted(a):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ans))
        for x, y in ans:
            print(x, y)

# Example usage
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
func_1(n, a)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function takes the correct parameters, uses the appropriate input function, and verifies that the array is sorted after performing the swaps. If the array is not sorted, it prints `-1` as required.
