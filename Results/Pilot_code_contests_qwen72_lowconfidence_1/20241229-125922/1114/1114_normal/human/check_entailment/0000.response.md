Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted. According to the problem statement, if the array is already sorted, the output should be `0` with no pairs. However, the current implementation will still attempt to find inversions and output pairs, even though the array is already sorted. For example, if the input is:
```
5
1 1 1 2 2
```
The program will incorrectly output pairs, instead of `0`. This violates the requirement that the program should output `0` when the array is already sorted.
