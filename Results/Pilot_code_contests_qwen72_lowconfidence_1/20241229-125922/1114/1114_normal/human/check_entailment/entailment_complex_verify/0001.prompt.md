You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Madeline has an array a of n integers. A pair (u, v) of integers forms an inversion in a if:

  * 1 ≤ u < v ≤ n. 
  * a_u > a_v. 



Madeline recently found a magical paper, which allows her to write two indices u and v and swap the values a_u and a_v. Being bored, she decided to write a list of pairs (u_i, v_i) with the following conditions:

  * all the pairs in the list are distinct and form an inversion in a. 
  * all the pairs that form an inversion in a are in the list. 
  * Starting from the given array, if you swap the values at indices u_1 and v_1, then the values at indices u_2 and v_2 and so on, then after all pairs are processed, the array a will be sorted in non-decreasing order. 



Construct such a list or determine that no such list exists. If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the length of the array.

Next line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array.

Output

Print -1 if no such list exists. Otherwise in the first line you should print a single integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)) — number of pairs in the list.

The i-th of the following m lines should contain two integers u_i, v_i (1 ≤ u_i < v_i≤ n).

If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.

Note

In the first sample test case the array will change in this order [3,1,2] → [2,1,3] → [1,2,3].

In the second sample test case it will be [1,8,1,6] → [1,6,1,8] → [1,1,6,8].

In the third sample test case the array is already sorted.
Program:
```
from sys import stdout

func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    d = [[] for _ in xrange(n)]
    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                d[i].append(j)
    ans = []
    for i in xrange(n):
        d[i].sort(key=lambda x: (-a[x], -x))
        for j in d[i]:
            ans.append((i + 1, j + 1))
            (a[i], a[j]) = (a[j], a[i])
    stdout.write(str(len(ans)) + '\n')
    stdout.write(''.join(('%d %d\n' % (x, y) for (x, y) in ans)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input array is already sorted. According to the problem description, if the array is already sorted, the output should be `0`, indicating that no inversions need to be swapped. However, the current implementation does not check if the array is already sorted and will still attempt to find inversions, leading to incorrect output.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 2 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
0
```

However, the current program will incorrectly output:
```
0
```

This is because the program does not explicitly check if the array is already sorted and instead proceeds to find inversions, which do not exist in this case. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for this specific case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdout

func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not correctly defined based on the problem description. The function should take two parameters: an integer `n` representing the length of the array and a list of integers `a` representing the array elements. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(n, a):` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and `a` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    d = [[] for _ in xrange(n)]
    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                d[i].append(j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`.
    ans = []
    for i in xrange(n):
        d[i].sort(key=lambda x: (-a[x], -x))
        
        for j in d[i]:
            ans.append((i + 1, j + 1))
            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq \text{len}(a)\), `d` is a list of `n` lists, where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (where \(i + 1 \leq j < n\)) such that `a[i] > a[j]`, `ans` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and each `j` in `d[i]`, the elements of `a` have been swapped according to the indices specified in `d` such that for each `i` and `j` in `d[i]`, `a[i]` and `a[j]` have been swapped, and `d` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x` for each `i`.
    stdout.write(str(len(ans)) + '\n')
    stdout.write(''.join('%d %d\n' % (x, y) for x, y in ans))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two inputs: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). It then constructs a list of lists `d` where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (i + 1 ≤ j < n) such that `a[i] > a[j]`. The function sorts each `d[i]` based on the values of `a[j]` and `j` in descending order. For each pair `(i, j)` in the sorted `d[i]`, the function swaps the elements `a[i]` and `a[j]` and records the swap in a list `ans`. Finally, the function prints the number of swaps performed and the details of each swap. The final state of the program includes the modified list `a` where elements have been swapped according to the rules described, and the list `ans` containing the details of all swaps.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
