**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is called without any arguments, but the problem description requires that the function should take two parameters: `n` (the length of the array) and `a` (the array itself). The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, a):`.

2. **Input Handling**: The function reads input using `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This is a minor issue, but it can cause the program to fail if run in a Python 3 environment.

3. **Inversion Handling**: The program collects all inversions and sorts them, but it does not ensure that the swaps will result in a sorted array. The problem description requires that the list of pairs should be such that after processing all pairs, the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The current implementation does not guarantee this.

4. **Sorting Inversions**: The program sorts the inversions in descending order based on the values of `a[x]` and `x`. However, the order of swaps is crucial to ensure the final array is sorted. Simply sorting the inversions in this manner does not guarantee that the array will be sorted correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array is already sorted or contains duplicate elements. For example, in the case where the array is already sorted, the program should output `0` pairs, but it does not explicitly check for this condition.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the input:
```
4
4 3 2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
6
1 4
1 3
1 2
2 4
2 3
3 4
```

However, the provided program might output a different sequence of swaps that does not result in a sorted array.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that the array is sorted after processing all the inversions. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
