You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Madeline has an array a of n integers. A pair (u, v) of integers forms an inversion in a if:

  * 1 ≤ u < v ≤ n. 
  * a_u > a_v. 



Madeline recently found a magical paper, which allows her to write two indices u and v and swap the values a_u and a_v. Being bored, she decided to write a list of pairs (u_i, v_i) with the following conditions:

  * all the pairs in the list are distinct and form an inversion in a. 
  * all the pairs that form an inversion in a are in the list. 
  * Starting from the given array, if you swap the values at indices u_1 and v_1, then the values at indices u_2 and v_2 and so on, then after all pairs are processed, the array a will be sorted in non-decreasing order. 



Construct such a list or determine that no such list exists. If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the length of the array.

Next line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array.

Output

Print -1 if no such list exists. Otherwise in the first line you should print a single integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)) — number of pairs in the list.

The i-th of the following m lines should contain two integers u_i, v_i (1 ≤ u_i < v_i≤ n).

If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.

Examples

Input


3
3 1 2


Output


2
1 3
1 2


Input


4
1 8 1 6


Output


2
2 4
2 3


Input


5
1 1 1 2 2


Output


0

Note

In the first sample test case the array will change in this order [3,1,2] → [2,1,3] → [1,2,3].

In the second sample test case it will be [1,8,1,6] → [1,6,1,8] → [1,1,6,8].

In the third sample test case the array is already sorted.
Program:
```
from sys import stdout

func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    d = [[] for _ in xrange(n)]
    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                d[i].append(j)
    ans = []
    for i in xrange(n):
        d[i].sort(key=lambda x: (-a[x], -x))
        for j in d[i]:
            ans.append((i + 1, j + 1))
            (a[i], a[j]) = (a[j], a[i])
    stdout.write(str(len(ans)) + '\n')
    stdout.write(''.join(('%d %d\n' % (x, y) for (x, y) in ans)))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
