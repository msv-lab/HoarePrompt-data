Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program does not ensure that all inversions are included in the list and that the array is sorted in non-decreasing order after processing all the swaps. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Inversion Handling**: The program only considers inversions where `a[i] > a[j]` and sorts the indices based on the values of `a[j]` and `j` in descending order. However, it does not guarantee that all inversions are handled in a way that ensures the array will be sorted after all swaps.

2. **Sorting Order**: The sorting key `(-a[x], -x)` ensures that the largest values and indices are processed first, but this does not necessarily lead to a sorted array. The correct approach would be to ensure that the swaps are made in such a way that the smallest possible value is moved to its correct position first.

3. **Example Case Failure**: Consider the input:
   ```
   4
   4 3 2 1
   ```
   The expected output should be:
   ```
   6
   1 4
   1 3
   1 2
   2 4
   2 3
   3 4
   ```
   However, the provided program will not generate the correct sequence of swaps to sort the array.

To fix these issues, the program needs to ensure that all inversions are considered and that the swaps are made in a way that guarantees the array will be sorted after processing all pairs. A more robust approach would involve using a data structure like a balanced binary search tree or a segment tree to efficiently manage and process inversions.
