You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Madeline has an array a of n integers. A pair (u, v) of integers forms an inversion in a if:

  * 1 ≤ u < v ≤ n. 
  * a_u > a_v. 



Madeline recently found a magical paper, which allows her to write two indices u and v and swap the values a_u and a_v. Being bored, she decided to write a list of pairs (u_i, v_i) with the following conditions:

  * all the pairs in the list are distinct and form an inversion in a. 
  * all the pairs that form an inversion in a are in the list. 
  * Starting from the given array, if you swap the values at indices u_1 and v_1, then the values at indices u_2 and v_2 and so on, then after all pairs are processed, the array a will be sorted in non-decreasing order. 



Construct such a list or determine that no such list exists. If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the length of the array.

Next line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array.

Output

Print -1 if no such list exists. Otherwise in the first line you should print a single integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)) — number of pairs in the list.

The i-th of the following m lines should contain two integers u_i, v_i (1 ≤ u_i < v_i≤ n).

If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.

Note

In the first sample test case the array will change in this order [3,1,2] → [2,1,3] → [1,2,3].

In the second sample test case it will be [1,8,1,6] → [1,6,1,8] → [1,1,6,8].

In the third sample test case the array is already sorted.
Program:
```
from sys import stdout

func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    d = [[] for _ in xrange(n)]
    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                d[i].append(j)
    ans = []
    for i in xrange(n):
        d[i].sort(key=lambda x: (-a[x], -x))
        for j in d[i]:
            ans.append((i + 1, j + 1))
            (a[i], a[j]) = (a[j], a[i])
    stdout.write(str(len(ans)) + '\n')
    stdout.write(''.join(('%d %d\n' % (x, y) for (x, y) in ans)))


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` reads two inputs: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). It then constructs a list of lists `d` where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (i + 1 ≤ j < n) such that `a[i] > a[j]`. The function sorts each `d[i]` based on the values of `a[j]` and `j` in descending order. For each pair `(i, j)` in the sorted `d[i]`, the function swaps the elements `a[i]` and `a[j]` and records the swap in a list `ans`. Finally, the function prints the number of swaps performed and the details of each swap. The final state of the program includes the modified list `a` where elements have been swapped according to the rules described, and the list `ans` containing the details of all swaps.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
