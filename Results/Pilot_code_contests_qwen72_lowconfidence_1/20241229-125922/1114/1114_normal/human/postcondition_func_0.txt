The function `func_1` reads two inputs: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). It then constructs a list of lists `d` where each `d[i]` contains the indices `j` (i + 1 ≤ j < n) such that `a[i] > a[j]`. The function sorts each `d[i]` based on the values of `a[j]` and `j` in descending order. For each pair `(i, j)` in the sorted `d[i]`, the function swaps the elements `a[i]` and `a[j]` and records the swap in a list `ans`. Finally, the function prints the number of swaps performed and the details of each swap. The final state of the program includes the modified list `a` where elements have been swapped according to the rules described, and the list `ans` containing the details of all swaps.
