t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; for each of the m roads, x_i, y_i, and s_i are integers where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n, x_i ≠ y_i, and 1 ≤ s_i ≤ 10^9; the road network is connected and each pair of cities is connected by at most one road; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
