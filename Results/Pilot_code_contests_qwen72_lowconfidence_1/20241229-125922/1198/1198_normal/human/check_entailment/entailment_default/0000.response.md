Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Initialization of Auxiliary Tables**:
   - The function `create_table()` is supposed to initialize the auxiliary tables, but it does not take `n` and `m` as parameters. This means it will raise a `NameError` because `n` and `m` are not defined in its scope. The correct implementation should be:
     ```python
     def create_table(n, m):
         return [[1 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
     ```
   - Without the correct initialization, the auxiliary tables (`top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`) will not be initialized properly, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle the case where the grid is empty (both `n` and `m` are 0). While the problem description does not explicitly mention this case, it is a valid edge case that should be handled. The function should return 0 in this case.
   - The code does not handle the case where the grid has only one row or one column. In these cases, the function will not update the auxiliary tables for cells that do not have the required neighbors, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Correctness of Pattern Counting**:
   - The logic for updating the auxiliary tables and calculating the final score is correct for the given problem description. However, due to the issues mentioned above, the function will not produce the correct results for all potential cases.

Given these issues, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, it is incorrect.
