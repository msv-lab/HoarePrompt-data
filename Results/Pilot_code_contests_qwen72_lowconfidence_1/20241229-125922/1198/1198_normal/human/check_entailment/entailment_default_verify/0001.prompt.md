You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Carousel Boutique is busy again! Rarity has decided to visit the pony ball and she surely needs a new dress, because going out in the same dress several times is a sign of bad manners. First of all, she needs a dress pattern, which she is going to cut out from the rectangular piece of the multicolored fabric.

The piece of the multicolored fabric consists of n × m separate square scraps. Since Rarity likes dresses in style, a dress pattern must only include scraps sharing the same color. A dress pattern must be the square, and since Rarity is fond of rhombuses, the sides of a pattern must form a 45^{\circ} angle with sides of a piece of fabric (that way it will be resembling the traditional picture of a rhombus).

Examples of proper dress patterns: <image> Examples of improper dress patterns: <image> The first one consists of multi-colored scraps, the second one goes beyond the bounds of the piece of fabric, the third one is not a square with sides forming a 45^{\circ} angle with sides of the piece of fabric.

Rarity wonders how many ways to cut out a dress pattern that satisfies all the conditions that do exist. Please help her and satisfy her curiosity so she can continue working on her new masterpiece!

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). Each of the next n lines contains m characters: lowercase English letters, the j-th of which corresponds to scrap in the current line and in the j-th column. Scraps having the same letter share the same color, scraps having different letters have different colors.

Output

Print a single integer: the number of ways to cut out a dress pattern to satisfy all of Rarity's conditions.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid dress patterns that meet Rarity's conditions. It constructs four dynamic programming tables (`top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`) to track the maximum size of a valid square pattern centered at each cell, considering the 45° angle constraint. The final count of valid patterns is derived by taking the minimum value among these four tables for each cell, which ensures that the pattern is a square and fits within the fabric. The program handles edge cases such as single-cell patterns and ensures that the pattern remains within the bounds of the fabric. Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 4 : The function `create_table` is intended to accept two parameters `m` and `n`, both positive integers, and return a list of lists where each inner list contains `m` elements set to 1, and there are `n` such inner lists. However, the function as written does not actually accept any parameters, which means it will result in a `NameError` when `m` and `n` are not defined in the global scope. If `m` and `n` are defined externally, the function will behave as described in the annotations. Therefore, the function should be modified to accept `m` and `n` as parameters to ensure it works correctly. After the function executes, assuming `m` and `n` are defined, it will return a 2D list (a list of lists) with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is 1.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
