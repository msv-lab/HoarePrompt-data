Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code does not fully adhere to the problem description in every potential case. Specifically, the function `create_table()` is not correctly implemented. The function is supposed to initialize a 2D list with dimensions `n` x `m`, where each element is initially set to 1. However, the function does not accept any parameters, leading to a `NameError` if `n` and `m` are not defined in the global scope. This is a critical issue because the `create_table()` function is called multiple times within `func_3()` to initialize the auxiliary tables (`top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`).

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **`create_table()` Function:**
   - **Issue:** The function `create_table()` does not accept any parameters (`n` and `m`), which are necessary to determine the dimensions of the table to be created.
   - **Impact:** When `create_table()` is called in `func_3()`, it will raise a `NameError` if `n` and `m` are not defined in the global scope. This will prevent the program from running correctly.
   - **Fix:** The function should be modified to accept `n` and `m` as parameters:
     ```python
     def create_table(n, m):
         return [[1 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
     ```

2. **Initialization of Auxiliary Tables:**
   - **Issue:** The auxiliary tables (`top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`) are initialized using `create_table()`, which is currently incorrect due to the missing parameters.
   - **Impact:** The auxiliary tables will not be properly initialized, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially incorrect results.
   - **Fix:** Ensure that `create_table()` is called with the correct parameters:
     ```python
     top_left = create_table(n, m)
     top_right = create_table(n, m)
     bottom_left = create_table(n, m)
     bottom_right = create_table(n, m)
     ```

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Issue:** The code does not handle edge cases where `n` or `m` is 0. While the problem description states that `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, it is good practice to handle such edge cases explicitly.
   - **Impact:** If `n` or `m` is 0, the program should return 0, but the current implementation may raise errors or produce incorrect results.
   - **Fix:** Add a check at the beginning of `func_3()` to handle these edge cases:
     ```python
     if n == 0 or m == 0:
         return 0
     ```

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
