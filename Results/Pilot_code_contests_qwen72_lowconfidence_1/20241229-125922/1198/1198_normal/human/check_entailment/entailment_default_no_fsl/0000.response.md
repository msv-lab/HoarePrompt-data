Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code has a few issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case according to the problem description:

1. **Initialization of Auxiliary Tables**: The `create_table` function is called without passing the necessary parameters `n` and `m`. This will result in a `NameError` because `n` and `m` are not defined in the scope of `create_table`. The correct implementation should pass `n` and `m` to `create_table` to initialize the tables correctly.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function does not explicitly handle the case where `n` or `m` is 0. While the problem description specifies that `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, it is good practice to handle edge cases gracefully. If `n` or `m` were 0, the function would still attempt to initialize the tables, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

3. **Input Validation**: Although the problem description guarantees valid input, the code does not handle cases where the input might be malformed (e.g., if the grid dimensions are not followed by the correct number of rows or if the rows are not of the correct length). While this is not strictly necessary given the problem constraints, it is a potential issue if the input is not strictly controlled.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and therefore, it is incorrect.
