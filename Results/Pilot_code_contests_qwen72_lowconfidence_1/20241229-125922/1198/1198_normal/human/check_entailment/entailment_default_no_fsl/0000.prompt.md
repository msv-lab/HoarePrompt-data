You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Carousel Boutique is busy again! Rarity has decided to visit the pony ball and she surely needs a new dress, because going out in the same dress several times is a sign of bad manners. First of all, she needs a dress pattern, which she is going to cut out from the rectangular piece of the multicolored fabric.

The piece of the multicolored fabric consists of n × m separate square scraps. Since Rarity likes dresses in style, a dress pattern must only include scraps sharing the same color. A dress pattern must be the square, and since Rarity is fond of rhombuses, the sides of a pattern must form a 45^{\circ} angle with sides of a piece of fabric (that way it will be resembling the traditional picture of a rhombus).

Examples of proper dress patterns: <image> Examples of improper dress patterns: <image> The first one consists of multi-colored scraps, the second one goes beyond the bounds of the piece of fabric, the third one is not a square with sides forming a 45^{\circ} angle with sides of the piece of fabric.

Rarity wonders how many ways to cut out a dress pattern that satisfies all the conditions that do exist. Please help her and satisfy her curiosity so she can continue working on her new masterpiece!

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). Each of the next n lines contains m characters: lowercase English letters, the j-th of which corresponds to scrap in the current line and in the j-th column. Scraps having the same letter share the same color, scraps having different letters have different colors.

Output

Print a single integer: the number of ways to cut out a dress pattern to satisfy all of Rarity's conditions.

Functions with output description for each function:
from __future__ import division, print_function

from atexit import register

if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    from io import BytesIO as stream
else:
    from io import StringIO as stream
sys.stdin = stream(sys.stdin.read())
input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(func_3())

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input and returns it. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that an integer value, which was provided by the user via standard input, is returned. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the user inputs a non-integer value, which would result in a `ValueError` being raised. Additionally, if the standard input is closed or unavailable, the function will raise an `EOFError`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty or consists only of spaces, an empty list will be returned.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    (n, m) = func_2()

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` processes a fabric represented by a grid of colors (a list of strings) and calculates a score based on the patterns of colors in the grid. Specifically, it initializes four auxiliary tables (`top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`) to store the sizes of square patterns found in the fabric. These tables are updated based on the following conditions:

1. For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid:
   - If `i > 0` and `j > 0` and the colors of the cells `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i, j)` are the same, `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i-1][j], top_left[i][j-1]) + 1`.
   - If `i > 0` and `j < m-1` and the colors of the cells `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j+1)`, and `(i, j)` are the same, `top_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_right[i-1][j], top_right[i][j+1]) + 1`.
   - If `i < n-1` and `j > 0` and the colors of the cells `(i+1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i, j)` are the same, `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_left[i+1][j], bottom_left[i][j-1]) + 1`.
   - If `i < n-1` and `j < m-1` and the colors of the cells `(i+1, j)`, `(i, j+1)`, and `(i, j)` are the same, `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_right[i+1][j], bottom_right[i][j+1]) + 1`.

2. After updating these tables, the function calculates the final score by summing the minimum values of `top_left[i][j]`, `top_right[i][j]`, `bottom_left[i][j]`, and `bottom_right[i][j]` for each cell `(i, j)` in the grid.

3. The function returns this score.

Edge Cases:
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 0 because there are no rows in the grid.
- If `m` is 0, the function also returns 0 because there are no columns in the grid.
- If the grid is empty (both `n` and `m` are 0), the function returns 0.
- If the grid contains only one row or one column, the function will not update the auxiliary tables for cells that do not have the required neighbors, and the score will be based on the initial values of these tables (which are typically initialized to 0).

Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that the `create_table()` function initializes the auxiliary tables correctly. If `create_table()` does not initialize the tables properly, the function's behavior could be incorrect.
- The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., if `func_2()` returns invalid dimensions or if the input strings are not of the correct length). This could lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def create_table():
    return [[1 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `create_table` is intended to accept two parameters `m` and `n`, both positive integers, and return a list of lists where each inner list contains `m` elements set to 1, and there are `n` such inner lists. However, the function as written does not actually accept any parameters, which means it will result in a `NameError` when `m` and `n` are not defined in the global scope. If `m` and `n` are defined externally, the function will behave as described in the annotations. Therefore, the function should be modified to accept `m` and `n` as parameters to ensure it works correctly. After the function executes, assuming `m` and `n` are defined, it will return a 2D list (a list of lists) with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is 1.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
