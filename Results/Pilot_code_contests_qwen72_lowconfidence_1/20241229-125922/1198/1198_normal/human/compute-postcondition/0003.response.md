The code `table.append(input())` appends the user input to the list `table`. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, and `table` is an empty list. After executing the code, `table` will contain one element, which is the input provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing the user input**
