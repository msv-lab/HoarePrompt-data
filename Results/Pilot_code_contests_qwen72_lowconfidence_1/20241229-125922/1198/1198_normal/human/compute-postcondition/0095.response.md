To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.
- `j` is 1.
- The condition for updating `bottom_left[i][j]` is: if `i < n - 1` and `j > 0` and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`, then `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` must be incremented by 1 to become 2.
- All other states (`n`, `i`, `m`, `table`, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 2.**
