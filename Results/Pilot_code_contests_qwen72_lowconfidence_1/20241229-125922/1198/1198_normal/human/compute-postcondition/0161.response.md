The code initializes the variable `answer` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `table`, or `bottom_right`. Therefore, the output state includes the initial values of these variables, with the addition of `answer` being set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0), `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state, `answer` is 0**.
