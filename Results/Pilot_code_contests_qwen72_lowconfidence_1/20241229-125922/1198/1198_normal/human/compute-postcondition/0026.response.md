To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0)
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`
- `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `i` is 1
- `j` is `m`

Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(m)` will execute if `m` is greater than 0. This is because `range(m)` generates a sequence from 0 to `m-1`, and this sequence is non-empty only if `m` is greater than 0.

2. **Initial Value of `j`**: The variable `j` is initialized to `m` before the loop starts. However, within the loop, `j` will take values from 0 to `m-1`. Therefore, the initial value of `j` should be 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `table`, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`, and `i`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute. They are part of the program state but are not relevant to the loop's condition.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` must be greater than 0, `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
