Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 1. If `i < n - 1` and `j > 0` and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`, then `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, and the tables `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` remain unchanged.***
