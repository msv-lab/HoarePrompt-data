The code snippet modifies the value of `bottom_left[i][j]` by setting it to the minimum of `bottom_left[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_left[i][j - 1]`, and then adding 1 to the result. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated.
- The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
- The conditions `i < n - 1` and `j > 0` ensure that the indices used in the code are valid.
- The condition `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]` is still satisfied.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 0, `i < n - 1`, `j > 0`, `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`, `bottom_left[i][j] = min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`.**
