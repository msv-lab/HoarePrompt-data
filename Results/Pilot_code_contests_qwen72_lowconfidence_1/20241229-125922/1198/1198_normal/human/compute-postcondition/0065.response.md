The value of `top_right[i][j]` is updated to the minimum of `top_right[i - 1][j]` and `top_right[i][j + 1]` plus 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table as described, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `m - 1`, `table[i - 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, `top_right[i][j]` is `min(top_right[i - 1][j], top_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`**
