The code snippet updates the value of `answer` by adding the minimum value among `top_left[i][j]`, `top_right[i][j]`, `bottom_left[i][j]`, and `bottom_right[i][j]`. Given the initial state, let's determine the new state after executing this code.

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0)
- `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state
- `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` plus the minimum value of `top_left[1][0]`, `top_right[1][0]`, `bottom_left[1][0]`, and `bottom_right[1][0]`
- `j` is 1

Code Execution:
- The value of `answer` is updated by adding the minimum value of `top_left[1][1]`, `top_right[1][1]`, `bottom_left[1][1]`, and `bottom_right[1][1]`.

Output State:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0)
- `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state
- `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` plus the minimum value of `top_left[1][0]`, `top_right[1][0]`, `bottom_left[1][0]`, and `bottom_right[1][0]` plus the minimum value of `top_left[1][1]`, `top_right[1][1]`, `bottom_left[1][1]`, and `bottom_right[1][1]`
- `j` is 1

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0), `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state, `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` plus the minimum value of `top_left[1][0]`, `top_right[1][0]`, `bottom_left[1][0]`, and `bottom_right[1][0]` plus the minimum value of `top_left[1][1]`, `top_right[1][1]`, `bottom_left[1][1]`, and `bottom_right[1][1]`, `j` is 1**
