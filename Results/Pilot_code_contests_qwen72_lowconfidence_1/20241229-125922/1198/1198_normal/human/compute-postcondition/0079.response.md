To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

### Given For Loop:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `m` is at least 1
- `j` is `m - 1`
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs
- `top_left` is a table as described
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`
- If `i > 0`, `j < m - 1`, and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_right[2][m - 1]` is updated. Otherwise, all variables and conditions remain unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1.
2. **Current State of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `m - 1`.
3. **Next Value of `j`**: After decrementing `j` by 1, the new value of `j` will be `m - 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is now `m - 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `table`, `top_left`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `if i > 0`, `j < m - 1`, and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]` will be evaluated with the new value of `j`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m - 2`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table as described, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`. If `i > 0`, `j < m - 1`, and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_right[2][m - 1]` is updated. Otherwise, all variables and conditions remain unchanged.**
