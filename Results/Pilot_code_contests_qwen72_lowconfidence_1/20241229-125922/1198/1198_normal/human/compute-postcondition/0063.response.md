To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

### For Loop Analysis
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This loop iterates over the range starting from `m - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. For the loop to execute at least once, the following conditions must be met:
- `m - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0. This implies that `m` must be at least 1.

### Initial State Analysis
The initial state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `j` is 0.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` is a table as described.
- `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`.

### Adjustments Needed
To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state to guarantee that `m` is at least 1. The other variables do not directly affect the loop's execution, but their initial values should be noted for completeness.

### Final State
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table as described, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`**
