To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **State before the loop starts:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
   - `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
   - `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
   - `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.
   - `j` is `m - 1` after the loop finishes.

2. **For loop statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop `for j in range(m):` will execute if `m` is greater than 0. If `m` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run at all.

4. **Adjustments needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `j` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the loop.

5. **Other states:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (already given).
   - `i` is `n - 2` (already given).
   - `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs (already given).
   - `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table` (already given).
   - `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()` (already given).

Given these points, the adjusted state before the loop starts should ensure that `m` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 0**
