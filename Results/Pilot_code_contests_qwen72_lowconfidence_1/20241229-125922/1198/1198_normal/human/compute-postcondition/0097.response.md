Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 2. If `i < n - 1` and `j > 0` and the elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, then `bottom_left[n - 1][2]` is `bottom_left[n - 1][1] + 1`.***
