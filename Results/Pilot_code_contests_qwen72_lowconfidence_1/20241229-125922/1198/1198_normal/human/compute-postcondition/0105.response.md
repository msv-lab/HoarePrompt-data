The line of code modifies the element in the `bottom_left` table at position `[i][j]`. It sets this element to the minimum of the elements at positions `[i + 1][j]` and `[i][j - 1]` in the same table, plus 1. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `j` is 1.
- `m` is greater than 0, and since `j` is 1, the condition `j < m` is true, meaning the loop will execute again.

The value of `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to be `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`. Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` is `n - 1`. For `j`, which is 1, `j - 1` is 0.

Therefore, the new value of `bottom_left[n - 2][1]` is `min(bottom_left[n - 1][1], bottom_left[n - 2][0]) + 1`.

The output state includes all the information from the initial state that remains unchanged, with the specific update to `bottom_left[n - 2][1]`:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 1, the loop will execute again if `j < m`, `bottom_left[n - 2][1]` is `min(bottom_left[n - 1][1], bottom_left[n - 2][0]) + 1`.**
