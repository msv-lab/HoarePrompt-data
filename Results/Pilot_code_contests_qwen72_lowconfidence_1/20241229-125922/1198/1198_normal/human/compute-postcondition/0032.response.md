Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` must be greater than 1, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` are values returned by `create_table()`. If `i > 0` and `j > 0` and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_left[1][1]` is updated to `min(top_left[0][1], top_left[1][0]) + 1`. Otherwise, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` remain unchanged. `i` is 1, `j` is 1.***
