To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` are values returned by `create_table()`.
- If `i > 0` and `j > 0` and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_left[1][1]` is updated to `min(top_left[0][1], top_left[1][0]) + 1`. Otherwise, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` remain unchanged.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 1.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop iterates over the range `range(m)`.
2. The current value of `j` is 1.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `m`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Since `m` must be greater than 1, and `j` is currently 1, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Updated State:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` are values returned by `create_table()`.
- If `i > 0` and `j > 0` and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_left[1][1]` is updated to `min(top_left[0][1], top_left[1][0]) + 1`. Otherwise, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` remain unchanged.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` must be greater than 2, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` are values returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**.
