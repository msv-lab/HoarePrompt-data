To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`
- `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0)
- `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state
- `answer` is 0

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. This is because `range(m)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `m-1`, and this sequence will be non-empty only if `m > 0`.

2. **Initial State of `j`**: Before the loop starts, `j` will be initialized to 0.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `i`, `table`, `bottom_right`, and `answer`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they should be consistent with the given state.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (this is already given and does not need adjustment).
- `i` is 0 (this is already given and does not need adjustment).
- `m` must be greater than 0 (this ensures the loop will execute at least once).
- `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0) (this is already given and does not need adjustment).
- `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state (this is already given and does not need adjustment).
- `answer` is 0 (this is already given and does not need adjustment).
- `j` is 0 (this is the initial state for the loop variable).

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0), `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state, `answer` is 0, `j` is 0**
