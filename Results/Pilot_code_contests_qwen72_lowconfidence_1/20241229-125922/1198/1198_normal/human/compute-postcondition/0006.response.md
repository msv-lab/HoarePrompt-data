To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` (the loop variable) is within the range of `n`. This means `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

2. **State Variables**:
   - `n`: This variable controls the number of iterations. It remains greater than 0.
   - `m`: This variable is the second value returned by `func_2()`. It does not change with each iteration.
   - `table`: This list is modified in each iteration by appending a new user input.

3. **Iteration Impact**:
   - After each iteration, `table` gains one additional user input.
   - `n` is not directly modified in the loop, but it controls the number of iterations. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again.

Given these points, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
- `m` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
- `table` will contain one more user input after the current iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing the user input and one additional user input**.
