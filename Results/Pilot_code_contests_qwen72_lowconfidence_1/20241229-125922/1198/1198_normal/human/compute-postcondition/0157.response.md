The given code snippet updates the value of `bottom_right[i][j]` based on certain conditions. According to the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `j` is `0`.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The condition for updating `bottom_right[i][j]` is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`, `j` must be less than `m - 1`, and the elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` must all be equal.

Given these conditions, let's evaluate the code step by step:

1. **Check the conditions:**
   - `i` is `n - 3`, which is less than `n - 1` because `n` is greater than 1.
   - `j` is `0`, which is less than `m - 1` because `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - The elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` must all be equal for the update to occur.

2. **If the conditions are met:**
   - `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`.

3. **If the conditions are not met:**
   - The state remains unchanged.

Since the conditions are met (assuming the table elements are equal), the value of `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `0`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `bottom_right[i][j]` is `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`**.
