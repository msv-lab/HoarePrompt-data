The code snippet updates the value at `bottom_left[i][j]` by calculating the minimum of `bottom_left[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_left[i][j - 1]`, and then adding 1 to this minimum value. Here's the detailed impact:

- The value of `i` is `n - 1`.
- The value of `j` is 2.
- The new value of `bottom_left[i][j]` is calculated as `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`.

Since `i` is `n - 1`, the calculation involves accessing `bottom_left[n][2]` and `bottom_left[n - 1][1]`. However, because `i` is the last index in the `bottom_left` table, `bottom_left[n][2]` is out of bounds and would typically cause an error. For the purpose of this simulation, we assume that the code does not handle out-of-bounds errors, and thus the calculation is based on the valid part of the array.

Therefore, the new value of `bottom_left[n - 1][2]` is `min(bottom_left[n - 1][1], bottom_left[n - 1][1]) + 1`, which simplifies to `bottom_left[n - 1][1] + 1`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 2, `bottom_left[n - 1][2]` is `bottom_left[n - 1][1] + 1`.**
