To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(m):` will execute if `m` is greater than 0. If `m` is 0 or less, the loop will not run.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
   - `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0).
   - `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state.
   - `answer` is calculated based on the minimum values of `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right`.
   - `j` is `m-1`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0. This is because the loop iterates over `range(m)`, and if `m` is 0 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not run.
   - The variable `j` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, not `m-1`, to ensure the loop starts correctly.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `m` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0.

**Adjusted State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0), `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state, `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` plus the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[1][j]`, `top_right[1][j]`, `bottom_left[1][j]`, and `bottom_right[1][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `j` is 0**
