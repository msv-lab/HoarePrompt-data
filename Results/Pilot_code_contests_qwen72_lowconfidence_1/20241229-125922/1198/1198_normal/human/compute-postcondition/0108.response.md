The code snippet updates the value of `bottom_left[i][j]` based on the minimum of `bottom_left[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_left[i][j - 1]`, adding 1 to this minimum value.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `m` is greater than 0
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`
- `j` is 2
- The loop will execute again if `j < m`

The condition `if i < n - 1 and j > 0 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]` is assumed to be true for this execution.

The code snippet:
```python
bottom_left[i][j] = min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1
```

Impact:
- `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to the minimum of `bottom_left[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_left[i][j - 1]`, plus 1.

Since `i` is `n - 2` and `j` is 2, the specific indices being updated are `bottom_left[n - 2][2]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `m` is greater than 0
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`
- `j` is 2
- The loop will execute again if `j < m`
- `bottom_left[n - 2][2]` is set to `min(bottom_left[n - 1][2], bottom_left[n - 2][1]) + 1`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 2, the loop will execute again if `j < m`, `bottom_left[n - 2][2]` is set to `min(bottom_left[n - 1][2], bottom_left[n - 2][1]) + 1`**
