To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` is greater than 1.
  - `i` is `n - 2`.
  - `j` is `m - 1`.
  - `m` is greater than 0.
  - `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged for all `i` and `j`.
  - If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `j` is less than `m - 1` and the values `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, then `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `m - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`.

2. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `m - 1`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `m - 2`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The values of `n`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged.
   - The condition for updating `bottom_right[i][j]` depends on the values of `i` and `j` and the elements in the `table` and `bottom_right` arrays. Since the loop only changes `j`, the conditions involving `i` and `j` will be re-evaluated with the new value of `j`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is `m - 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, and `bottom_right[i][j]`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged for all `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `j` is less than `m - 1` and the values `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, then `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged.**
