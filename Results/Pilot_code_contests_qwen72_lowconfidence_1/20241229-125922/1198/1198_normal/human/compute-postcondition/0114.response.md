The code updates the value of `bottom_left[i][j]` by setting it to the minimum of `bottom_left[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_left[i][j - 1]` plus 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`
- `j` is 0
- `i` is less than `n - 1`
- `j` is greater than 0
- The elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to the minimum of `bottom_left[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_left[i][j - 1]` plus 1.
2. Since `j` is 0, `bottom_left[i][j - 1]` is out of bounds (since `j - 1` would be -1), but this is not an issue because the code will only access valid indices.
3. The value of `bottom_left[i][j]` will be the minimum of `bottom_left[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_left[i][j - 1]` plus 1.

The updated state is:
- `bottom_left[i][j]` is now `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 0, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is greater than 0, the elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, `bottom_left[i][j]` is `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`.**
