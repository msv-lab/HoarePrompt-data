To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` is greater than 1.
  - `i` is `n - 3`.
  - `j` is `-1`.
  - `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
  - If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `j` is less than `m - 1` and the elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, then `bottom_right[i][j]` is set to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` in reverse order, starting from `m - 1` down to `0`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `-1`, which means the loop has just finished its first iteration where `j` was `0`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Determine the next value of `j`:**
   - Since the loop decrements `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.

2. **Check the loop condition:**
   - The loop condition is `j >= -1`. Since `j` is currently `-1`, the loop will not execute another iteration because the next value of `j` would be `-2`, which does not satisfy the condition `j >= -1`.

3. **Adjust the state:**
   - Since the loop will not execute another iteration, the state remains unchanged.

### Final State:
The state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop will not execute another iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `j` is less than `m - 1` and the elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, then `bottom_right[i][j]` is set to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
