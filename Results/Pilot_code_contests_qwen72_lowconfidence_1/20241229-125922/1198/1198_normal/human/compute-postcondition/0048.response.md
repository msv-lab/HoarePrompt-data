Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` is a positive integer, `top_left` is a table where for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i > 0 and j > 0 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`; otherwise, `top_left[i][j]` remains unchanged. `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` are the values returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 2, `j` is `m`.**
