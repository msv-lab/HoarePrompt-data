The code assigns the value returned by the function `create_table()` to the variable `bottom_right`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs (if `n` is 0, `table` remains an empty list), `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`**
