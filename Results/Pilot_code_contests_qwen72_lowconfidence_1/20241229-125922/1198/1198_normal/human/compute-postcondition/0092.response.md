To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.
- `j` is 0.
- If `i < n - 1` and `j > 0` and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`, then `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, and the tables `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m - 1`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than `m`.

### Updated State:
- `j` is incremented to 1.
- The condition `j < m` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 1. If `i < n - 1` and `j > 0` and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`, then `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, and the tables `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` remain unchanged.**
