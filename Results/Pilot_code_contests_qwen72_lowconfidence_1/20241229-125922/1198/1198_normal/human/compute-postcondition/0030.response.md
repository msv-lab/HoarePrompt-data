To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(m):` will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
   - `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
   - `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
   - `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
   - `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 0.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop increments `j` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`.

Given that `j` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 1, and `m` must be greater than 1.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `j` is incremented from 0 to 1.
   - `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` must be greater than 1, `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**.
