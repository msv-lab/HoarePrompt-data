To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop iterates over the range from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`. For this loop to execute at least once, the following conditions must be met:
- `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs (or remains an empty list if `n` is 0).
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, the loop variable `i` starts at `n - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0. Therefore, `i` should be initialized to `n - 1`.

The state after adjustments should be:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is initialized to `n - 1`.

Since the other variables (`m`, `table`, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
