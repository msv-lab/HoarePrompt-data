The code updates the value of `bottom_right[i][j]` by taking the minimum of `bottom_right[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_right[i][j + 1]` and adding 1 to it.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `m` is greater than 0
- `j` is `m - 1`
- `i` is less than `n - 1`
- `j` is less than `m - 1`
- `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal

We need to determine the new value of `bottom_right[i][j]`.

Since `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is `m - 1`, the indices `i + 1` and `j + 1` would be out of bounds. However, the precondition states that `i` is less than `n - 1` and `j` is less than `m - 1`, so `i + 1` and `j + 1` are valid indices.

The code sets `bottom_right[i][j]` to the minimum of `bottom_right[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_right[i][j + 1]` plus 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `m` is greater than 0
- `j` is `m - 1`
- `i` is less than `n - 1`
- `j` is less than `m - 1`
- `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal
- `bottom_right[i][j]` is `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m - 1`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is less than `m - 1`, `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, `bottom_right[i][j]` is `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`**
