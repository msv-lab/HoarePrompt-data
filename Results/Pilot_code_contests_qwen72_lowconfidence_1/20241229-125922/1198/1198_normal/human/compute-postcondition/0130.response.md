The code snippet updates the value of `bottom_right[i][j]` based on the minimum of the adjacent elements in the matrix `bottom_right` plus 1. Hereâ€™s the detailed impact:

- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is `m - 2`
- The new value of `bottom_right[i][j]` is the minimum of `bottom_right[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_right[i][j + 1]` plus 1.

Since `i` and `j` are already defined in terms of `n` and `m`, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is the value of `bottom_right[i][j]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m - 2`, `bottom_right[n - 1][m - 2]` is `min(bottom_right[n][m - 2], bottom_right[n - 1][m - 1]) + 1`**
