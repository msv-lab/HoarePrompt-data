The provided Python code updates the value of `bottom_right[i][j]` based on the minimum of its adjacent cells in the `bottom_right` matrix plus one. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program state.

- The value of `i` is `n - 2`, and the value of `j` is `m - 2`.
- The condition for updating `bottom_right[i][j]` is that `i` is less than `n - 1` and `j` is less than `m - 1`, and the values `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal.

Given the initial conditions, `i` is indeed less than `n - 1` (since `i = n - 2` and `n > 1`), and `j` is less than `m - 1` (since `j = m - 2` and `m > 0`). Therefore, the condition for updating `bottom_right[i][j]` can potentially be met.

If the condition is met, `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `bottom_right[i][j]` is `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1` if `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, otherwise `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged.**
