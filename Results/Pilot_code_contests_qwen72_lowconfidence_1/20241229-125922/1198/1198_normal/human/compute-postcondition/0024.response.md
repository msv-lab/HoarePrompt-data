Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 0, `j` is `m`. For each `j` from 1 to `m-1`, if `i` > 0 and `j` > 0 and the values at `table[i - 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, then `top_left[i][j]` is `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` remain unchanged.**
