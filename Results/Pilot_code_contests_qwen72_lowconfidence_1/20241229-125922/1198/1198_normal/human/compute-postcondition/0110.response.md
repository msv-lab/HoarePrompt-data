To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the provided code and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.
- `j` is `m - 1` after the loop finishes.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for j in range(m):
    if i < n - 1 and j > 0 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]:
        bottom_left[i][j] = min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates `m` times, where `j` ranges from 0 to `m - 1`.
   - For each iteration, the condition `i < n - 1 and j > 0 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]` must be true for the update to occur.

2. **State After Each Iteration**:
   - After the loop finishes, `j` will be `m - 1`.
   - If the condition is met during any iteration, `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`.

3. **Final State**:
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` remains `n - 2`.
   - `m` remains the second value returned by `func_2()`.
   - `table` remains a list containing `n` user inputs.
   - `top_left` and `top_right` remain tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
   - `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain initialized by `create_table()`.
   - `j` is `m - 1`.

4. **Changes to `bottom_left`**:
   - For each valid `j` (where `j > 0` and the elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are equal), `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated.
   - If the condition is never met, `bottom_left` remains unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is `m - 1`. If the condition `i < n - 1 and j > 0 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]` is met for any `j` in the range 1 to `m - 1`, `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, `bottom_left` remains unchanged.**
