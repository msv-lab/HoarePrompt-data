Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs (or remains an empty list if `n` is 0). `top_left` is a table where for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i > 0 and j > 0 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`; otherwise, `top_left[i][j]` remains unchanged. `top_right` is a table where for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i > 0 and j < m - 1 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_right[i - 1][j], top_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`; otherwise, `top_right[i][j]` remains unchanged. `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`.**
