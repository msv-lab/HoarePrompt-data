To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.
- `j` is `m - 1` after the loop finishes.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be `n - 2` at the start of the next iteration.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `table`, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`, and `j`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the loop control structure.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is `m - 1` after the loop finishes.**
