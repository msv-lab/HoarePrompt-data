The value of `top_left[i][j]` is updated to the minimum of `top_left[i - 1][j]` and `top_left[i][j - 1]` plus 1. Since `i` and `j` are both greater than 0, the indices used for accessing `top_left` are valid. The elements `table[i - 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, but this does not affect the calculation of `top_left[i][j]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` must be greater than 0, `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `top_left[i][j]` is `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`, and the elements `table[i - 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal.**
