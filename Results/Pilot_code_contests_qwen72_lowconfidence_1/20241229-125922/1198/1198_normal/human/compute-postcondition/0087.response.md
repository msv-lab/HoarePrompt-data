To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs (or remains an empty list if `n` is 0).
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`. This implies that `n` must be greater than `0`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `n` is greater than `0` for the loop to execute.
- The variable `i` should start at `n - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`**.
