Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `0`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `j` is less than `m - 1` and the elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, then `bottom_right[i][j]` is set to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
