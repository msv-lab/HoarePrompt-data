The code updates the value of `bottom_right[i][j]` by setting it to the minimum of `bottom_right[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_right[i][j + 1]` plus 1. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, as does the condition that `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `bottom_right[i][j]` is now `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is less than `m - 1`, and the values `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal.**
