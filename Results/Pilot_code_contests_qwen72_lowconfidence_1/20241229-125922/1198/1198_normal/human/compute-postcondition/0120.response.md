The code updates the value of `bottom_left[i][j]` based on the minimum value between `bottom_left[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_left[i][j - 1]`, then adds 1 to that minimum value.

Given:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `j` is 2
- `bottom_left` is a table (list of lists) initialized by `create_table()`

The code modifies `bottom_left[i][j]` to be the minimum of `bottom_left[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_left[i][j - 1]` plus 1.

Let's break down the changes:
- `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 1, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` is a list of lists where `bottom_left[n - 3][2]` is updated to `min(bottom_left[n - 2][2], bottom_left[n - 3][1]) + 1`, `bottom_right` is initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 2**.
