The given Python code snippet modifies the `bottom_right[i][j]` element based on the conditions provided in the initial state. Let's analyze this step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `j` is `-1`.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - The conditions for updating `bottom_right[i][j]` are:
     - `i` is less than `n - 1`.
     - `j` is less than `m - 1`.
     - The elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal.

2. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - `i` is `n - 3`, which is less than `n - 1` (since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 3` is less than `n - 1`).
   - `j` is `-1`, which is less than `m - 1` (since `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `m - 1` is non-negative, and `-1` is less than any non-negative number).
   - The elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal (this condition is assumed to be true as per the initial state).

3. **Updating `bottom_right[i][j]`:**
   - The code sets `bottom_right[i][j]` to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`.

4. **Final State:**
   - The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged.
   - The value of `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `bottom_right[i][j]` is `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`**.
