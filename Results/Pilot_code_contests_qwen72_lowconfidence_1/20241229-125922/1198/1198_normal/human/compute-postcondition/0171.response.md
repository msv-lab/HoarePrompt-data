To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information:

1. **State before the loop starts:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`
   - `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0)
   - `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state
   - `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`
   - `j` is `m-1`

2. **For loop statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop `for j in range(m):` will execute if `m` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `j` will start at 0 and iterate up to `m-1`.

4. **Adjustments needed:**
   - `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `j` should be 0, not `m-1`.

5. **Final state:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0)
   - `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state
   - `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`
   - `j` is 0

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0), `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state, `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `j` is 0**
