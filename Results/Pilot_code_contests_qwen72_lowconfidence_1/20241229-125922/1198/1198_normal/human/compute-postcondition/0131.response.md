Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m - 2`. If `i < n - 1` and `j < m - 1` and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `bottom_right[n - 1][m - 2]` is set to `min(bottom_right[n][m - 2], bottom_right[n - 1][m - 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged and `bottom_right[i][j]` is not modified.***
