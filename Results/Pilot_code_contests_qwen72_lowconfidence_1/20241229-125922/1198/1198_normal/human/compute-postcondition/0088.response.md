To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the conditions that must be met for the loop to start and continue executing. Specifically, we need to ensure that the range `m` is valid and that the initial values of the variables involved are set correctly.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`

The for loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Range Condition (`m`)**:
   - The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. If `m` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
   - Therefore, `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

2. **Initial Value of `j`**:
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `m - 1`.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`n`, `i`, `table`, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition. However, they must be in a valid state for the loop to be meaningful.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `m` is greater than 0. The other variables should remain as they are, but their validity should be noted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 0**
