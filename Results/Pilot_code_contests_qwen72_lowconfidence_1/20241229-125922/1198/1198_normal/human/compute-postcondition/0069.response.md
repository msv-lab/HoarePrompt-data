Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table as described, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`. If `i` > 0 and `j` < `m - 1` and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_right[1][0]` is `min(top_right[0][0], top_right[1][1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
