The given code updates the value of `bottom_left[i][j]` by taking the minimum of `bottom_left[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_left[i][j - 1]`, and then adding 1 to that minimum value.

Let's break down the changes:

- `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `table`, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`, and `j` remain unchanged except for the specific element `bottom_left[i][j]` which is updated.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is greater than 0, the elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, `bottom_left[i][j]` is `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`.**
