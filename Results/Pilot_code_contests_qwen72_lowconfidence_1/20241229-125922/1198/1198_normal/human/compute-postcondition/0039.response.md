Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` is a positive integer, `top_left` is a table where for each `j` in the range `[1, m-1]`, if `table[0][j] == table[1][j-1] == table[1][j]`, then `top_left[1][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[0][j], top_left[1][j-1]) + 1`, otherwise `top_left[1][j]` remains unchanged, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and the condition `(i > 0 and j > 0 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]))` holds true.***
