To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the provided code and the conditions under which the loop operates.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    if i < n - 1 and j < m - 1 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]:
        bottom_right[i][j] = min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `m - 1` down to `0`.
   - For each iteration, the condition `if i < n - 1 and j < m - 1 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`.

2. **Variable Changes**:
   - `i` remains constant at `n - 1` throughout the loop.
   - `j` decreases from `m - 1` to `0`.

3. **Condition Impact**:
   - The condition `i < n - 1` is always false because `i` is `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, the inner if-statement will never be true, and `bottom_right[i][j]` will never be updated.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `i` remains `n - 1`.
   - `j` will be `-1` (since the loop stops when `j` reaches `-1`).
   - `bottom_right[i][j]` will not be modified because the condition is never met.

### Output State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `j` is `-1`.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged for all `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged for all `i` and `j`.**
