Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` must be greater than 0, `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `i` > 0 and `j` > 0 and the values at `table[i - 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, an `IndexError` is raised.***
