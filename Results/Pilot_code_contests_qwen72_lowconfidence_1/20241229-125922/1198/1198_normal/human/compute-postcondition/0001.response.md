The function `create_table` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition, but based on the context, it should accept two parameters `m` and `n`. `m` and `n` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table to be created. The function returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains `m` elements, all set to 1, and there are `n` such inner lists.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `m` and `n`, both positive integers, and returns a list of lists where each inner list contains `m` elements set to 1, and there are `n` such inner lists.**
