To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the provided loop code and the conditions under which the loop operates.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(m):
    if i < n - 1 and j > 0 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]:
        bottom_left[i][j] = min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs `m` times, where `m` is a positive integer (since the loop executes at least once if `m` is greater than 0).
2. **Inner Condition**:
   - `i < n - 1`: This condition is always false because `i` is initially set to `n - 1`.
   - `j > 0`: This condition is true for all iterations except the first (when `j` is 0).
   - `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`: This condition checks if the elements in the `table` are equal.

Since `i < n - 1` is always false, the inner condition will never be met, and the body of the if statement will never execute.

### Output State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.
- `j` is `m - 1` after the loop finishes.

Since the inner condition is never met, the values of `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is `m - 1` after the loop finishes.**
