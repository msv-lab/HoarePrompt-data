Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` must be greater than 0, `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 0. If `i` > 0 and `j` > 0 and the value at `table[i - 1][j]` is equal to the value at `table[i][j - 1]` and is also equal to the value at `table[i][j]`, then `top_left[i][j]` is `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
