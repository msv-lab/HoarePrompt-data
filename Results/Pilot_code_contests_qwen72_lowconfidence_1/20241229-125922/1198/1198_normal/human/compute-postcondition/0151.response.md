The code snippet updates the value of `bottom_right[i][j]` by setting it to the minimum of `bottom_right[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_right[i][j + 1]`, plus 1.

- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `j` is `-1`.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The current value of `i` is less than `n - 1`.
- The current value of `j` is less than `m - 1`.
- The elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal.

After executing the code:
- `bottom_right[i][j]` is set to the minimum of `bottom_right[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_right[i][j + 1]`, plus 1.

The rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `-1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1`, the current value of `j` is less than `m - 1`, the elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, `bottom_right[i][j]` is `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`.**
