To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0).
- `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state.
- `answer` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the loop will not run at all.
2. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`m`, `table`, `bottom_right`, `answer`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, but they should be in a consistent state.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop. The other variables can remain as they are, but their values should be consistent with the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0), `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state, `answer` is 0**
