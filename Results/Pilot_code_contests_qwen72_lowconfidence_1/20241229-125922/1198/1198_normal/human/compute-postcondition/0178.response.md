To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`
- `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0)
- `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state
- `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` plus the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[1][j]`, `top_right[1][j]`, `bottom_left[1][j]`, and `bottom_right[1][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`
- `j` is `m-1`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

The other variables (`m`, `table`, `bottom_right`, `answer`, `j`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the increment of `i` or the condition of the for loop.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0), `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state, `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` plus the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[1][j]`, `top_right[1][j]`, `bottom_left[1][j]`, and `bottom_right[1][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `j` is `m-1`**
