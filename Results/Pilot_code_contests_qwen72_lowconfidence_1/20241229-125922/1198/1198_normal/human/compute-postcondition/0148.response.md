To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `j` is `-1`
- `m` is greater than 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: After the previous iteration, `i` will be `n - 3` (since it is decremented by 1).

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure that `i` can be `n - 3` and still be non-negative.
- `j` remains `-1` (as it is not modified by the loop condition).
- `m` remains greater than 0 (as it is not modified by the loop condition).

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `-1`, `m` is greater than 0**
