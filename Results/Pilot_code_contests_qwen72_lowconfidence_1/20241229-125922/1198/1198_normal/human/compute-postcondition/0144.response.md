According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m - 2` and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `m - 3`. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `m` must be at least 3 (since `j` starts at `m - 1` and needs to go down to 0).

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 3`, `m` is greater than 2**
