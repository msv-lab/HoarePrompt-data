Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m - 1`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table as described, `top_right` is updated for each `j` from `m - 1` down to 0 if the condition `i > 0`, `j < m - 1`, and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]` is met, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`. Additionally, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `m - 1`, and `table[i - 1][j]` is equal to `table[i][j + 1]` which is also equal to `table[i][j]`.**
