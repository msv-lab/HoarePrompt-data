To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `j` is `-1`
- `m` is greater than 0
- `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged for all `i` and `j`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over `j` from `m - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of `j` (which is `m - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the stopping value (`-1`). This means `m - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`, which simplifies to `m` being greater than `0`.

### Current State:
- `m` is already stated to be greater than 0, so the loop condition is satisfied.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `j` is initialized to `-1` in the given state, but within the loop, `j` will start at `m - 1`. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `m - 1` for the loop to start correctly.
- The variable `i` is set to `n - 2`, but this does not affect the loop's execution directly. However, it should be noted as part of the state.
- The variable `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged for all `i` and `j`, which is a condition that should be maintained.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged for all `i` and `j`**
