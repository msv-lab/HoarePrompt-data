The code snippet updates the `answer` variable by adding the minimum value among `top_left[i][j]`, `top_right[i][j]`, `bottom_left[i][j]`, and `bottom_right[i][j]`. Given the initial state, let's determine the new state:

- `n` must be greater than 1 (unchanged)
- `i` is 1 (unchanged)
- `m` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0) (unchanged)
- `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state (unchanged)
- `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` (updated)
- `j` is 0 (unchanged)

The code snippet updates `answer` by adding the minimum value among `top_left[1][0]`, `top_right[1][0]`, `bottom_left[1][0]`, and `bottom_right[1][0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0), `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state, `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` plus the minimum value of `top_left[1][0]`, `top_right[1][0]`, `bottom_left[1][0]`, and `bottom_right[1][0]`, `j` is 0**.
