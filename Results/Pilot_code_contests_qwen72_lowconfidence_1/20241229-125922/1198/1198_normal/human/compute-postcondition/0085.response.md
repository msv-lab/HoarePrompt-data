Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is -1, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table as described, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`. For each `j` from `m - 1` down to 0, if `i > 0` and `j < m - 1` and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_right[2][j]` is updated to `min(top_right[1][j], top_right[2][j + 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, `top_right[2][j]` remains unchanged.**
