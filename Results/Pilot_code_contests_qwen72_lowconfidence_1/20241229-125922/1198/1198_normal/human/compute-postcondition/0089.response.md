Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 0, and the current values of `i` and `j` satisfy the conditions `i < n - 1`, `j > 0`, and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`.***
