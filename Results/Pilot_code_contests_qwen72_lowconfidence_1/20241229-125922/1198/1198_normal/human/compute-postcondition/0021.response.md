To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 1.
- If `i` > 0 and `j` > 0 and the values at `table[i - 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, an `IndexError` is raised.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Additionally, `m` must be greater than 1 to ensure that the loop can execute again.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- `m` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop continues.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` must be greater than 1, `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `i` > 0 and `j` > 0 and the values at `table[i - 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, an `IndexError` is raised.**
