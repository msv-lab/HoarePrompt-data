To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `j` is 0.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` is a table where for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i > 0 and j > 0 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`; otherwise, `top_left[i][j]` remains unchanged.
- `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`. For each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i > 0 and j < m - 1 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_right[i][j]` is `min(top_right[i - 1][j], top_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`; otherwise, `top_right[i][j]` remains unchanged.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop iterates over the range `[0, n-1]`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- Since the loop condition is `i < n`, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `j` is 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table as described, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`**.
