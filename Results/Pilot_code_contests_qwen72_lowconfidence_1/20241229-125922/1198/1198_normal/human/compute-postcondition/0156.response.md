To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `j` is `-1`.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The loop condition is that `i` is less than `n - 1` and `j` is less than `m - 1`.
- The loop updates `j` from `m - 1` to `-1` (decrementing by 1).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `-1`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0` (since the range is from `m - 1` to `-1`).
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `0`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` must be `0` for the loop to execute one more time.
- All other conditions remain the same.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `0`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `j` is less than `m - 1` and the elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, then `bottom_right[i][j]` is set to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
