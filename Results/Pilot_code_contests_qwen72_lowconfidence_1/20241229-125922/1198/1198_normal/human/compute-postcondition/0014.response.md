To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the conditions that must be met for the `for` loop to run at least once. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute, the variable `m` must be greater than 0. This is because the `range(m)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `m-1`, and if `m` is 0 or negative, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0)
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`
- `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `i` is 0

The only state that directly affects the execution of the loop is `m`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `m` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` must be greater than 0, `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 0**
