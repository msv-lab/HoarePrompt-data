Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` must be greater than 2, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` are values returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `i > 0` and `j > 0` and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_left[1][2]` is set to `min(top_left[0][2], top_left[1][1]) + 1`.***
