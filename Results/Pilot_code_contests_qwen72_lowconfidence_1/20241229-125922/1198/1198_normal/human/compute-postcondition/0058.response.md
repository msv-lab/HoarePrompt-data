To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is `m - 2`.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` is a table where for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i > 0 and j > 0 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`; otherwise, `top_left[i][j]` remains unchanged.
- `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`. If `i > 0 and j < m - 1 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_right[i][j]` is `min(top_right[i - 1][j], top_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `m - 1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order.
2. **Current State**:
   - `j` is `m - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Decrement `j`**: Since the loop is decrementing `j` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `m - 3`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `m` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is now `m - 3`.
- `table` remains a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` remains the same as described.
- `top_right` remains the same as described.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m - 3`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table where for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i > 0 and j > 0 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`; otherwise, `top_left[i][j]` remains unchanged, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`. If `i > 0 and j < m - 1 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_right[i][j]` is `min(top_right[i - 1][j], top_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`.**
