Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 1, and the loop will execute again if `j < m`. If `i < n - 1` and `j > 0` and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`, then `bottom_left[n - 2][1]` is set to `min(bottom_left[n - 1][1], bottom_left[n - 2][0]) + 1`.***
