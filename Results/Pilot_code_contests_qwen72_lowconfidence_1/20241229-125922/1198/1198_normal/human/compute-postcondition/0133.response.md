The value at `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated to the minimum value between `bottom_right[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_right[i][j + 1]`, plus 1. The variables `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, but their relationships and constraints are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m - 3`, `bottom_right[i][j]` is `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`**
