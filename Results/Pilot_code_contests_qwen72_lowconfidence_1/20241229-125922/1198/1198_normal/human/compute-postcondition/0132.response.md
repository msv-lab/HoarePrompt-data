To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop structure:

### Given:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `m` is greater than 0
- `j` is `m - 2`
- The loop condition is `j in range(m - 1, -1, -1)`

### Loop Condition Analysis:
The loop iterates over `j` starting from `m - 1` down to 0 (inclusive). This means `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

### Current State:
- `j` is `m - 2`

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `m - 3`.

### State Adjustments:
- `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` becomes `m - 3`.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `m`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m - 3`**.
