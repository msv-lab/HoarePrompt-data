To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

Given state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1`

For loop statement:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `m - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
   - This means the loop will execute if `m - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`.

2. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `n` is greater than 0 (this does not directly affect the loop).
   - `i` is `n - 1` (this does not directly affect the loop).

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - For the loop to execute, `m - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`, which implies that `m` must be greater than `0`.
   - The variable `j` will start at `m - 1` and decrease to `0`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is greater than 0 (unchanged, as it does not affect the loop).
- `i` is `n - 1` (unchanged, as it does not affect the loop).
- `m` must be greater than 0 (to ensure the loop executes).
- `j` is `m - 1` (the initial value of `j` before the loop starts).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is `m - 1`**
