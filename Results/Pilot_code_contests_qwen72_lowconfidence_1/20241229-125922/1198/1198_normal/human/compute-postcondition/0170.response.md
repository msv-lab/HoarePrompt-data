To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
   - `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0).
   - `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state.
   - `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`.
   - `j` is `m-1`.

3. **Adjustments for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is 0, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, making `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` will be 1).

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0), `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state, `answer` is the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[0][j]`, `top_right[0][j]`, `bottom_left[0][j]`, and `bottom_right[0][j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `j` is `m-1`.**
