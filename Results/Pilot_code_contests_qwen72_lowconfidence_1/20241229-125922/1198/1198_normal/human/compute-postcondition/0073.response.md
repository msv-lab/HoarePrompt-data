To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop operates and the changes made during each iteration. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

### Initial State
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `j` is 0.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` is a table as described.
- `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`.

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    if i > 0 and j < m - 1 and table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]:
        top_right[i][j] = min(top_right[i - 1][j], top_right[i][j + 1]) + 1
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `m - 1` down to 0. This means the loop will execute `m` times, assuming `m` is at least 1.
2. **Inner Condition**: The inner condition checks if `i > 0`, `j < m - 1`, and the values `table[i - 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal. If this condition is met, `top_right[i][j]` is updated.
3. **Update Rule**: If the condition is met, `top_right[i][j]` is set to `min(top_right[i - 1][j], top_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`.

### Final Output State
- **`n`**: Remains a non-negative integer greater than 1.
- **`i`**: Remains 1.
- **`m`**: Must be at least 1 (since the loop iterates `m` times).
- **`j`**: After the loop, `j` will be -1 (since the loop ends when `j` is decremented to -1).
- **`table`**: Remains a list containing `n` user inputs.
- **`top_left`**: Remains a table as described.
- **`top_right`**: For each `j` from `m - 1` down to 0, if `i > 0`, `j < m - 1`, and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_right[i][j]` will be updated to `min(top_right[i - 1][j], top_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, `top_right[i][j]` remains unchanged.
- **`bottom_left` and `bottom_right`**: Remain as the values returned by `create_table()`.

### Summary
After the loop has finished executing, the state of the variables will be:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `m` is at least 1.
- `j` is -1.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` is a table as described.
- `top_right` is updated according to the loop condition for each `j` from `m - 1` down to 0.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is -1, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table as described, `top_right` is updated for each `j` from `m - 1` down to 0 if the condition `i > 0`, `j < m - 1`, and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]` is met, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`.**
