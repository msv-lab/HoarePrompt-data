To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `m`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(m):
    if i > 0 and j > 0 and table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]:
        top_left[i][j] = min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates `m` times, where `m` is a positive integer.
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if `i > 0`, `j > 0`, and the elements `table[i - 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal.
   - If the conditions are met, `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`.

2. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `j` will have iterated from 0 to `m-1`.
   - The value of `i` remains 1 throughout the loop.
   - The values of `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `top_left` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `top_left` is a table where, for each `j` in the range `[1, m-1]`, if `table[0][j] == table[1][j-1] == table[1][j]`, then `top_left[1][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[0][j], top_left[1][j-1]) + 1`. Otherwise, `top_left[1][j]` remains unchanged.
- `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` is a positive integer, `top_left` is a table where for each `j` in the range `[1, m-1]`, if `table[0][j] == table[1][j-1] == table[1][j]`, then `top_left[1][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[0][j], top_left[1][j-1]) + 1`, otherwise `top_left[1][j]` remains unchanged, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 1, `j` is `m`.**
