Output State: **The program returns the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[i][j]`, `top_right[i][j]`, `bottom_left[i][j]`, and `bottom_right[i][j]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1` and for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`. Here, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, and `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state.**
