To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1.
  - `i` is 2.
  - `m` is at least 1.
  - `j` is `m - 2`.
  - `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
  - `top_left` is a table as described.
  - `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`.
  - If `i > 0` and `j < m - 1` and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_right[2][m - 2]` is updated to `min(top_right[1][m - 2], top_right[2][m - 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, all variables and conditions remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `m - 1` to `0` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1 and still be within the range `[0, m - 1]`.

2. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `m - 2`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - To enter the next iteration, `j` must be decremented by 1, making `j = m - 3`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j >= 0`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m - 3` must be greater than or equal to 0, which implies `m >= 3`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` becomes `m - 3`.
- The condition `m >= 3` must hold for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 3, `j` is `m - 3`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table as described, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`. If `i > 0` and `j < m - 1` and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_right[2][m - 3]` is updated to `min(top_right[1][m - 3], top_right[2][m - 2]) + 1`. Otherwise, all variables and conditions remain unchanged.**
