To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for _ in range(n):` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
   - `table` is a list containing the user input.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. After each iteration, the loop variable `_` (which is not used in this case) is incremented, but the value of `n` itself does not change within the loop.
2. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `n` is the controlling variable for the loop, it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - The values of `m` and `table` are not directly affected by the loop iteration, so they remain the same.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0. The other variables (`m` and `table`) remain unchanged.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing the user input**
