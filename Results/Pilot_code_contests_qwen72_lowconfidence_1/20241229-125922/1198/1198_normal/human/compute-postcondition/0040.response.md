The value of `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, this means `top_left[2][0]` is updated to `min(top_left[1][0], top_left[2][-1]) + 1`. However, since `top_left[2][-1]` is out of bounds, we consider only `top_left[1][0]`.

Given the initial conditions, `top_left[1][0]` is already set, and `top_left[2][0]` will be updated based on this value. Since the condition `(i > 0 and j > 0 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]))` holds true, the update will proceed.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` is a positive integer, `top_left` is a table where for each `j` in the range `[1, m-1]`, if `table[0][j] == table[1][j-1] == table[1][j]`, then `top_left[1][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[0][j], top_left[1][j-1]) + 1`, otherwise `top_left[1][j]` remains unchanged, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `top_left[2][0]` is updated to `min(top_left[1][0], top_left[2][-1]) + 1` (considering only `top_left[1][0]` due to out-of-bounds access), and the condition `(i > 0 and j > 0 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]))` holds true.**
