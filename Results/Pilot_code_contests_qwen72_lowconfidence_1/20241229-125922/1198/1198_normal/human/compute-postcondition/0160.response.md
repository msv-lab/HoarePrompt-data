To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop executes and how the variables change through each iteration.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs (or remains an empty list if `n` is 0).
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < n - 1 and j < m - 1 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]:
            bottom_right[i][j] = min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The outer loop iterates over `i` from `n - 1` down to `0`.
   - The inner loop iterates over `j` from `m - 1` down to `0`.

2. **Update Condition:**
   - For each `i` and `j`, if `i < n - 1` and `j < m - 1` and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`.

3. **Final State:**
   - If `n` is 0 or `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `bottom_right` remains as initialized by `create_table()`.
   - If `n` and `m` are both greater than 0, the loop will execute for all `i` from `n - 1` to `0` and all `j` from `m - 1` to `0`.

### Output State:
- **If `n` is 0 or `m` is 0:**
  - `bottom_right` remains as initialized by `create_table()`.

- **If `n` and `m` are both greater than 0:**
  - For each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`:
    - If `i < n - 1` and `j < m - 1` and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `bottom_right[i][j]` is `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`.
    - Otherwise, `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged from its initial value.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0). `bottom_right` is updated such that for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i < n - 1` and `j < m - 1` and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `bottom_right[i][j]` is `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. If `n` is 0 or `m` is 0, `bottom_right` remains as initialized by `create_table()`.**
