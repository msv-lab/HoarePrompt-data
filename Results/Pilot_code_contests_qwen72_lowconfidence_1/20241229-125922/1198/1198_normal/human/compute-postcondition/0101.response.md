Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is greater than 0, and the elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal***.
