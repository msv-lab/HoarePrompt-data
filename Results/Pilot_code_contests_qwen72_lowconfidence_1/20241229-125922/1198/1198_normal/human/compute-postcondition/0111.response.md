To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- The condition `i < n - 1 and j > 0 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]` is checked for any `j` in the range 1 to `m - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `n - 1` to `0` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, so it will be `n - 3`.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be `n - 3`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `table`, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is `m - 1`.**
