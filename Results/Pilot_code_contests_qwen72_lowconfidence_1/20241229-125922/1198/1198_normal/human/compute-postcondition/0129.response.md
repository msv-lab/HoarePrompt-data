To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` is greater than 0
  - `i` is `n - 1`
  - `m` is greater than 0
  - `j` is `m - 1`
  - If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `j` is less than `m - 1` and `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j + 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, then `bottom_right[i][j]` is set to `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `m - 1` down to 0.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `m - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, so the new value of `j` should be `m - 2`.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` is decremented by 1, so it becomes `m - 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m - 2`**
