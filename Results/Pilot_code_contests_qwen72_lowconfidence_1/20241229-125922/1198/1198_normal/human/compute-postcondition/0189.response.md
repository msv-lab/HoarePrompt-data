Functionality: ** The function `func_3` processes a fabric represented by a grid of colors (a list of strings) and calculates a score based on the patterns of colors in the grid. Specifically, it initializes four auxiliary tables (`top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`) to store the sizes of square patterns found in the fabric. These tables are updated based on the following conditions:

1. For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid:
   - If `i > 0` and `j > 0` and the colors of the cells `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i, j)` are the same, `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i-1][j], top_left[i][j-1]) + 1`.
   - If `i > 0` and `j < m-1` and the colors of the cells `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j+1)`, and `(i, j)` are the same, `top_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_right[i-1][j], top_right[i][j+1]) + 1`.
   - If `i < n-1` and `j > 0` and the colors of the cells `(i+1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i, j)` are the same, `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_left[i+1][j], bottom_left[i][j-1]) + 1`.
   - If `i < n-1` and `j < m-1` and the colors of the cells `(i+1, j)`, `(i, j+1)`, and `(i, j)` are the same, `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_right[i+1][j], bottom_right[i][j+1]) + 1`.

2. After updating these tables, the function calculates the final score by summing the minimum values of `top_left[i][j]`, `top_right[i][j]`, `bottom_left[i][j]`, and `bottom_right[i][j]` for each cell `(i, j)` in the grid.

3. The function returns this score.

Edge Cases:
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 0 because there are no rows in the grid.
- If `m` is 0, the function also returns 0 because there are no columns in the grid.
- If the grid is empty (both `n` and `m` are 0), the function returns 0.
- If the grid contains only one row or one column, the function will not update the auxiliary tables for cells that do not have the required neighbors, and the score will be based on the initial values of these tables (which are typically initialized to 0).

Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that the `create_table()` function initializes the auxiliary tables correctly. If `create_table()` does not initialize the tables properly, the function's behavior could be incorrect.
- The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., if `func_2()` returns invalid dimensions or if the input strings are not of the correct length). This could lead to runtime errors or incorrect results. **
