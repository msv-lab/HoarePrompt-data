Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`. For each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i < n - 1` and `j > 0` and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]`, then `bottom_left[i][j]` is set to `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `m` is 0), then `bottom_left` remains as initialized by `create_table()`.**
