To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.
- `j` is `m - 1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0.
- The variable `j` is used as the loop counter and will start from 0 and go up to `m - 1`.

### Required Adjustments:
- **`m` must be greater than 0**: This is necessary for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`j` is 0**: At the start of the loop, `j` should be initialized to 0.

### Final State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.
- `j` is 0.

### State:
**`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 0**
