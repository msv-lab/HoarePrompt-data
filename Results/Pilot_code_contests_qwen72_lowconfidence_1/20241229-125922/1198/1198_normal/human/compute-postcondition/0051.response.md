To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the provided loop statement:

```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `m - 1` down to `0` (inclusive).
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `m - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `m - 1 >= 0`, which simplifies to `m >= 1`.

3. **Initial State of `j`:**
   - Before the loop starts, `j` should be initialized to `m - 1`.

### State Adjustments:
- **`m` must be greater than or equal to 1:** This ensures that the loop has at least one iteration.
- **`j` must be initialized to `m - 1:`** This is the starting point for the loop.

### Final State:
Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs
- `top_left` is a table with specific conditions
- `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m - 1`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table where for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i > 0 and j > 0 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`; otherwise, `top_left[i][j]` remains unchanged, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`**
