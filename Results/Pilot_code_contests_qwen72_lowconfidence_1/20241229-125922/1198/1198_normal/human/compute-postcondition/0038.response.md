To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute, the variable `m` must be a positive integer. This is because `range(m)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `m-1`, and if `m` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 1)
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs
- `m` is a positive integer
- `top_left` is a table where for each `j` in the range `[1, m-1]`, if `table[0][j] == table[1][j-1] == table[1][j]`, then `top_left[1][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[0][j], top_left[1][j-1]) + 1`, otherwise `top_left[1][j]` remains unchanged
- `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `m`

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `j` should be set to 0 before the loop starts, and `m` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 1), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` is a positive integer, `top_left` is a table where for each `j` in the range `[1, m-1]`, if `table[0][j] == table[1][j-1] == table[1][j]`, then `top_left[1][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[0][j], top_left[1][j-1]) + 1`, otherwise `top_left[1][j]` remains unchanged, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
