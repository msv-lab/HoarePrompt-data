To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues and how the state changes between iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` are values returned by `create_table()`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `m`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` remains the same (a positive integer greater than 0).
   - `table` remains the same (a list containing `n` user inputs).
   - `m` remains the same (the second value returned by `func_2()`).
   - `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- All other variables remain the same.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 1, `j` is `m`**.
