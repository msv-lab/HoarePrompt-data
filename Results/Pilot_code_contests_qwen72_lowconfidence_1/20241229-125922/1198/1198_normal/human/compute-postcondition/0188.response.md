The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided code snippet. However, given the context, it operates on a predefined set of parameters including `n` and `m`, which are positive integers representing the dimensions of a fabric, and `table`, a list of `n` strings each of length `m` consisting of lowercase English letters. The function computes the sum of the minimum values from four arrays (`top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right`) for each cell `[i][j]` in the fabric, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1` and `j` ranges from 0 to `m-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to compute and return the sum of the minimum values of `top_left[i][j]`, `top_right[i][j]`, `bottom_left[i][j]`, and `bottom_right[i][j]` for each cell in the fabric defined by the dimensions `n` and `m` and the color table `table`.
