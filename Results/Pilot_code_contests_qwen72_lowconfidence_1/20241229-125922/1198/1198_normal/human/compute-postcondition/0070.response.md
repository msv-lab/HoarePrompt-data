To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `m` must be at least 1.
- `j` is 0.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` is a table as described.
- `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`.
- If `i` > 0 and `j` < `m - 1` and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_right[1][0]` is `min(top_right[0][0], top_right[1][1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `m - 1` down to 0.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1 and still be within the valid range (i.e., `j` must be greater than or equal to 0).

### Adjustments Needed:
- `j` needs to be decremented by 1.
- Since `j` is currently 0, decrementing it will make `j` equal to -1, which is out of the valid range for the loop (0 to `m - 1`).

### Conclusion:
Since `j` is already 0 and the loop is decrementing `j` by 1, the next value of `j` would be -1, which is not within the valid range. Therefore, the loop will not execute one more time.

However, if we assume the loop should continue executing, we need to adjust `j` to the next valid value before the loop starts again.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is -1, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table as described, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`. If `i` > 0 and `j` < `m - 1` and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_right[1][0]` is `min(top_right[0][0], top_right[1][1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**

But since `j` being -1 means the loop will not execute, the correct interpretation is:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` is a table as described, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`. If `i` > 0 and `j` < `m - 1` and `table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `top_right[1][0]` is `min(top_right[0][0], top_right[1][1]) + 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**

This indicates that the loop will not execute one more time because `j` is already at its minimum valid value.
