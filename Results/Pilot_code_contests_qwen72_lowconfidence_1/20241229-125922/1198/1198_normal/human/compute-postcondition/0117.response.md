The given code updates the value of `bottom_left[i][j]` by calculating the minimum value between `bottom_left[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_left[i][j - 1]`, and then adding 1 to that minimum value.

- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `j` is 1.
- `bottom_left` is a table initialized by `create_table()`, which means it contains some initial values before this operation.

Given the initial state, the code updates `bottom_left[i][j]` to be the minimum of `bottom_left[i + 1][j]` (which is `bottom_left[n - 2][1]`) and `bottom_left[i][j - 1]` (which is `bottom_left[n - 3][0]`), plus 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 1, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 1, `bottom_left[n - 3][1]` is `min(bottom_left[n - 2][1], bottom_left[n - 3][0]) + 1`.**
