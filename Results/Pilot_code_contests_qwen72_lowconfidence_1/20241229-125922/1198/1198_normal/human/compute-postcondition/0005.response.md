The code `table.append(input())` appends a new user input to the list `table`. Since the initial state specifies that `table` is a list containing the user input, after this operation, `table` will contain one additional user input.

- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `m` remains the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `table` now contains an additional user input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing the user input and one additional user input**.
