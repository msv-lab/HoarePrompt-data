To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0).
- `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state.
- `answer` is the minimum of `top_left[0][0]`, `top_right[0][0]`, `bottom_left[0][0]`, and `bottom_right[0][0]`.
- `j` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `m`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
- Since `m` must be greater than 0, it remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0), `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state, `answer` is the minimum of `top_left[0][0]`, `top_right[0][0]`, `bottom_left[0][0]`, and `bottom_right[0][0]`, `j` is 1**
