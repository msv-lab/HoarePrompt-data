The code snippet `top_left = create_table()` introduces a new variable `top_left` which is assigned the value returned by the function `create_table()`. Since the details of `create_table()` are not provided, we assume it returns a value, which is then assigned to `top_left`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `table` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs (if `n` is 0, `table` remains an empty list), `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`**
