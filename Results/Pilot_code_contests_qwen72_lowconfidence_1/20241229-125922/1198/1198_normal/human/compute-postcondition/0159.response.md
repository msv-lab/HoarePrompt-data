To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop and the conditions under which it operates. Let's break down the loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `j` is `-1`.
- `m` is greater than 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    if i < n - 1 and j < m - 1 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]:
        bottom_right[i][j] = min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `m - 1` down to `0` (inclusive).
   - This means the loop will execute `m` times, decrementing `j` each time.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - For each iteration, the condition `if i < n - 1 and j < m - 1 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated.

3. **Variable Values After Loop Execution**:
   - `i` remains `n - 3` throughout the loop because it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `j` will be `0` after the last iteration of the loop.
   - `m` remains greater than 0, as it is not modified.
   - `bottom_right[i][j]` will be updated based on the condition for each `j` from `m - 1` down to `0`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `j` is `0`.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `bottom_right[i][j]` for each `j` from `0` to `m - 1` will be updated if the condition `i < n - 1 and j < m - 1 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]` is true. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `0`, `m` is greater than 0, `bottom_right[i][j]` for each `j` from `0` to `m - 1` is updated based on the condition `i < n - 1 and j < m - 1 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]` if true, otherwise remains unchanged.**
