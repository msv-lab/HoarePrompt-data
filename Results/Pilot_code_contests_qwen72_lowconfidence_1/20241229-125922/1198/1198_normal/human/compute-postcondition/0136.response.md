According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `-1`, `m` is greater than 0, and `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged for all `i` and `j`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`. The loop condition `i >= 0` must still be true for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that `i` is still non-negative after the decrement.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged for all `i` and `j`**
