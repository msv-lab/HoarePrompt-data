To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `j` is `-1`
- `m` is greater than 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Function**: The `range(m - 1, -1, -1)` function generates a sequence starting from `m - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. For this range to generate any values, the start value (`m - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the stop value (`-1`).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `m - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`.
   - This simplifies to `m - 1 >= 0`, which means `m >= 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`m` must be greater than or equal to 1**: This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

### Final State:
- `n` is greater than 1 (unchanged)
- `i` is `n - 3` (unchanged)
- `j` is `-1` (unchanged)
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 (adjusted)

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `-1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
