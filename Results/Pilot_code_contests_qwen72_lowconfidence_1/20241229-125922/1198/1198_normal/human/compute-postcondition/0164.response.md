The code snippet updates the value of `answer` by adding the minimum value among `top_left[i][j]`, `top_right[i][j]`, `bottom_left[i][j]`, and `bottom_right[i][j]`. The initial state indicates that `i` and `j` are both 0, so the specific elements being considered are `top_left[0][0]`, `top_right[0][0]`, `bottom_left[0][0]`, and `bottom_right[0][0]`.

Since the initial value of `answer` is 0, the new value of `answer` will be the minimum of these four elements.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `table` is a list of `n` user inputs (or an empty list if `n` is 0), `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state, `answer` is the minimum of `top_left[0][0]`, `top_right[0][0]`, `bottom_left[0][0]`, and `bottom_right[0][0]`, `j` is 0**
