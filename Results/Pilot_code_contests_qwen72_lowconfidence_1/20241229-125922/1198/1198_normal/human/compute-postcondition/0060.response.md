Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m - 3`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs. `top_left` is a table where for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i > 0 and j > 0 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`; otherwise, `top_left[i][j]` remains unchanged. `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`. If `i > 0 and j < m - 1 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_right[i][j]` is `min(top_right[i - 1][j], top_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` remain as the values returned by `create_table()`. If `i > 0 and j < m - 1 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j])`, `top_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_right[i - 1][j], top_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `top_right`.***
