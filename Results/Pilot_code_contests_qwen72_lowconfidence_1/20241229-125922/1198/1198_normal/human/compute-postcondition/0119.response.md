To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

### Current State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 1.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.
- `j` is 1.

### Loop Condition:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`.

### Analysis:
1. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

2. **Next Value of `j`:**
   - In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- The condition `j < m` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 1.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
- `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.
- `j` is 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 1, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 2**.
