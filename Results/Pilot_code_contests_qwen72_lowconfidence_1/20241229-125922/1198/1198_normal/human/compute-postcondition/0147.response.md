To analyze the output state of the given loop after all iterations, we need to consider the initial conditions and how the loop modifies the variables over time. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `j` is `-1`.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged for all `i` and `j`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    if i < n - 1 and j < m - 1 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]:
        bottom_right[i][j] = min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `m - 1` down to `0`.
   - For each `j`, the condition `if i < n - 1 and j < m - 1 and table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated.

2. **Variable Changes**:
   - `i` remains `n - 2` throughout the loop.
   - `j` decreases from `m - 1` to `0`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `i` will still be `n - 2`.
   - `j` will be `-1` (as it is the final value after the loop ends).
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
   - `bottom_right[i][j]` for each `j` from `0` to `m - 1` will be updated based on the condition, or remain unchanged if the condition is not met.

### Output State:
After all iterations of the loop, the final state will be:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `j` is `-1`.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- For each `j` from `0` to `m - 1`, if `i < n - 1` and `j < m - 1` and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `bottom_right[i][j]` is `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `-1`, `m` is greater than 0. For each `j` from `0` to `m - 1`, if `i < n - 1` and `j < m - 1` and `table[i + 1][j] == table[i][j + 1] == table[i][j]`, then `bottom_right[i][j]` is `min(bottom_right[i + 1][j], bottom_right[i][j + 1]) + 1`. Otherwise, `bottom_right[i][j]` remains unchanged.**
