The code updates the value at `bottom_right[i][j]` using the minimum of the values at `bottom_right[i + 1][j]` and `bottom_right[i][j + 1]`, and then adds 1 to this minimum value.

- `i` is `n - 2`
- `j` is `m - 3`
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` is greater than 2

The new value of `bottom_right[i][j]` is calculated as follows:
- The index `i + 1` is `(n - 2) + 1` which simplifies to `n - 1`.
- The index `j + 1` is `(m - 3) + 1` which simplifies to `m - 2`.

Thus, the value at `bottom_right[n - 2][m - 3]` is updated to be the minimum of `bottom_right[n - 1][m - 3]` and `bottom_right[n - 2][m - 2]`, plus 1.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 3`, `m` is greater than 2, `bottom_right[n - 2][m - 3]` is `min(bottom_right[n - 1][m - 3], bottom_right[n - 2][m - 2]) + 1`**
