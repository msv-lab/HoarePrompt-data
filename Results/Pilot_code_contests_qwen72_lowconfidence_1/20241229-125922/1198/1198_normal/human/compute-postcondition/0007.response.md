The code `table.append(input())` adds a new user input to the end of the `table` list. The initial state specifies that `table` already contains the user input and one additional user input. After this line of code, `table` will contain three elements: the original user input, the additional user input, and the new user input.

The other variables, `n` and `m`, are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing the user input, one additional user input, and another new user input**
