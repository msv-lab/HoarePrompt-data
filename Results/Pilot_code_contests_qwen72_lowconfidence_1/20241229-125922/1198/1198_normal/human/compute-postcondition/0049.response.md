To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop executes and how the variables change over the iterations.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs (if `n` is 0, `table` remains an empty list).
- `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` are the values returned by `create_table()`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if i > 0 and j > 0 and table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]:
            top_left[i][j] = min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **If `n` is 0**:
   - The outer loop does not execute.
   - `table` remains an empty list.
   - `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, and `bottom_right` remain as they were initially (values returned by `create_table()`).

2. **If `n` is greater than 0**:
   - The outer loop will execute `n` times.
   - The inner loop will execute `m` times for each iteration of the outer loop.
   - The condition `i > 0 and j > 0 and table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j]` checks if the current cell and its immediate left and above cells have the same value.
   - If the condition is true, `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`.

### Final Output State:
- **`n`** is a non-negative integer.
- **`m`** is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- **`table`** is a list containing `n` user inputs (if `n` is 0, `table` remains an empty list).
- **`top_left`** is a table where for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i > 0 and j > 0 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`; otherwise, `top_left[i][j]` remains unchanged.
- **`top_right`**, **`bottom_left`**, and **`bottom_right`** are the values returned by `create_table()`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs (if `n` is 0, `table` remains an empty list), `top_left` is a table where for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `i > 0 and j > 0 and (table[i - 1][j] == table[i][j - 1] == table[i][j])`, then `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i - 1][j], top_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`; otherwise, `top_left[i][j]` remains unchanged, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`**.
