To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The initial state provides that `n` is a non-negative integer, which means `n` could be 0 or any positive integer. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.

Additionally, the state mentions that `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, which implies that if `n` is 0, `table` is an empty list. However, if `n` is greater than 0, `table` should contain `n` elements, each representing a user input.

The other variables (`m`, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`) are mentioned but do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute. Therefore, they do not need adjustment for the loop to run.

Given this, the adjusted state for the loop to execute would be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `top_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `top_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_left` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `bottom_right` is the value returned by `create_table()`, `i` is 0**
