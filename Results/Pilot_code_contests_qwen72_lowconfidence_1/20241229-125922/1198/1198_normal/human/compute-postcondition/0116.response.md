To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the state changes:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(m):` will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `m`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0.
   - `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
   - `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`.
   - `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - If `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is greater than 0, and the elements `table[i + 1][j]`, `table[i][j - 1]`, and `table[i][j]` are all equal, then `bottom_left[i][j]` is set to `min(bottom_left[i + 1][j], bottom_left[i][j - 1]) + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The condition `j < m` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Given the current state:
- `j` is 0.
- `m` is greater than 0 (since it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at all).

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented to 1.
- `m` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 1, `table` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `top_left` and `top_right` are tables with specific conditions based on `table`, `bottom_left` and `bottom_right` are initialized by `create_table()`, `j` is 1.**
