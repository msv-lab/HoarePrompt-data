The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input and returns it. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that an integer value, which was provided by the user via standard input, is returned. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the user inputs a non-integer value, which would result in a `ValueError` being raised. Additionally, if the standard input is closed or unavailable, the function will raise an `EOFError`.
