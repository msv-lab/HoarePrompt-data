#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is independent of the problem's main logic. It simply reads an integer from the standard input.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer read from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input and returns it. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that an integer value, which was provided by the user via standard input, is returned. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the user inputs a non-integer value, which would result in a `ValueError` being raised. Additionally, if the standard input is closed or unavailable, the function will raise an `EOFError`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function is expected to read input that can be split into integers.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each segment into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty or consists only of spaces, an empty list will be returned.

Here, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, and `bottom_right` is updated as described in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` processes a fabric represented by a grid of colors (a list of strings) and calculates a score based on the patterns of colors in the grid. Specifically, it initializes four auxiliary tables (`top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`) to store the sizes of square patterns found in the fabric. These tables are updated based on the following conditions:

1. For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid:
   - If `i > 0` and `j > 0` and the colors of the cells `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i, j)` are the same, `top_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_left[i-1][j], top_left[i][j-1]) + 1`.
   - If `i > 0` and `j < m-1` and the colors of the cells `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j+1)`, and `(i, j)` are the same, `top_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(top_right[i-1][j], top_right[i][j+1]) + 1`.
   - If `i < n-1` and `j > 0` and the colors of the cells `(i+1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i, j)` are the same, `bottom_left[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_left[i+1][j], bottom_left[i][j-1]) + 1`.
   - If `i < n-1` and `j < m-1` and the colors of the cells `(i+1, j)`, `(i, j+1)`, and `(i, j)` are the same, `bottom_right[i][j]` is updated to `min(bottom_right[i+1][j], bottom_right[i][j+1]) + 1`.

2. After updating these tables, the function calculates the final score by summing the minimum values of `top_left[i][j]`, `top_right[i][j]`, `bottom_left[i][j]`, and `bottom_right[i][j]` for each cell `(i, j)` in the grid.

3. The function returns this score.

Edge Cases:
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 0 because there are no rows in the grid.
- If `m` is 0, the function also returns 0 because there are no columns in the grid.
- If the grid is empty (both `n` and `m` are 0), the function returns 0.
- If the grid contains only one row or one column, the function will not update the auxiliary tables for cells that do not have the required neighbors, and the score will be based on the initial values of these tables (which are typically initialized to 0).

Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that the `create_table()` function initializes the auxiliary tables correctly. If `create_table()` does not initialize the tables properly, the function's behavior could be incorrect.
- The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., if `func_2()` returns invalid dimensions or if the input strings are not of the correct length). This could lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m and n are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table to be created.
def create_table():
    return [[(1) for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each inner list has `m` elements, all set to 1, and there are `n` such inner lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `create_table` is intended to accept two parameters `m` and `n`, both positive integers, and return a list of lists where each inner list contains `m` elements set to 1, and there are `n` such inner lists. However, the function as written does not actually accept any parameters, which means it will result in a `NameError` when `m` and `n` are not defined in the global scope. If `m` and `n` are defined externally, the function will behave as described in the annotations. Therefore, the function should be modified to accept `m` and `n` as parameters to ensure it works correctly. After the function executes, assuming `m` and `n` are defined, it will return a 2D list (a list of lists) with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is 1.
