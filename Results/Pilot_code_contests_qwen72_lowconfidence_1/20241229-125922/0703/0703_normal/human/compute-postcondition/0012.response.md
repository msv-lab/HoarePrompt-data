To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n`, `b`, `input`, `seq`, `d`, `ans` remain unchanged.
- `ansb` is now `max(val, ansb)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (g, val) in seq:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `seq`.
2. **State Variables**:
   - `seq` is the sequence being iterated over.
   - `(g, val)` are the current elements being unpacked from `seq` in each iteration.
   - `ansb` is updated in each iteration to be the maximum of the current `val` and the previous `ansb`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **End of Previous Iteration**:
  - `n`, `b`, `input`, `seq`, `d`, `ans` remain unchanged.
  - `ansb` is updated to `max(val, ansb)`.

- **Start of Next Iteration**:
  - The next element `(g, val)` in `seq` will be unpacked.
  - `ansb` will retain its value from the end of the previous iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`seq`**: The next element in `seq` will be unpacked into `(g, val)`.
- **`ansb`**: Remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, which is `max(val, ansb)`.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `b`, `input`, `seq`, `d`, `ans` remain unchanged, `ansb` is `max(val, ansb)`, the next element in `seq` is unpacked into `(g, val)`**.
