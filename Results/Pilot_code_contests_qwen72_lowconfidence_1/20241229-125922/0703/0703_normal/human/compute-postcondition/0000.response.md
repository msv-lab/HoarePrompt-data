The provided code snippet `input = sys.stdin.readline` reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.readline`. This change affects how input is read from the standard input in subsequent parts of the program.

- `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `b` remains a list of n integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5.
- The built-in `input` function is now an alias for `sys.stdin.readline`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `b` is a list of n integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5, `input` is now an alias for `sys.stdin.readline`**.
