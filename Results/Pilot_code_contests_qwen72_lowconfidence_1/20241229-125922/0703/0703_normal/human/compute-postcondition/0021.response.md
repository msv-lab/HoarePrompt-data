An exception in the given `try` block could occur when attempting to increment `d[abs(g)]` by `val`. Specifically, a `KeyError` would be raised if `abs(g)` is not already a key in the dictionary `d`.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step summary of what the `try`-`except` statement accomplishes:

1. **Try Block**: The program attempts to increment the value associated with the key `abs(g)` in the dictionary `d` by `val`.
   - If `abs(g)` is already a key in `d`, the value is incremented by `val`.
   - If `abs(g)` is not a key in `d`, a `KeyError` is raised.

2. **Except Block**: If a `KeyError` is raised (or any other exception), the program catches the exception and sets `d[abs(g)]` to `val`.

Therefore, after the complete execution of the `try` statement, the program state is as follows:
- `n`, `b`, `input`, `seq` must have at least one more element.
- `d[abs(g)]` is set to `val` if it did not exist before, or incremented by `val` if it did.
- `ans` remains unchanged.
- `ansb` is `max(val, ansb)`.

Output State: **`n`, `b`, `input`, `seq` must have at least one more element, `d[abs(g)]` is set to `val` if it did not exist before, or incremented by `val` if it did, `ans` remains unchanged, `ansb` is `max(val, ansb)`.**
