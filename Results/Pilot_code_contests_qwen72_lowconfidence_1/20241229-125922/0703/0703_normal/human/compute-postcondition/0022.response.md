The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by taking the maximum of its current value and the value of `d[abs(g)]`. The value of `d[abs(g)]` was previously set or incremented by `val`. The state of `ansb` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`n`, `b`, `input`, `seq` must have at least one more element, `d[abs(g)]` is set to `val` if it did not exist before, or incremented by `val` if it did, `ans` is `max(ans, d[abs(g)])`, `ansb` is `max(val, ansb)`**
