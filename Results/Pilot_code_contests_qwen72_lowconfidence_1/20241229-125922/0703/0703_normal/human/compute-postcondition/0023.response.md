The value of `ansb` is updated to the maximum of `val` and the current value of `ansb`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `b`, `input`, `seq` must have at least one more element, `d[abs(g)]` is set to `val` if it did not exist before, or incremented by `val` if it did, `ans` is `max(ans, d[abs(g)])`, `ansb` is `max(val, ansb)`**
