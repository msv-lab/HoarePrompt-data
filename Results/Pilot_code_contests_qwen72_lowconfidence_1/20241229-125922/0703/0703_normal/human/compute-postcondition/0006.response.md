To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given code and initial state:

1. **`seq`**: This is a sorted list of tuples. For the loop to execute, `seq` must contain at least one tuple.
2. **`(g, val)`**: These are the elements of the tuples in `seq`. The loop will iterate over these elements.
3. **Other Variables**: `n`, `b`, `input`, `d`, `ans`, and `ansb` are provided, but they do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

Given this, we need to ensure that `seq` is not empty. If `seq` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `seq` contains at least one tuple.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Check `seq`**: Ensure that `seq` is not empty.
2. **Initial Values**: The other variables (`n`, `b`, `input`, `d`, `ans`, `ansb`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, but their values should be noted.

### Adjusted State:
- `seq` must contain at least one tuple.
- The initial values of other variables remain as they are.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`, `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 4 \cdot 10^5\), `input` is now an alias for `sys.stdin.readline`, `seq` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(int(x) - i, int(x))` for each `i, x` in `enumerate(input().split())` and must contain at least one tuple, `d` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `ansb` is 0**
