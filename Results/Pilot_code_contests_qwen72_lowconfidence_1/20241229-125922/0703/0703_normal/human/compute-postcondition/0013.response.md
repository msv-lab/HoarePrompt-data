The code snippet updates the dictionary `d` by incrementing the value associated with the key `abs(g)` by `val`. The next element in the sequence `seq` is unpacked into `(g, val)`, and `ansb` is updated to be the maximum of `val` and its current value. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `input`, `seq`, `d`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Let's break down the changes:

1. `d[abs(g)] += val`: This increments the value of `d` at the key `abs(g)` by `val`.
2. `ansb` is updated to `max(val, ansb)`: This sets `ansb` to the maximum of `val` and its current value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `b`, `input`, `seq`, `d`, `ans` remain unchanged, `ansb` is `max(val, ansb)`, the next element in `seq` is unpacked into `(g, val)`, `d[abs(g)]` is incremented by `val`.**
