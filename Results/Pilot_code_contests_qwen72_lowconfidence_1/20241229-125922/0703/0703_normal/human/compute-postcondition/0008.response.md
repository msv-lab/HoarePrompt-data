The code snippet `d[abs(g)] = val` impacts the dictionary `d` by assigning the value `val` to the key `abs(g)`. The absolute value of `g` is used as the key. The previous values of `d`, `g`, and `val` are not specified, so they remain unknown. However, after this assignment, the dictionary `d` now contains the key-value pair where the key is `abs(g)` and the value is `val`.

Output State: **the state is unknown, except `d[abs(g)]` is `val`**
