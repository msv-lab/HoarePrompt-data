Postcondition: ***`n` is the initial integer value, `b` is the initial list of integers, `input` is an alias for `sys.stdin.readline`, `seq` is the initial sorted list of tuples, `d` is a dictionary where each key is the absolute value of the first element of the tuples in `seq` and the value is the cumulative sum of the corresponding `val` values, `ans` is the maximum value found in `d` and its current value is 0, `ansb` is the maximum value of `val` encountered during the loop.***
