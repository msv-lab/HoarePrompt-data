To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n`, `b`, `input`, `seq`, `d`, `ans` remain unchanged.
- `ansb` is `max(val, ansb)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (g, val) in seq:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the sequence `seq`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `seq`.
2. **State Variables**:
   - `n`, `b`, `input`, `seq`, `d`, `ans` remain unchanged.
   - `ansb` is updated to `max(val, ansb)` at the end of each iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `seq`.
- The variable `ansb` will be updated to the maximum value between the current `val` and the previous `ansb`.

### Next Iteration State:
- `seq` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.
- `ansb` will be the maximum value between the current `val` and the previous `ansb`.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `b`, `input`, `seq` must have at least one more element, `d`, `ans` remain unchanged, `ansb` is `max(val, ansb)`**
