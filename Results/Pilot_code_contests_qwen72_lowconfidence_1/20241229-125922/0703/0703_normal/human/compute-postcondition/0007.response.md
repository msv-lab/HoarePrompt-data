The code snippet `d[abs(g)] += val` updates the dictionary `d` by adding `val` to the value associated with the key `abs(g)`. This assumes that `g` and `val` are already defined and accessible within the scope of this code snippet.

- `d` is an empty dictionary initially, so if `abs(g)` is not already a key in `d`, this operation will create the key and set its value to `val`.
- The operation `abs(g)` computes the absolute value of `g`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`.
- `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 4 \cdot 10^5\).
- `input` is now an alias for `sys.stdin.readline`.
- `seq` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(int(x) - i, int(x))` for each `i, x` in `enumerate(input().split())` and must contain at least one tuple.
- `d` is an empty dictionary.
- `ans` is 0.
- `ansb` is 0.

After executing the code snippet `d[abs(g)] += val`:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`, `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 4 \cdot 10^5\), `input` is now an alias for `sys.stdin.readline`, `seq` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(int(x) - i, int(x))` for each `i, x` in `enumerate(input().split())` and must contain at least one tuple, `d` is a dictionary with `abs(g)` as a key and its value is `val` if `abs(g)` was not previously in `d`, otherwise its value is the previous value plus `val`, `ans` is 0, `ansb` is 0**.
