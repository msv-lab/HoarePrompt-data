The code snippet updates the dictionary `d` by incrementing the value associated with the key `abs(g)` by `val`. Here's the updated state:

- `d[abs(g)]` is incremented by `val`.
- `n`, `b`, `input`, `seq` must have at least one more element.
- `d` remains a dictionary with the updated value for the key `abs(g)`.
- `ans` remains unchanged.
- `ansb` is `max(val, ansb)`.

Output State: **`n`, `b`, `input`, `seq` must have at least one more element, `d[abs(g)]` is incremented by `val`, `ans` remains unchanged, `ansb` is `max(val, ansb)`**
