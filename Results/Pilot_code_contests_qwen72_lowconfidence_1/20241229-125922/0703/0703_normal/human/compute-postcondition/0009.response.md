An exception could occur when trying to access or update the dictionary `d` with the key `abs(g)`. Specifically, if `abs(g)` is not already a key in `d`, attempting to use the `+=` operator on `d[abs(g)]` would raise a `KeyError`.

The `try` block attempts to increment the value associated with the key `abs(g)` in the dictionary `d` by `val`. If `abs(g)` is already a key in `d`, the value is incremented without any issues. However, if `abs(g)` is not a key in `d`, a `KeyError` is raised, and the `except` block is executed. In the `except` block, the key `abs(g)` is added to `d` with the value `val`.

Therefore, after the complete execution of the `try` statement, the program state is as follows:

- `n` is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`.
- `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 4 \cdot 10^5\).
- `input` is now an alias for `sys.stdin.readline`.
- `seq` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(int(x) - i, int(x))` for each `i, x` in `enumerate(input().split())` and must contain at least one tuple.
- `d` is a dictionary with `abs(g)` as a key and its value is `val` if `abs(g)` was not previously in `d`, otherwise its value is the previous value plus `val`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `ansb` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`, `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 4 \cdot 10^5\), `input` is now an alias for `sys.stdin.readline`, `seq` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(int(x) - i, int(x))` for each `i, x` in `enumerate(input().split())` and must contain at least one tuple, `d` is a dictionary with `abs(g)` as a key and its value is `val` if `abs(g)` was not previously in `d`, otherwise its value is the previous value plus `val`, `ans` is 0, `ansb` is 0.**
