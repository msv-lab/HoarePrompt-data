The code snippet `ansb = max(val, ansb)` updates the value of `ansb` to the maximum value between `val` and the current value of `ansb`. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `input`, `seq`, `d`, `ans`) are not affected by this code.

Given the initial state:
- The initial state variables `n`, `b`, `input`, `seq`, `d`, and `ansb` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `max(0, d[abs(g)])`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `ansb` is now the maximum of `val` and the previous value of `ansb`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n`, `b`, `input`, `seq`, `d`, `ans` remain unchanged, `ansb` is now `max(val, ansb)`**.
