An exception in the `try` block could occur when attempting to execute `d[abs(g)] += val`. Specifically, this could happen if `abs(g)` is not already a key in the dictionary `d`, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Try Block Execution:**
   - The code attempts to update the dictionary `d` by incrementing the value associated with the key `abs(g)` by `val`.
   - If `abs(g)` is already a key in `d`, the value at `d[abs(g)]` is incremented by `val`.
   - If `abs(g)` is not a key in `d`, a `KeyError` is raised.

2. **Except Block Execution:**
   - If a `KeyError` is raised, the `except` block catches the exception.
   - In the `except` block, `d[abs(g)]` is set to `val`, effectively adding the key `abs(g)` to the dictionary `d` with the value `val`.

### Summary of the Try-Except Statement:

- **Try Block:** Attempts to increment the value at `d[abs(g)]` by `val`.
- **Except Block:** If `abs(g)` is not a key in `d`, sets `d[abs(g)]` to `val`.

### Final Output State:

- `n`, `b`, `input`, `seq`, `d`, `ans` remain unchanged.
- `ansb` is updated to `max(val, ansb)`.
- The next element in `seq` is unpacked into `(g, val)`.
- If `abs(g)` is a key in `d`, `d[abs(g)]` is incremented by `val`.
- If `abs(g)` is not a key in `d`, `d[abs(g)]` is set to `val`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n`, `b`, `input`, `seq`, `d`, `ans` remain unchanged, `ansb` is `max(val, ansb)`, the next element in `seq` is unpacked into `(g, val)`, and `d[abs(g)]` is either incremented by `val` or set to `val` if `abs(g)` is not already a key in `d`.**
