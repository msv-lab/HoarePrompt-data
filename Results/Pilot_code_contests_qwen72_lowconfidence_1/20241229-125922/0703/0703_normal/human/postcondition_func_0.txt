The function reads a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a list `b` of `n` integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5) from standard input. It then processes these inputs to compute the maximum cumulative value associated with the absolute difference between the elements of `b` and their indices. Specifically, it creates a dictionary `d` where each key is the absolute difference (`|b_i - i|`) and the value is the cumulative sum of the corresponding `b_i` values. The function outputs the maximum value found in this dictionary. If no cumulative value is found (i.e., `ans` is 0), it outputs the maximum individual value from the list `b`. The final state of the program includes the original `n`, the original list `b`, the dictionary `d`, and the computed maximum value `ans`.
