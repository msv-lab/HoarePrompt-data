You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Tanya wants to go on a journey across the cities of Berland. There are n cities situated along the main railroad line of Berland, and these cities are numbered from 1 to n. 

Tanya plans her journey as follows. First of all, she will choose some city c_1 to start her journey. She will visit it, and after that go to some other city c_2 > c_1, then to some other city c_3 > c_2, and so on, until she chooses to end her journey in some city c_k > c_{k - 1}. So, the sequence of visited cities [c_1, c_2, ..., c_k] should be strictly increasing.

There are some additional constraints on the sequence of cities Tanya visits. Each city i has a beauty value b_i associated with it. If there is only one city in Tanya's journey, these beauty values imply no additional constraints. But if there are multiple cities in the sequence, then for any pair of adjacent cities c_i and c_{i + 1}, the condition c_{i + 1} - c_i = b_{c_{i + 1}} - b_{c_i} must hold.

For example, if n = 8 and b = [3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9], there are several three possible ways to plan a journey:

  * c = [1, 2, 4]; 
  * c = [3, 5, 6, 8]; 
  * c = [7] (a journey consisting of one city is also valid). 



There are some additional ways to plan a journey that are not listed above.

Tanya wants her journey to be as beautiful as possible. The beauty value of the whole journey is the sum of beauty values over all visited cities. Can you help her to choose the optimal plan, that is, to maximize the beauty value of the journey?

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of cities in Berland.

The second line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5), where b_i is the beauty value of the i-th city.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum beauty of a journey Tanya can choose.

Note

The optimal journey plan in the first example is c = [2, 4, 5].

The optimal journey plan in the second example is c = [1].

The optimal journey plan in the third example is c = [3, 6].
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    n = int(input())
    seq = sorted(((int(x) - i, int(x)) for (i, x) in enumerate(input().split())), key=lambda x: x[0])
    d = dict()
    ans = 0
    ansb = 0
    for (g, val) in seq:
        try:
            d[abs(g)] += val
        except:
            d[abs(g)] = val
        ans = max(ans, d[abs(g)])
        ansb = max(val, ansb)
    if ans == 0:
        ans = ansb
    print(ans)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
