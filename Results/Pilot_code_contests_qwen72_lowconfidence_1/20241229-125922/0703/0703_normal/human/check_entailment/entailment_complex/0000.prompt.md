You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Tanya wants to go on a journey across the cities of Berland. There are n cities situated along the main railroad line of Berland, and these cities are numbered from 1 to n. 

Tanya plans her journey as follows. First of all, she will choose some city c_1 to start her journey. She will visit it, and after that go to some other city c_2 > c_1, then to some other city c_3 > c_2, and so on, until she chooses to end her journey in some city c_k > c_{k - 1}. So, the sequence of visited cities [c_1, c_2, ..., c_k] should be strictly increasing.

There are some additional constraints on the sequence of cities Tanya visits. Each city i has a beauty value b_i associated with it. If there is only one city in Tanya's journey, these beauty values imply no additional constraints. But if there are multiple cities in the sequence, then for any pair of adjacent cities c_i and c_{i + 1}, the condition c_{i + 1} - c_i = b_{c_{i + 1}} - b_{c_i} must hold.

For example, if n = 8 and b = [3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9], there are several three possible ways to plan a journey:

  * c = [1, 2, 4]; 
  * c = [3, 5, 6, 8]; 
  * c = [7] (a journey consisting of one city is also valid). 



There are some additional ways to plan a journey that are not listed above.

Tanya wants her journey to be as beautiful as possible. The beauty value of the whole journey is the sum of beauty values over all visited cities. Can you help her to choose the optimal plan, that is, to maximize the beauty value of the journey?

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of cities in Berland.

The second line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5), where b_i is the beauty value of the i-th city.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum beauty of a journey Tanya can choose.

Note

The optimal journey plan in the first example is c = [2, 4, 5].

The optimal journey plan in the second example is c = [1].

The optimal journey plan in the third example is c = [3, 6].
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and b is a list of n integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    n = int(input())
    seq = sorted(((int(x) - i, int(x)) for i, x in enumerate(input().split())),
    key=lambda x: x[0])
    d = dict()
    ans = 0
    ansb = 0
    for (g, val) in seq:
        try:
            d[abs(g)] += val
        except:
            d[abs(g)] = val
        
        ans = max(ans, d[abs(g)])
        
        ansb = max(val, ansb)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the initial integer value, `b` is the initial list of integers, `input` is an alias for `sys.stdin.readline`, `seq` is the initial sorted list of tuples, `d` is a dictionary where each key is the absolute value of the first element of the tuples in `seq` and the value is the cumulative sum of the corresponding `val` values, `ans` is the maximum value found in `d`, `ansb` is the maximum value of `val` encountered during the loop.
    if (ans == 0) :
        ans = ansb
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is the initial integer value, `b` is the initial list of integers, `input` is an alias for `sys.stdin.readline`, `seq` is the initial sorted list of tuples, `d` is a dictionary where each key is the absolute value of the first element of the tuples in `seq` and the value is the cumulative sum of the corresponding `val` values, `ansb` is the maximum value of `val` encountered during the loop. If `ans` is 0, `ans` is updated to the maximum value of `val` encountered during the loop. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a list `b` of `n` integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5) from standard input. It then processes these inputs to compute the maximum cumulative value associated with the absolute difference between the elements of `b` and their indices. Specifically, it creates a dictionary `d` where each key is the absolute difference (`|b_i - i|`) and the value is the cumulative sum of the corresponding `b_i` values. The function outputs the maximum value found in this dictionary. If no cumulative value is found (i.e., `ans` is 0), it outputs the maximum individual value from the list `b`. The final state of the program includes the original `n`, the original list `b`, the dictionary `d`, and the computed maximum value `ans`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
