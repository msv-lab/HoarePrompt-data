You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n kangaroos with pockets. Each kangaroo has a size (integer number). A kangaroo can go into another kangaroo's pocket if and only if the size of kangaroo who hold the kangaroo is at least twice as large as the size of kangaroo who is held.

Each kangaroo can hold at most one kangaroo, and the kangaroo who is held by another kangaroo cannot hold any kangaroos.

The kangaroo who is held by another kangaroo cannot be visible from outside. Please, find a plan of holding kangaroos with the minimal number of kangaroos who is visible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105). Each of the next n lines contains an integer si — the size of the i-th kangaroo (1 ≤ si ≤ 105).

Output

Output a single integer — the optimal number of visible kangaroos.

Program:
```
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    arr = []
    for (e, line) in enumerate(sys.stdin.readlines()):
        if e == 0:
            continue
        arr.append(int(line.strip()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    if len(arr) == 1:
        return 1
    arr.sort()
    start = 0
    move = len(arr) // 2
    ans = len(arr)
    while move < len(arr):
        if arr[start] is None:
            move += 1
        elif arr[start] * 2 > arr[move]:
            move += 1
        else:
            arr[move] = None
            ans -= 1
            move += 1
            start += 1
    return ans


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has an issue in how it handles the visibility of kangaroos. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the `ans` variable by decrementing it each time a kangaroo is placed inside another kangaroo. However, this approach may lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

Consider the following input:
```
5
1
2
3
4
8
```
The correct output should be 3, as the kangaroos can be arranged as follows:
- Kangaroo with size 8 holds kangaroo with size 4.
- Kangaroo with size 4 holds kangaroo with size 2.
- Kangaroo with size 2 holds kangaroo with size 1.

Thus, only the kangaroos with sizes 8, 3, and 1 are visible.

However, the provided program will output 4, which is incorrect. This is because the program does not correctly account for the fact that a kangaroo can only hold one other kangaroo, and once a kangaroo is held, it cannot hold any more kangaroos. The program's logic for updating the `ans` variable and moving through the array can lead to incorrect results in such cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    arr = []
    for (e, line) in enumerate(sys.stdin.readlines()):
        if e == 0:
            continue
        arr.append(int(line.strip()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of a kangaroo, and the length of arr is between 1 and 5·10^5, inclusive. Each element in arr is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    if (len(arr) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of a kangaroo, and the length of arr is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive. Each element in arr is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.
    arr.sort()
    start = 0
    move = len(arr) // 2
    ans = len(arr)
    while move < len(arr):
        if arr[start] is None:
            move += 1
        elif arr[start] * 2 > arr[move]:
            move += 1
        else:
            arr[move] = None
            ans -= 1
            move += 1
            start += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, with some elements set to `None` starting from the middle and moving towards the end, `start` is the number of elements that were processed and set to `None`, `move` is `len(arr)`, and `ans` is the original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers, where each integer represents the size of a kangaroo. The function returns the maximum number of kangaroos that can be paired such that the size of the larger kangaroo in each pair is at most twice the size of the smaller kangaroo. If the list contains only one element, the function returns 1. After the function executes, the input list `arr` is sorted in ascending order, and some elements in the list may be set to `None`. The returned value is the original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
