Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` aims to minimize the number of visible kangaroos by pairing them according to the given rules. However, the implementation has a logical flaw that causes it to produce incorrect results in certain cases.

### Issue Analysis:
1. **Pairing Logic**: The code attempts to pair kangaroos by iterating through the sorted list and checking if the size of the current kangaroo (`arr[start]`) is less than or equal to half the size of the kangaroo at the `move` index (`arr[move]`). If this condition is met, the kangaroo at the `move` index is marked as `None` (indicating it is being held), and the count of visible kangaroos is decreased.

2. **Incorrect Pairing**: The main issue is in the condition `elif arr[start] * 2 > arr[move]: move += 1`. This condition incorrectly increments the `move` index even when the current kangaroo (`arr[start]`) cannot be paired with the kangaroo at the `move` index. This can lead to missing valid pairs.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle the edge case where the list contains only one element correctly. While the base case `if len(arr) == 1: return 1` is correct, the logic inside the while loop can still fail for other edge cases.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
8
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
```

The correct output should be 4, but the provided code will return 5. Here's why:

- The sorted list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
- The code will attempt to pair the kangaroos as follows:
  - `1` cannot be paired with `2` (since `1 * 2 <= 2` is false).
  - `2` cannot be paired with `3` (since `2 * 2 <= 3` is false).
  - `3` can be paired with `6` (since `3 * 2 <= 6` is true).
  - `4` cannot be paired with `5` (since `4 * 2 <= 5` is false).
  - `5` cannot be paired with `7` (since `5 * 2 <= 7` is false).
  - `6` is already paired with `3`.
  - `7` cannot be paired with `8` (since `7 * 2 <= 8` is false).

The code will incorrectly leave `1`, `2`, `4`, `5`, and `7` as visible, resulting in 5 visible kangaroos instead of the correct 4.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the number of visible kangaroos for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
