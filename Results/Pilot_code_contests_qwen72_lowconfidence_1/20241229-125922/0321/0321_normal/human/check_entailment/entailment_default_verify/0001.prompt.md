You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n kangaroos with pockets. Each kangaroo has a size (integer number). A kangaroo can go into another kangaroo's pocket if and only if the size of kangaroo who hold the kangaroo is at least twice as large as the size of kangaroo who is held.

Each kangaroo can hold at most one kangaroo, and the kangaroo who is held by another kangaroo cannot hold any kangaroos.

The kangaroo who is held by another kangaroo cannot be visible from outside. Please, find a plan of holding kangaroos with the minimal number of kangaroos who is visible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105). Each of the next n lines contains an integer si — the size of the i-th kangaroo (1 ≤ si ≤ 105).

Output

Output a single integer — the optimal number of visible kangaroos.

import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    arr = []
    for (e, line) in enumerate(sys.stdin.readlines()):
        if e == 0:
            continue
        arr.append(int(line.strip()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    if len(arr) == 1:
        return 1
    arr.sort()
    start = 0
    move = len(arr) // 2
    ans = len(arr)
    while move < len(arr):
        if arr[start] is None:
            move += 1
        elif arr[start] * 2 > arr[move]:
            move += 1
        else:
            arr[move] = None
            ans -= 1
            move += 1
            start += 1
    return ans


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where multiple kangaroos of the same size are present, and the logic for pairing them might fail to produce the correct result. Specifically, the condition `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move]` should be `arr[start] * 2 <= arr[move]` to ensure that a larger kangaroo can hold a smaller one if its size is at least twice as large.

Consider the following input:
```
4
2
2
4
4
```
The correct output should be `2`, because the two kangaroos of size 4 can each hold one of the kangaroos of size 2. However, the given program will output `4` because it incorrectly pairs the kangaroos.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers, where each integer represents the size of a kangaroo. The function returns the maximum number of kangaroos that can be paired such that the size of the larger kangaroo in each pair is at most twice the size of the smaller kangaroo. If the list contains only one element, the function returns 1. After the function executes, the input list `arr` is sorted in ascending order, and some elements in the list may be set to `None`. The returned value is the original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
