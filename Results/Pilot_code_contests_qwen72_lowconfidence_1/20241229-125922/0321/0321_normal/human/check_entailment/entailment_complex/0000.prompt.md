You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n kangaroos with pockets. Each kangaroo has a size (integer number). A kangaroo can go into another kangaroo's pocket if and only if the size of kangaroo who hold the kangaroo is at least twice as large as the size of kangaroo who is held.

Each kangaroo can hold at most one kangaroo, and the kangaroo who is held by another kangaroo cannot hold any kangaroos.

The kangaroo who is held by another kangaroo cannot be visible from outside. Please, find a plan of holding kangaroos with the minimal number of kangaroos who is visible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105). Each of the next n lines contains an integer si — the size of the i-th kangaroo (1 ≤ si ≤ 105).

Output

Output a single integer — the optimal number of visible kangaroos.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    arr = []
    for (e, line) in enumerate(sys.stdin.readlines()):
        if e == 0:
            continue
        arr.append(int(line.strip()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of a kangaroo, and the length of arr is between 1 and 5·10^5, inclusive. Each element in arr is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    if (len(arr) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of a kangaroo, and the length of arr is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive. Each element in arr is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.
    arr.sort()
    start = 0
    move = len(arr) // 2
    ans = len(arr)
    while move < len(arr):
        if arr[start] is None:
            move += 1
        elif arr[start] * 2 > arr[move]:
            move += 1
        else:
            arr[move] = None
            ans -= 1
            move += 1
            start += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, with some elements set to `None` starting from the middle and moving towards the end, `start` is the number of elements that were processed and set to `None`, `move` is `len(arr)`, and `ans` is the original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers, where each integer represents the size of a kangaroo. The function returns the maximum number of kangaroos that can be paired such that the size of the larger kangaroo in each pair is at most twice the size of the smaller kangaroo. If the list contains only one element, the function returns 1. After the function executes, the input list `arr` is sorted in ascending order, and some elements in the list may be set to `None`. The returned value is the original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
