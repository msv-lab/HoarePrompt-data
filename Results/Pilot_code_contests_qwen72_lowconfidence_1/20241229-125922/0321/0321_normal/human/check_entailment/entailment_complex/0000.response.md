Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input from standard input (`sys.stdin.readlines()`), skips the first line (which is the number of kangaroos), and appends the remaining lines (sizes of kangaroos) to a list `arr`.

2. **Base Case**: If the list `arr` contains only one element, the function `func_1` returns 1, which is correct because there is only one kangaroo, and it is visible.

3. **Sorting**: The list `arr` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting is necessary to efficiently pair the smallest possible kangaroo with a larger kangaroo that can hold it.

4. **Pairing Logic**: The program uses a two-pointer approach to pair kangaroos:
   - `start` points to the current kangaroo being considered for pairing.
   - `move` points to the potential kangaroo that can hold the kangaroo at `start`.
   - The loop continues until `move` reaches the end of the list.
   - If the kangaroo at `start` is already paired (set to `None`), `move` is incremented.
   - If the kangaroo at `start` can fit into the kangaroo at `move` (i.e., `arr[start] * 2 <= arr[move]`), the kangaroo at `move` is marked as paired (set to `None`), and both pointers are incremented.
   - If the kangaroo at `start` cannot fit into the kangaroo at `move`, only `move` is incremented.

5. **Result Calculation**: The variable `ans` initially holds the total number of kangaroos. For each successful pairing, `ans` is decremented. The final value of `ans` is the number of visible kangaroos, which is the number of kangaroos that were not paired.

6. **Output**: The function returns the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of visible kangaroos.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the number of visible kangaroos is minimized according to the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
