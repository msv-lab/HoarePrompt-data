The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers, where each integer represents the size of a kangaroo. The function returns the maximum number of kangaroos that can be paired such that the size of the larger kangaroo in each pair is at most twice the size of the smaller kangaroo. If the list contains only one element, the function returns 1. After the function executes, the input list `arr` is sorted in ascending order, and some elements in the list may be set to `None`. The returned value is the original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.
