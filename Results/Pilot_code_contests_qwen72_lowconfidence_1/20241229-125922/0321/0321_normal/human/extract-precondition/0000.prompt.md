You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: There are n kangaroos with pockets. Each kangaroo has a size (integer number). A kangaroo can go into another kangaroo's pocket if and only if the size of kangaroo who hold the kangaroo is at least twice as large as the size of kangaroo who is held.

Each kangaroo can hold at most one kangaroo, and the kangaroo who is held by another kangaroo cannot hold any kangaroos.

The kangaroo who is held by another kangaroo cannot be visible from outside. Please, find a plan of holding kangaroos with the minimal number of kangaroos who is visible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105). Each of the next n lines contains an integer si — the size of the i-th kangaroo (1 ≤ si ≤ 105).

Output

Output a single integer — the optimal number of visible kangaroos.
