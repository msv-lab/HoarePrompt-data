The code snippet `ans = len(arr)` assigns the length of the list `arr` to the variable `ans`.

- `arr` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- The length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive.
- Each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.
- `start` remains 0.
- `move` remains `len(arr) // 2`.
- `ans` is now equal to the length of `arr`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive, each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2`, `ans` is `len(arr)`**.
