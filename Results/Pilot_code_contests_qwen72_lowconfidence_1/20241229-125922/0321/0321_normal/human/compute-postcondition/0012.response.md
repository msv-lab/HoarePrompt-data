The value of `move` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5Â·10^5, inclusive, each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1`, `ans` is `len(arr)`, and `arr[start]` is not `None`. Additionally, the value of `arr[start]` multiplied by 2 is greater than the value of `arr[move - 1]`.**
