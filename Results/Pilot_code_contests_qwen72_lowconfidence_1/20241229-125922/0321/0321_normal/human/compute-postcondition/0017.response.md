The value of `start` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `start` was 0, so now `start` is 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with `arr[move]` set to `None`, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5Â·10^5, inclusive, each element in `arr` except `arr[move]` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, `start` is 1, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1`, `ans` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr[start]` is not `None`.**
