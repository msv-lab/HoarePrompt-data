The code snippet `arr[move] = None` updates the value of the element at index `move` in the list `arr` to `None`. This operation changes the value of `arr[move]` from its original value to `None`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, with each element between 1 and 10^5, and the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive.
- If `arr[start]` is `None`, then `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, and `ans` is `len(arr)`.
- If `arr[start]` is not `None`, `start` is either 0 or 1, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, and `ans` is either `len(arr)` or `len(arr) - 1`.
- The value of `arr[start]` multiplied by 2 is either greater or less than the respective value of `arr[move - 1]` or `arr[move]`.

After executing `arr[move] = None`, the following remains true:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, except for the element at index `move`, which is now `None`.
- The length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive.
- Each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, except for the element at index `move`, which is now `None`.
- If `arr[start]` is `None`, then `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, and `ans` is `len(arr)`.
- If `arr[start]` is not `None`, `start` is either 0 or 1, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, and `ans` is either `len(arr)` or `len(arr) - 1`.

The only change is that `arr[move]` is now `None`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, except for the element at index `move` which is now `None`, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive, each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, except for the element at index `move` which is now `None`, if `arr[start]` is `None`, then `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, and `ans` is `len(arr)`, if `arr[start]` is not `None`, `start` is either 0 or 1, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, and `ans` is either `len(arr)` or `len(arr) - 1`.**
