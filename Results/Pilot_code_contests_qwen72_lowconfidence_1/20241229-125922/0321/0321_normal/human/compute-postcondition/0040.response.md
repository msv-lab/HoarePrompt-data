The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the size of a kangaroo. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 5Â·10^5, inclusive, and each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.

- **Case_1:** The program returns 1.
- **Case_2:** The program returns the original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers, each representing the size of a kangaroo. It returns 1 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.**
