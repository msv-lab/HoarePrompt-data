To determine the final output state after the while loop has executed, let's analyze the loop step by step and consider the conditions under which the loop terminates.

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- The length of `arr` is between 2 and 5Â·10^5, inclusive.
- Each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.
- `start` is 0.
- `move` is `len(arr) // 2`.
- `ans` is `len(arr)`.

### Loop Code:
```python
while move < len(arr):
    if arr[start] is None:
        move += 1
    elif arr[start] * 2 > arr[move]:
        move += 1
    else:
        arr[move] = None
        ans -= 1
        move += 1
        start += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `move < len(arr)`.
2. **First Condition (`if arr[start] is None`)**:
   - If `arr[start]` is `None`, `move` is incremented by 1.
3. **Second Condition (`elif arr[start] * 2 > arr[move]`)**:
   - If `arr[start] * 2` is greater than `arr[move]`, `move` is incremented by 1.
4. **Third Condition (`else`)**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, `arr[move]` is set to `None`, `ans` is decremented by 1, `move` is incremented by 1, and `start` is incremented by 1.

### Termination:
- The loop terminates when `move` is no longer less than `len(arr)`.
- This means `move` will eventually reach `len(arr)`.

### Final State:
- **`arr`**: After the loop, some elements in `arr` might be set to `None` starting from the middle of the array and moving towards the end.
- **`start`**: The value of `start` will be the number of elements that were processed and set to `None`.
- **`move`**: The value of `move` will be `len(arr)`.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` will be the original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.

### Detailed Final State:
- **`arr`**: A sorted list of integers in ascending order, with some elements set to `None` starting from the middle and moving towards the end.
- **`start`**: The number of elements that were processed and set to `None`.
- **`move`**: `len(arr)`.
- **`ans`**: The original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.

### Output State:
**`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, with some elements set to `None` starting from the middle and moving towards the end, `start` is the number of elements that were processed and set to `None`, `move` is `len(arr)`, and `ans` is the original length of `arr` minus the number of elements that were set to `None`.**
