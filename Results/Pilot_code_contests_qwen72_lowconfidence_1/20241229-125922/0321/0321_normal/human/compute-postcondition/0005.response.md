The value of `move` is assigned the result of `len(arr) // 2`. This means `move` is half the length of `arr`, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- The length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive.
- Each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.
- `start` is 0.

After executing the code, the value of `move` is calculated as `len(arr) // 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive, each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2`**.
