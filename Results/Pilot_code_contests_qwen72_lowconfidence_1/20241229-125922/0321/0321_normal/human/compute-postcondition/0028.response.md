Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive, each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive. If `arr[start]` is `None`, then `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, and `ans` is `len(arr)`. If `arr[start]` is not `None`, `start` is either 0 or 1, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, and `ans` is either `len(arr)` or `len(arr) - 1`. If `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move - 1]` (in the if part) or `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move]` (in the else part), then the value of `arr[start]` multiplied by 2 is greater than the respective value of `arr[move - 1]` or `arr[move]`, and the values of `start`, `move`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `arr[move]` is set to `None`, `start` is 1, `ans` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr[start]` is not `None`. If the `else` part is executed and `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move - 2]`, then `arr[start] * 2` is greater than `arr[move - 2]`, otherwise, `arr[move - 1]` is set to `None`, `start` is 1, `ans` is `len(arr) - 2`, and `arr[start]` is not `None`.***
