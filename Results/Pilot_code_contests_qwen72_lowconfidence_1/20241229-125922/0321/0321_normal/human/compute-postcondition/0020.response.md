To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop: `move < len(arr)`. The loop will execute as long as `move` is less than the length of `arr`.

Let's break down the given state and the conditions:

1. **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order**: This property of `arr` does not change and does not affect the loop condition.

2. **The length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive**: This is a static property of `arr` and does not change over iterations.

3. **Each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive**: This is a static property of `arr` and does not change over iterations.

4. **If `arr[start]` is `None`, then `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1`, and `ans` is `len(arr)`**: This condition describes an initial state or a state after a specific operation.

5. **Otherwise, if `arr[start]` is not `None`, `start` is either 0 or 1, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1`, and `ans` is either `len(arr)` or `len(arr) - 1`**: This condition describes another possible state.

6. **If `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move - 1]`, then the value of `arr[start]` multiplied by 2 is greater than the value of `arr[move - 1]`**: This is a condition that might be checked within the loop body but does not directly affect the loop condition.

7. **Otherwise, `arr[move]` is set to `None`, `start` is 1, `ans` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr[start]` is not `None`**: This describes the state after a specific operation within the loop.

The key variable affecting the loop condition is `move`. For the loop to execute one more time, `move` must be less than the length of `arr`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1`
- `len(arr)` is a fixed value (between 2 and 5·10^5)

For the loop to execute one more time, `move` must be less than `len(arr)`. Since `move` is initially set to `len(arr) // 2 + 1`, it is already less than `len(arr)` unless `len(arr)` is very small (e.g., 2).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time, as the condition `move < len(arr)` is already satisfied.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive, each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive. If `arr[start]` is `None`, then `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1`, and `ans` is `len(arr)`. Otherwise, if `arr[start]` is not `None`, `start` is either 0 or 1, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1`, and `ans` is either `len(arr)` or `len(arr) - 1`. If `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move - 1]`, then the value of `arr[start]` multiplied by 2 is greater than the value of `arr[move - 1]`. Otherwise, `arr[move]` is set to `None`, `start` is 1, `ans` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr[start]` is not `None`.**
