The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. This means that the elements of `arr`, which initially represent the sizes of kangaroos, will now be arranged from the smallest to the largest. The length of `arr` remains between 2 and 5·10^5, and each element in `arr` remains between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive, and each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.**
