To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition of the `while` loop: `move < len(arr)`.

### Current State:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- The length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive.
- Each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.
- If `arr[start]` is `None`, then `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, and `ans` is `len(arr)`.
- If `arr[start]` is not `None`, `start` is either 0 or 1, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, and `ans` is either `len(arr)` or `len(arr) - 1`.
- If `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move - 1]` (in the if part) or `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move]` (in the else part), then the value of `arr[start]` multiplied by 2 is greater than the respective value of `arr[move - 1]` or `arr[move]`, and the values of `start`, `move`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- Otherwise, `arr[move]` is set to `None`, `start` is 1, `ans` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr[start]` is not `None`.
- If the `else` part is executed and `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move - 2]`, then `arr[start] * 2` is greater than `arr[move - 2]`, otherwise, `arr[move - 1]` is set to `None`, `start` is 1, `ans` is `len(arr) - 2`, and `arr[start]` is not `None`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `move < len(arr)`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `move` must be less than `len(arr)`.

### Adjustments:
- The current value of `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `move` must be less than `len(arr)`.
- Since `move` is already defined as `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, we need to ensure that `len(arr) // 2 + 2` is less than `len(arr)`.

Given that `len(arr)` is at least 2, `len(arr) // 2 + 2` will always be less than `len(arr)` for any valid length of `arr` within the specified range (2 to 5·10^5). Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `move` to satisfy the loop condition.

### Final State:
Since the current state already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute one more time, we can simply repeat the state:

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5·10^5, inclusive, each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive. If `arr[start]` is `None`, then `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, and `ans` is `len(arr)`. If `arr[start]` is not `None`, `start` is either 0 or 1, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 2`, and `ans` is either `len(arr)` or `len(arr) - 1`. If `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move - 1]` (in the if part) or `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move]` (in the else part), then the value of `arr[start]` multiplied by 2 is greater than the respective value of `arr[move - 1]` or `arr[move]`, and the values of `start`, `move`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `arr[move]` is set to `None`, `start` is 1, `ans` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr[start]` is not `None`. If the `else` part is executed and `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move - 2]`, then `arr[start] * 2` is greater than `arr[move - 2]`, otherwise, `arr[move - 1]` is set to `None`, `start` is 1, `ans` is `len(arr) - 2`, and `arr[start]` is not `None`.**
