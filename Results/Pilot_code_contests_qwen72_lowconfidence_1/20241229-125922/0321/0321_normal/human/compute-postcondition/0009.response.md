The value of `move` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `move` is `len(arr) // 2`, so after incrementing, `move` becomes `len(arr) // 2 + 1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5Â·10^5, inclusive, each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1`, `ans` is `len(arr)`, and the first element of `arr` (`arr[start]`) is `None`**
