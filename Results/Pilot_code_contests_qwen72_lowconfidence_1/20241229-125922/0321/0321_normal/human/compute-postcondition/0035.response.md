The value of `start` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `arr[start]` was `None`, `start` was 0, and now it is 1. If `arr[start]` was not `None`, `start` was either 0 or 1, and now it is either 1 or 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, except for the element at index `move` which is now `None`, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5Â·10^5, inclusive, each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, except for the element at index `move` which is now `None`, if `arr[start]` is `None`, then `start` is 1, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 3`, and `ans` is `len(arr) - 1`, if `arr[start]` is not `None`, `start` is either 1 or 2, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 3`, and `ans` is either `len(arr) - 1` or `len(arr) - 2`.**
