The value of `move` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `move` was `len(arr) // 2`, so the new value of `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with `arr[move]` set to `None`, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5Â·10^5, inclusive, each element in `arr` except `arr[move]` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, `start` is 0, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1`, `ans` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr[start]` is not `None`.**
