Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the length of `arr` is between 2 and 5Â·10^5, inclusive, each element in `arr` is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, `start` is either 0 or 1, `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1`, `ans` is either `len(arr)` or `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr[start]` is not `None`. If `arr[start] * 2 > arr[move - 1]`, then `move` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1` and the value of `arr[start]` multiplied by 2 is greater than the value of `arr[move - 1]`. Otherwise, `arr[move]` is set to `None`, `start` is 1, `ans` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr[start]` is not `None`.***
