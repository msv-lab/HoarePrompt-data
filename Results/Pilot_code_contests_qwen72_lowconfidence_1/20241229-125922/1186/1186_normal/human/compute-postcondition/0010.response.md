The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` was 1 if the second character of `s` is '1', otherwise it was 0. Therefore, after incrementing `c` by 1, the new value of `c` is 2 if the second character of `s` is '1', otherwise it is 1.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N` where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`, and each character in `S` is either '0' or '1'; `s` is the input string (same as `S`); `i` is 1; `a` is the second character of `s`; `c` is 2 if the second character of `s` is '1', otherwise `c` is 1**
