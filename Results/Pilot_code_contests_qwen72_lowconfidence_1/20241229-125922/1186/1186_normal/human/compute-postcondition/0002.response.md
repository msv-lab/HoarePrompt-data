To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `S` is a string of length `N` where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`.
   - Each character in `S` is either '0' or '1'.
   - `s` is the input string, which is the same as `S`.
   - `c` is 0.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for (i, a) in enumerate(s):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `s` (which is the same as `S`) has at least one element.
   - The loop uses `enumerate(s)`, which returns pairs of `(index, value)` for each element in `s`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string.
   - Since `s` is the same as `S`, `S` must also be a non-empty string.
   - The initial value of `i` should be 0, as `enumerate` starts from index 0.
   - The initial value of `a` should be the first character of `s` (or `S`).

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `S` (and `s`) must have at least one character.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is the first character of `s` (or `S`).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`S` is a string of length `N` where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`, and each character in `S` is either '0' or '1'; `s` is the input string (same as `S`); `c` is 0; `i` is 0; `a` is the first character of `s` (or `S`)**.
