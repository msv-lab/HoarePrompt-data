The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` depends on the third character of `s` (which is the same as `S`). If the third character of `s` is '0', `c` was initially 1, and now it becomes 2. If the third character of `s` is '1', `c` was initially 1, and now it also becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N` where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`, and each character in `S` is either '0' or '1'; `s` is the input string (same as `S`); `i` is 2; `a` is the third character of `s`; `c` is 2**
