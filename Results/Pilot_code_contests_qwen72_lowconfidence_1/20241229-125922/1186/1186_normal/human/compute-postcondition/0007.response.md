The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` was 0, so after the increment, `c` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N` where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`, and each character in `S` is either '0' or '1'; `s` is the input string (same as `S`); `i` is 0; `a` is '1'; `i` is odd; `c` is 1.**
