Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N` where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`, and each character in `S` is either '0' or '1'; `s` is the input string (same as `S`); `c` is 0; `i` is 0; `a` is the first character of `s` (or `S`). The current value of `i` is 0, and the first character of `s` (or `S`) is '0'.***
