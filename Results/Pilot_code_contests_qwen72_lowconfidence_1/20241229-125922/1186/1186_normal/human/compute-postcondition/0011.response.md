Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N` where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`, and each character in `S` is either '0' or '1'; `s` is the input string (same as `S`); `i` is 1; `a` is the second character of `s`. If `i % 2 == 0` and `a == '0'`, then `c` is 1. Otherwise, `c` remains 1 if the second character of `s` is '1', and `c` is 0 if the second character of `s` is '0'.***
