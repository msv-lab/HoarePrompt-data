Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N` where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`, and each character in `S` is either '0' or '1'; `s` is the input string (same as `S`); `i` is 1; `a` is the second character of `s`. If `i % 2 == 1` and `a` is '1', then `c` is 2. Otherwise, if `i % 2 == 0` and `a` is '0', then `c` is 1. If `a` is '1', `c` remains 1. If `a` is '0', `c` is 0.***
