The function `func` does not explicitly show any parameters in its definition. However, based on the given context, it seems the function should accept a parameter `S`. `S` is a string of length `N` where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`, and each character in `S` is either '0' or '1'. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so I cannot determine the exact return value without additional details about the expected behavior of the function.

However, assuming the function processes the string `S` in some way (as implied by the parameter constraints), the general description would be:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `S` of length `N` (where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`) consisting of characters '0' or '1'. The function returns a value based on the processing of `S`, but the specific output is not provided.**
