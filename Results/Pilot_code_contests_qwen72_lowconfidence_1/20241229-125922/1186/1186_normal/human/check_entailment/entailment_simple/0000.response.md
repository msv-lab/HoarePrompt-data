Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of tiles that need to be repainted to ensure that no two adjacent tiles have the same color. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the input string `s` using `input()`. This string `s` represents the initial state of the tiles, where each character is either `0` (black) or `1` (white).

2. **Counting Repaints**:
   - The program initializes a counter `c` to 0. This counter will keep track of the number of tiles that need to be repainted to achieve the desired pattern.
   - The program then iterates over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate(s)`, which provides both the index `i` and the character `a` at that index.
   - For each character, the program checks:
     - If the index `i` is even and the character `a` is `0`, it increments the counter `c` by 1. This is because in the desired pattern, even-indexed positions should be `1` (white).
     - If the index `i` is odd and the character `a` is `1`, it increments the counter `c` by 1. This is because in the desired pattern, odd-indexed positions should be `0` (black).

3. **Calculating Minimum Repaints**:
   - After the loop, the program calculates the minimum number of repaints required by comparing `c` with `len(s) - c`.
   - The value `c` represents the number of tiles that need to be repainted to match the pattern where even-indexed positions are `1` and odd-indexed positions are `0`.
   - The value `len(s) - c` represents the number of tiles that need to be repainted to match the opposite pattern where even-indexed positions are `0` and odd-indexed positions are `1`.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two values, which is the minimum number of repaints needed to satisfy the condition.

### Why It Works:
- The program correctly considers both possible patterns (starting with `0` or starting with `1`) and chooses the one that requires fewer repaints.
- The logic ensures that no two adjacent tiles have the same color, which is the requirement of the problem.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Tile**: If the input string `s` has only one tile, the program will correctly output `0` because no repaints are needed.
- **All Black or All White**: If all tiles are initially the same color, the program will correctly calculate the minimum number of repaints needed to alternate colors.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
