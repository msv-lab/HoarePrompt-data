You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: N tiles are arranged in a row from left to right. The initial color of each tile is represented by a string S of length N.

The i-th tile from the left is painted black if the i-th character of S is `0`, and painted white if that character is `1`.

You want to repaint some of the tiles black or white, so that any two adjacent tiles have different colors.

At least how many tiles need to be repainted to satisfy the condition?

Constraints

* 1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5
* S_i is `0` or `1`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


S


Output

Print the minimum number of tiles that need to be repainted to satisfy the condition.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string of length N where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, and each character in S is either '0' or '1'.
def func():
    s = input()
    c = 0
    for (i, a) in enumerate(s):
        if i % 2 == 0 and a == '0':
            c += 1
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and a == '1':
            c += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `S` is a string of length `N` where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`, and each character in `S` is either '0' or '1'; `s` is the input string (same as `S`); `c` is the count of characters in `s` where the character at an even index is '0' or the character at an odd index is '1'.
    print(min(c, len(s) - c))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
