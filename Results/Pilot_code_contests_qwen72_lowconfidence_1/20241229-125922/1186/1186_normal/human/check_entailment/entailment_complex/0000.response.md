Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads a string `s` from standard input, which is assumed to be a valid string of length `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5) consisting of characters '0' or '1'.

2. **Counting Repaints**:
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s` using a for loop.
   - It counts the number of characters that need to be repainted to achieve a pattern where adjacent tiles have different colors.
   - Specifically, it increments the counter `c` for:
     - Characters at even indices that are '0'.
     - Characters at odd indices that are '1'.
   - This logic ensures that the program is counting the number of changes needed to make the string alternate starting with '1' at the first position.

3. **Alternative Pattern**:
   - The program also considers the alternative pattern where the first character is '0' and the rest alternate accordingly.
   - The minimum of `c` and `len(s) - c` is printed, which represents the minimum number of repaints needed to achieve either of the two alternating patterns.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For a string of length 1, the program will correctly output 0 if the string is '1' and 1 if the string is '0'.
   - The program assumes valid input, as per the problem constraints, and does not handle invalid input or empty strings, which is acceptable based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
