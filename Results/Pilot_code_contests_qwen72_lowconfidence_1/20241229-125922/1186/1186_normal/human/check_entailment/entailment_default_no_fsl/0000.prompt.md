You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: N tiles are arranged in a row from left to right. The initial color of each tile is represented by a string S of length N.

The i-th tile from the left is painted black if the i-th character of S is `0`, and painted white if that character is `1`.

You want to repaint some of the tiles black or white, so that any two adjacent tiles have different colors.

At least how many tiles need to be repainted to satisfy the condition?

Constraints

* 1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5
* S_i is `0` or `1`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


S


Output

Print the minimum number of tiles that need to be repainted to satisfy the condition.

Examples

Input

000


Output

1


Input

10010010


Output

3


Input

0


Output

0
Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    c = 0
    for (i, a) in enumerate(s):
        if i % 2 == 0 and a == '0':
            c += 1
        if i % 2 == 1 and a == '1':
            c += 1
    print(min(c, len(s) - c))


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads a string `S` from the input, where `S` is a string of length `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5) consisting of characters '0' or '1'. It then counts the number of positions in `S` where the character at an even index is '0' or the character at an odd index is '1'. Finally, it prints the minimum of this count and the total number of characters in `S` minus this count. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include strings of length 1, where the function will always print 0 if the string is '1' and 1 if the string is '0'. Additionally, if the string is empty, the function will raise an error because it expects input.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
