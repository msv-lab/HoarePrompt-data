Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tiles that need to be repainted to ensure that no two adjacent tiles have the same color. The function reads a string `S` from the input and iterates through each character, counting the number of positions where the character at an even index is '0' or the character at an odd index is '1'. This count, `c`, represents one of the two possible patterns needed to achieve the alternating color requirement. The function then prints the minimum of `c` and the total number of characters in `S` minus `c`, which ensures that the other pattern (where even indices are '1' and odd indices are '0') is also considered. This approach guarantees that the minimum number of repaints is calculated correctly for any valid input string `S` of length between 1 and 10^5, including edge cases like strings of length 1. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
