Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program works correctly by considering two possible patterns for the final arrangement of tiles: starting with a black tile (0) and starting with a white tile (1). For each pattern, it counts the number of changes needed to match the pattern and then outputs the minimum of these two counts.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads the input string `s`.
2. It initializes a counter `c` to zero.
3. It iterates over the string `s` using its index `i` and value `a`.
   - If the index `i` is even and the character `a` is `0`, it increments the counter `c`. This means that in the pattern starting with `0`, this position is already correct.
   - If the index `i` is odd and the character `a` is `1`, it also increments the counter `c`. This means that in the pattern starting with `0`, this position is already correct.
4. After the loop, it prints the minimum of `c` and `len(s) - c`. The value `len(s) - c` represents the number of changes needed if the pattern starts with `1`.

This approach ensures that the program considers both possible patterns and chooses the one that requires the fewest changes. Therefore, the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
