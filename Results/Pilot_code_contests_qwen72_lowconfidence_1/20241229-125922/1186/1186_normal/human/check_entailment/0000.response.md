Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of tiles that need to be repainted to ensure that no two adjacent tiles have the same color. It does this by considering two possible patterns for the tiles: one where the tiles alternate starting with a black tile (`0`), and another where they alternate starting with a white tile (`1`). The program counts the number of changes needed for each pattern and prints the smaller of the two counts. This approach covers all possible cases within the constraints, ensuring that the solution is optimal for any valid input string `S`.
