You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Polycarp found a rectangular table consisting of n rows and m columns. He noticed that each cell of the table has its number, obtained by the following algorithm "by columns": 

  * cells are numbered starting from one; 
  * cells are numbered from left to right by columns, and inside each column from top to bottom; 
  * number of each cell is an integer one greater than in the previous cell. 



For example, if n = 3 and m = 5, the table will be numbered as follows:

$$$ \begin{matrix} 1 & 4 & 7 & 10 & 13 \\\ 2 & 5 & 8 & 11 & 14 \\\ 3 & 6 & 9 & 12 & 15 \\\ \end{matrix} $$$

However, Polycarp considers such numbering inconvenient. He likes the numbering "by rows": 

  * cells are numbered starting from one; 
  * cells are numbered from top to bottom by rows, and inside each row from left to right; 
  * number of each cell is an integer one greater than the number of the previous cell. 



For example, if n = 3 and m = 5, then Polycarp likes the following table numbering: $$$ \begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\ 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\ 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 \\\ \end{matrix} $$$

Polycarp doesn't have much time, so he asks you to find out what would be the cell number in the numbering "by rows", if in the numbering "by columns" the cell has the number x?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of a single line containing three integers n, m, x (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ x ≤ n ⋅ m), where n and m are the number of rows and columns in the table, and x is the cell number.

Note that the numbers in some test cases do not fit into the 32-bit integer type, so you must use at least the 64-bit integer type of your programming language.

Output

For each test case, output the cell number in the numbering "by rows".

Program:

        test_count += 1
