The function `func_2` accepts a function object `f` and an optional list `stack` (which defaults to an empty list). It returns a function object `wrapped_func`. However, the actual implementation of `wrapped_func` is missing, meaning the function as written does not create or define `wrapped_func`. As a result, the function will raise a `NameError` when executed because `wrapped_func` is referenced but never defined. In a correct implementation, `wrapped_func` would presumably be a new function that wraps or modifies the behavior of `f` in some way, possibly using the `stack` parameter. From the user's perspective, the function is intended to return a new function object, but in its current form, it will fail due to the undefined `wrapped_func`.
