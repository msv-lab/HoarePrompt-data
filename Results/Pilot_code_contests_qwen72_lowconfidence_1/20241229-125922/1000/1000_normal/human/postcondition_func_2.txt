The function `wrapped_func` is designed to handle the execution of another function `f` with given arguments. If `f` returns a generator, `wrapped_func` will iterate through the generator, handling any values yielded until the generator is exhausted. The final state of the program after the function concludes is as follows: 

- If `stack` is initially non-empty, the function returns the result of calling `f` with the arguments `*args` and `
