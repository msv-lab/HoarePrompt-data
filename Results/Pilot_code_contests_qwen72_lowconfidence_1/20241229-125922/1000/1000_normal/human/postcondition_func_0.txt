The function `func_1` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`). It writes the string representations of the positional arguments to a specified file-like object, separated by the string `sep` (defaulting to a single space). After writing all arguments, it appends the string `end` (defaulting to a newline character) to the output. If the `flush` keyword argument is `True`, the buffer of the file-like object is flushed. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is such that the `args` tuple remains unchanged, and the `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the keys `'sep'`, `'file'`, and `'end'` if they were present. If `args` is empty, nothing is written except the `end` string. If `file` is not specified, the output is directed to `sys.stdout`.
