The function `wrapped_func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the context, it seems to involve a call to another function `f` with some arguments (`*args`) and a generator that produces a final value `to`. 

Given the information:

- **Case_1**: The function returns the result of calling another function `f` with some arguments.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the final value of `to`, which is the value returned by the generator or the last send operation during the loop's execution.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `wrapped_func` is as follows:

Functionality: **The function `wrapped_func` returns the result of calling another function `f` with some arguments (Case_1). Alternatively, it returns the final value of `to`, which is the value returned by the generator or the last send operation during the loop's execution (Case_2).**
