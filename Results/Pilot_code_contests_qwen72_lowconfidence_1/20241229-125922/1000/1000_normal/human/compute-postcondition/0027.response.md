The code `continue` does not change any variable values but affects the flow of control in a loop, causing the current iteration to end and the next iteration to begin immediately. Since no variables are updated by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the loop control flow is impacted.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n * m, the stack is [to], `to` is the next value from the iterator `f(*args)`, the loop continues to the next iteration.**
