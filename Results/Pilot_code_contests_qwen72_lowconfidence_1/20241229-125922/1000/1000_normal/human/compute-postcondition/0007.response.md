The value of `to` is updated by calling the `next()` function on the generator object `to`. This advances the generator to its next value and assigns this value back to `to`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n * m, the stack is [to], `to` is the next value from the generator.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n * m, the stack is [to], `to` is the next value from the generator.**
