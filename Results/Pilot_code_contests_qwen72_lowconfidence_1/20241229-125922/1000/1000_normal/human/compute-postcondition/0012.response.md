Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n * m, the stack is empty, `to` is the result of the function call `f(*args)`, and if `type(to)` is `GeneratorType`, the current iteration is skipped. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
