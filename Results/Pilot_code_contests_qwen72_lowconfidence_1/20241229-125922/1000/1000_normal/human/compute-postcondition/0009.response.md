Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n * m, the stack is empty, and `to` is the result of the function call `f(*args)`. If `type(to)` is `GeneratorType`, the stack is `[to]`, `to` is the next value from the generator, and the current iteration is skipped.***
