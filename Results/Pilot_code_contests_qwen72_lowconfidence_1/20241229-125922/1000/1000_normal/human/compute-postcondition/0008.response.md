The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n * m, the stack is [to], `to` is the next value from the generator, and the current iteration is skipped.**
