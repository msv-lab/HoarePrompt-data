Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n * m, and the stack is empty. If `not stack` is true (i.e., the stack is empty), `to` is the result of the function call `f(*args)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
