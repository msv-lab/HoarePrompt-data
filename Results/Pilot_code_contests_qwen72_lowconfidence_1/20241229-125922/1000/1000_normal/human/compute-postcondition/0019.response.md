Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n * m, the stack is empty, `to` is the result of the function call `f(*args)`. If `type(to)` is `GeneratorType`, the current iteration is skipped and `to` is the next value yielded by the generator `f(*args)`. Otherwise, the stack remains empty and the function continues to the next statement.***
