For a `while True:` loop, the condition is always true, and thus the loop will continue to execute unless there is a specific mechanism within the loop (such as a `break` statement) that stops it. Since the loop condition does not depend on the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, the state of the stack, or the value of `to`, these variables do not need to be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time. The loop will execute again regardless of the current state of these variables.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n * m, the stack is empty, and `to` is the result of the function call `f(*args)`**
