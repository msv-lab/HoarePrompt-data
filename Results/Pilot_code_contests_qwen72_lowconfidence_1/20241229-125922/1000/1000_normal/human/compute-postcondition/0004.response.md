For the given task, the `while` loop is set to `True`, meaning it is an infinite loop and will always execute unless there is a break statement inside the loop. Since the loop condition is always true, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n * m, the stack is empty, `to` is the result of the function call `f(*args)`**
