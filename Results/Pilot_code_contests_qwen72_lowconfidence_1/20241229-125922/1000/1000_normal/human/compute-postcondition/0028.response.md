Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n * m, the stack is initially empty. If `type(to)` is `GeneratorType`, the stack is `[to]`, `to` is the next value from the iterator `f(*args)`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the stack remains empty and `to` retains the result of the function call `f(*args)`.***
