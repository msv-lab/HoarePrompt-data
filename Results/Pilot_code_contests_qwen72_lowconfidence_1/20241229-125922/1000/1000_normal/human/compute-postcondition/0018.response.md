The code snippet `continue` is used within loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. In the context provided:

- The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The generator `to` has already been advanced to its next yield point by the previous line `to = next(to)`.
- The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration, meaning no further changes to the variables occur in this iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the table, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n * m, the stack contains `to`, `to` is the next value yielded by the generator `f(*args)`, and the current iteration is skipped.**
