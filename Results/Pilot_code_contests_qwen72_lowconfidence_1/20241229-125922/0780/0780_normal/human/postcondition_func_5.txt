The function `func_6` reads a line from standard input (stdin) and returns it after stripping any leading and trailing whitespace. If no input is available, the function will block (wait) until input is provided. If the input is empty or consists only of whitespace, the function will return an empty string. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state beyond reading from stdin.
