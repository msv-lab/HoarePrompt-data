The function `func_7` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function correctly handles the case where one or both of the input parameters are zero, returning the non-zero value or zero if both are zero. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.
