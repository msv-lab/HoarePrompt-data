The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns two lists, `fact` and `ifact`. The list `fact` contains the first 5005 factorials modulo `mod`, starting from 0! (which is 1) up to 5004!. The list `ifact` contains the modular multiplicative inverses of the factorials in `fact` modulo `mod`. Specifically, `ifact[5004]` is the modular inverse of `fact[5004]`, and for each index `k` from 5003 down to 0, `ifact[k]` is `(k + 1) * ifact[k + 1] % mod`. The function assumes that `mod` is a prime number, which is necessary for the modular inverse calculation using Fermat's Little Theorem. If `mod` is not a prime number, the function may produce incorrect results.
