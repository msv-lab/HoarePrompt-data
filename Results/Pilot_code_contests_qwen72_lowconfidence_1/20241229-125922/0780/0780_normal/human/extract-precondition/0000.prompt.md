You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Slime has a sequence of positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n.

In one operation Orac can choose an arbitrary subsegment [l … r] of this sequence and replace all values a_l, a_{l + 1}, …, a_r to the value of median of \\{a_l, a_{l + 1}, …, a_r\}.

In this problem, for the integer multiset s, the median of s is equal to the ⌊ (|s|+1)/(2)⌋-th smallest number in it. For example, the median of \{1,4,4,6,5\} is 4, and the median of \{1,7,5,8\} is 5.

Slime wants Orac to make a_1 = a_2 = … = a_n = k using these operations.

Orac thinks that it is impossible, and he does not want to waste his time, so he decided to ask you if it is possible to satisfy the Slime's requirement, he may ask you these questions several times.

Input

The first line of the input is a single integer t: the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers n\ (1≤ n≤ 100 000) and k\ (1≤ k≤ 10^9), the second line contains n positive integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n\ (1≤ a_i≤ 10^9)

The total sum of n is at most 100 000.

Output

The output should contain t lines. The i-th line should be equal to 'yes' if it is possible to make all integers k in some number of operations or 'no', otherwise. You can print each letter in lowercase or uppercase.

Example

Input


5
5 3
1 5 2 6 1
1 6
6
3 2
1 2 3
4 3
3 1 2 3
10 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


Output


no
yes
yes
no
yes

Note

In the first query, Orac can't turn all elements into 3.

In the second query, a_1=6 is already satisfied.

In the third query, Orac can select the complete array and turn all elements into 2.

In the fourth query, Orac can't turn all elements into 3.

In the fifth query, Orac can select [1,6] at first and then select [2,10].
Program:
```
def func_11():
    t = int(func_6())
    while t:
        (n, k) = func_4()
        Arr = func_5() + [0, 0, 0]
        flag1 = flag2 = 0
        if n == 1:
            if Arr[0] == k:
                print('yes')
            else:
                print('no')
            t -= 1
            continue
        for i in range(n):
            if Arr[i] == k:
                flag1 = 1
            if Arr[i] >= k:
                if Arr[i + 1] >= k or Arr[i + 2] >= k:
                    flag2 = 1
        if flag1 and flag2:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        t -= 1
```
