You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Slime has a sequence of positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n.

In one operation Orac can choose an arbitrary subsegment [l … r] of this sequence and replace all values a_l, a_{l + 1}, …, a_r to the value of median of \\{a_l, a_{l + 1}, …, a_r\}.

In this problem, for the integer multiset s, the median of s is equal to the ⌊ (|s|+1)/(2)⌋-th smallest number in it. For example, the median of \{1,4,4,6,5\} is 4, and the median of \{1,7,5,8\} is 5.

Slime wants Orac to make a_1 = a_2 = … = a_n = k using these operations.

Orac thinks that it is impossible, and he does not want to waste his time, so he decided to ask you if it is possible to satisfy the Slime's requirement, he may ask you these questions several times.

Input

The first line of the input is a single integer t: the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers n\ (1≤ n≤ 100 000) and k\ (1≤ k≤ 10^9), the second line contains n positive integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n\ (1≤ a_i≤ 10^9)

The total sum of n is at most 100 000.

Output

The output should contain t lines. The i-th line should be equal to 'yes' if it is possible to make all integers k in some number of operations or 'no', otherwise. You can print each letter in lowercase or uppercase.

Example

Input


5
5 3
1 5 2 6 1
1 6
6
3 2
1 2 3
4 3
3 1 2 3
10 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


Output


no
yes
yes
no
yes

Note

In the first query, Orac can't turn all elements into 3.

In the second query, a_1=6 is already satisfied.

In the third query, Orac can select the complete array and turn all elements into 2.

In the fourth query, Orac can't turn all elements into 3.

In the fifth query, Orac can select [1,6] at first and then select [2,10].

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program adds extra zeros to the end of the array `Arr` using `Arr = func_5() + [0, 0, 0]`. This can lead to incorrect results because the added zeros can affect the logic used to check the conditions for making all elements equal to `k`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Subsegments**: The program checks if there exists an element `Arr[i]` such that `Arr[i] == k` and if there are two consecutive elements `Arr[i]` and `Arr[i+1]` (or `Arr[i+2]`) that are greater than or equal to `k`. However, this logic is insufficient to determine if the entire array can be transformed to all `k` values. The median operation can change the values in a more complex way, and simply checking adjacent elements is not enough.

3. **Median Calculation**: The program does not actually calculate the median of the subsegments. It only checks if there are elements greater than or equal to `k` and if there is at least one element equal to `k`. This does not ensure that the median of any subsegment can be made equal to `k`.

4. **Single Element Case**: The program handles the single-element case correctly, but this is a trivial case and does not cover the more complex scenarios.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3 4
1 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
yes
```

**Actual Output:**
```
no
```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs `no` because it does not correctly handle the transformation of the array to all `4`s. The correct approach would involve more sophisticated logic to ensure that the median operation can transform the array as required.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 11 : The function `func_11` processes a series of queries, each defined by a positive integer `n` and a positive integer `k`. For each query, it checks a list `Arr` of `n` positive integers (extended by three zeros at the end). The function prints 'yes' if there is at least one element in `Arr` that equals `k` and there exists an index `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all queries, the variable `t` is 0, and the last values of `n`, `k`, and `Arr` are retained. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include when `n` is 1, in which case the function only checks if the single element in `Arr` equals `k`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
