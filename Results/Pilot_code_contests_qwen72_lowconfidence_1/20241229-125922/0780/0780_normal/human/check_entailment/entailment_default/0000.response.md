Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_11` does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic used to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to `k` using the specified operations is flawed.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling Single Element Arrays**:
   - The function correctly handles the case when `n == 1` and checks if the single element is equal to `k`.

2. **General Case Logic**:
   - The function uses two flags, `flag1` and `flag2`, to determine if it is possible to make all elements equal to `k`.
   - `flag1` is set if there is at least one element in `Arr` that equals `k`.
   - `flag2` is set if there exists an index `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`.
   - This logic is insufficient because it does not consider the possibility of making all elements equal to `k` through multiple operations. The function only checks for a specific pattern that may not cover all valid scenarios.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
1
4 3
1 2 4 5
```
- The function will set `flag1` to 0 because there is no element equal to 3.
- The function will set `flag2` to 1 because there is an index `i = 2` where `Arr[2] = 4` and `Arr[3] = 5`, both of which are greater than or equal to 3.
- The function will print 'no' because `flag1` is 0.

However, it is possible to make all elements equal to 3 through the following operations:
1. Select the subarray `[1, 2, 4]` and replace it with the median 2.
2. Select the subarray `[2, 2, 5]` and replace it with the median 2.
3. Select the subarray `[2, 2, 2]` and replace it with the median 2.
4. Finally, select the entire array and replace it with the median 3.

Thus, the function incorrectly determines that it is not possible to make all elements equal to 3.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_11` does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
