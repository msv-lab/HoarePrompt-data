You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Slime has a sequence of positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n.

In one operation Orac can choose an arbitrary subsegment [l … r] of this sequence and replace all values a_l, a_{l + 1}, …, a_r to the value of median of \\{a_l, a_{l + 1}, …, a_r\}.

In this problem, for the integer multiset s, the median of s is equal to the ⌊ (|s|+1)/(2)⌋-th smallest number in it. For example, the median of \{1,4,4,6,5\} is 4, and the median of \{1,7,5,8\} is 5.

Slime wants Orac to make a_1 = a_2 = … = a_n = k using these operations.

Orac thinks that it is impossible, and he does not want to waste his time, so he decided to ask you if it is possible to satisfy the Slime's requirement, he may ask you these questions several times.

Input

The first line of the input is a single integer t: the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers n\ (1≤ n≤ 100 000) and k\ (1≤ k≤ 10^9), the second line contains n positive integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n\ (1≤ a_i≤ 10^9)

The total sum of n is at most 100 000.

Output

The output should contain t lines. The i-th line should be equal to 'yes' if it is possible to make all integers k in some number of operations or 'no', otherwise. You can print each letter in lowercase or uppercase.

Example

Input


5
5 3
1 5 2 6 1
1 6
6
3 2
1 2 3
4 3
3 1 2 3
10 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


Output


no
yes
yes
no
yes

Note

In the first query, Orac can't turn all elements into 3.

In the second query, a_1=6 is already satisfied.

In the third query, Orac can select the complete array and turn all elements into 2.

In the fourth query, Orac can't turn all elements into 3.

In the fifth query, Orac can select [1,6] at first and then select [2,10].

        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
    return (fact, ifact)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns two lists, `fact` and `ifact`. The list `fact` contains the first 5005 factorials modulo `mod`, starting from 0! (which is 1) up to 5004!. The list `ifact` contains the modular multiplicative inverses of the factorials in `fact` modulo `mod`. Specifically, `ifact[5004]` is the modular inverse of `fact[5004]`, and for each index `k` from 5003 down to 0, `ifact[k]` is `(k + 1) * ifact[k + 1] % mod`. The function assumes that `mod` is a prime number, which is necessary for the modular inverse calculation using Fermat's Little Theorem. If `mod` is not a prime number, the function may produce incorrect results.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is an integer not divisible by `p`, and `p` is a prime number. It returns the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` modulo `p`, which is an integer `x` such that `(n * x) % p = 1`. If `n` is divisible by `p` or `p` is not a prime number, the function's behavior is undefined and may result in incorrect output or an error.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, r, fact, ifact):
    t = fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod
    return t
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `n`, `r`, `fact`, and `ifact`. It calculates and returns the value `t` using the formula `fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod`. Here, `n` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= r <= n`, `fact` is a list where `fact[i]` represents the factorial of `i`, and `ifact` is a list where `ifact[i]` represents the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of `i` under a certain modulus `mod`. The function assumes that the `fact` and `ifact` lists are precomputed and valid for the given `n` and `r`. If the lists are not properly initialized or if `n` or `r` are out of bounds, the function may raise an `IndexError`. The final state of the program is that the function returns the computed value `t`, which represents the binomial coefficient `C(n, r)` modulo `mod`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line by whitespace into individual components, converts each component into an integer, and returns an iterator of these integers. The function assumes that the input consists of space-separated integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion process. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input has been processed and an iterator of integers is returned, ready for further use in the calling context.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` reads a single line of input from standard input, expecting a line of space-separated integers. It then converts these strings into integers and returns them as a list. If the input line is empty or contains non-integer values, the function will either return an empty list or raise a ValueError, respectively.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` reads a line from standard input (stdin) and returns it after stripping any leading and trailing whitespace. If no input is available, the function will block (wait) until input is provided. If the input is empty or consists only of whitespace, the function will return an empty string. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state beyond reading from stdin.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function correctly handles the case where one or both of the input parameters are zero, returning the non-zero value or zero if both are zero. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x, y):
    return x * y // func_7(x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It returns the integer result of `(x * y)` divided by the value returned from the function `func_7(x, y)`. If `func_7(x, y)` returns zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will be raised. The function assumes that `func_7(x, y)` returns a non-zero integer.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n):
    return [n, 1, n + 1, 0][n % 4]
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the remainder when `n` is divided by 4. Specifically, it returns one of the following values:
- `n` if `n % 4 == 0`
- `1` if `n % 4 == 1`
- `n + 1` if `n % 4 == 2`
- `0` if `n % 4 == 3`

The function does not modify any external state or variables and always returns one of these four values based on the input `n`. The function handles all non-negative integers, including `0`, and the returned value is determined solely by the remainder of `n` when divided by 4.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(a, b):
    res = 1
    while b:
        if b & 1:
            res = res * a
            b -= 1
        else:
            a = a * a
            b >>= 1
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` takes two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is a positive integer and `b` is a non-negative integer. It computes and returns `a` raised to the power of `b`. After the function concludes, `b` is reduced to 0, and the returned value is `a^b`. This function correctly handles all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    t = int(func_6())
    while t:
        (n, k) = func_4()
        Arr = func_5() + [0, 0, 0]
        flag1 = flag2 = 0
        if n == 1:
            if Arr[0] == k:
                print('yes')
            else:
                print('no')
            t -= 1
            continue
        for i in range(n):
            if Arr[i] == k:
                flag1 = 1
            if Arr[i] >= k:
                if Arr[i + 1] >= k or Arr[i + 2] >= k:
                    flag2 = 1
        if flag1 and flag2:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        t -= 1
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` processes a series of queries, each defined by a positive integer `n` and a positive integer `k`. For each query, it checks a list `Arr` of `n` positive integers (extended by three zeros at the end). The function prints 'yes' if there is at least one element in `Arr` that equals `k` and there exists an index `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all queries, the variable `t` is 0, and the last values of `n`, `k`, and `Arr` are retained. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include when `n` is 1, in which case the function only checks if the single element in `Arr` equals `k`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
