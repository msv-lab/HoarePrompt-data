Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code provided does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the logic used to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to `k` using the described operations is flawed.

### Issue Analysis:

1. **Flag Logic**:
   - The code uses two flags, `flag1` and `flag2`, to determine if it is possible to make all elements equal to `k`.
   - `flag1` is set to 1 if any element in the array is equal to `k`.
   - `flag2` is set to 1 if there exists an index `i` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The condition `Arr[i + 1] >= k or Arr[i + 2] >= k` is insufficient to ensure that the median of any subarray can be made equal to `k`.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`. The current logic would set `flag2` to 1 because `Arr[2] >= k` and `Arr[3] >= k`, but it is impossible to make all elements equal to 3 using the median operation.

3. **Median Operation**:
   - The median operation requires that there are enough elements greater than or equal to `k` in any subarray to ensure the median can be `k`.
   - The current logic does not account for the fact that the median of a subarray must be `k` for the entire array to be transformed to `k`.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
```
- The current code would set `flag1` to 1 because `3` is in the array.
- The current code would set `flag2` to 1 because `Arr[2] >= k` and `Arr[3] >= k`.
- However, it is impossible to make all elements equal to `3` using the median operation, as the median of any subarray that includes `1` and `2` cannot be `3`.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly those where the median operation cannot achieve the desired result even though the flags are set. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
