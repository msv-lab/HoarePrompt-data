Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input and Handling Multiple Queries**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the sequence `Arr`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `n == 1`, the program checks if the single element in the sequence is equal to `k` and prints 'yes' or 'no' accordingly.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program uses two flags, `flag1` and `flag2`, to determine if the sequence can be transformed to have all elements equal to `k`.
   - `flag1` is set to 1 if any element in the sequence is equal to `k`.
   - `flag2` is set to 1 if there exists an index `i` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program checks if both `flag1` and `flag2` are 1. If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

5. **Additional Zeros**:
   - The program appends three zeros to the end of the sequence `Arr`. This ensures that the indices `i + 1` and `i + 2` are always within bounds during the loop, simplifying the logic without affecting the correctness.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly determines if it is possible to make all elements in the sequence equal to `k` by performing the specified operations.
   - The conditions for `flag1` and `flag2` ensure that the sequence can be transformed as required by the problem description.

Given the above points, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
