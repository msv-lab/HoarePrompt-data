You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Slime has a sequence of positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n.

In one operation Orac can choose an arbitrary subsegment [l … r] of this sequence and replace all values a_l, a_{l + 1}, …, a_r to the value of median of \\{a_l, a_{l + 1}, …, a_r\}.

In this problem, for the integer multiset s, the median of s is equal to the ⌊ (|s|+1)/(2)⌋-th smallest number in it. For example, the median of \{1,4,4,6,5\} is 4, and the median of \{1,7,5,8\} is 5.

Slime wants Orac to make a_1 = a_2 = … = a_n = k using these operations.

Orac thinks that it is impossible, and he does not want to waste his time, so he decided to ask you if it is possible to satisfy the Slime's requirement, he may ask you these questions several times.

Input

The first line of the input is a single integer t: the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers n\ (1≤ n≤ 100 000) and k\ (1≤ k≤ 10^9), the second line contains n positive integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n\ (1≤ a_i≤ 10^9)

The total sum of n is at most 100 000.

Output

The output should contain t lines. The i-th line should be equal to 'yes' if it is possible to make all integers k in some number of operations or 'no', otherwise. You can print each letter in lowercase or uppercase.

Example

Input


5
5 3
1 5 2 6 1
1 6
6
3 2
1 2 3
4 3
3 1 2 3
10 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


Output


no
yes
yes
no
yes

Note

In the first query, Orac can't turn all elements into 3.

In the second query, a_1=6 is already satisfied.

In the third query, Orac can select the complete array and turn all elements into 2.

In the fourth query, Orac can't turn all elements into 3.

In the fifth query, Orac can select [1,6] at first and then select [2,10].

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    fact = [1]
    for i in range(1, 5005):
        fact.append(fact[-1] * i % mod)
    ifact = [0] * 5005
    ifact[5004] = pow(fact[5004], mod - 2, mod)
    for i in range(5004, 0, -1):
        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
    return (fact, ifact)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns two lists, `fact` and `ifact`. The list `fact` contains the first 5005 factorials modulo `mod`, starting from 0! (which is 1) up to 5004!. The list `ifact` contains the modular multiplicative inverses of the factorials in `fact` modulo `mod`. Specifically, `ifact[5004]` is the modular inverse of `fact[5004]`, and for each index `k` from 5003 down to 0, `ifact[k]` is `(k + 1) * ifact[k + 1] % mod`. The function assumes that `mod` is a prime number, which is necessary for the modular inverse calculation using Fermat's Little Theorem. If `mod` is not a prime number, the function may produce incorrect results.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is an integer not divisible by `p`, and `p` is a prime number. It returns the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` modulo `p`, which is an integer `x` such that `(n * x) % p = 1`. If `n` is divisible by `p` or `p` is not a prime number, the function's behavior is undefined and may result in incorrect output or an error.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, r, fact, ifact):
    t = fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod
    return t
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `n`, `r`, `fact`, and `ifact`. It calculates and returns the value `t` using the formula `fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod`. Here, `n` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= r <= n`, `fact` is a list where `fact[i]` represents the factorial of `i`, and `ifact` is a list where `ifact[i]` represents the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of `i` under a certain modulus `mod`. The function assumes that the `fact` and `ifact` lists are precomputed and valid for the given `n` and `r`. If the lists are not properly initialized or if `n` or `r` are out of bounds, the function may raise an `IndexError`. The final state of the program is that the function returns the computed value `t`, which represents the binomial coefficient `C(n, r)` modulo `mod`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line by whitespace into individual components, converts each component into an integer, and returns an iterator of these integers. The function assumes that the input consists of space-separated integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion process. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input has been processed and an iterator of integers is returned, ready for further use in the calling context.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` reads a single line of input from standard input, expecting a line of space-separated integers. It then converts these strings into integers and returns them as a list. If the input line is empty or contains non-integer values, the function will either return an empty list or raise a ValueError, respectively.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` reads a line from standard input (stdin) and returns it after stripping any leading and trailing whitespace. If no input is available, the function will block (wait) until input is provided. If the input is empty or consists only of whitespace, the function will return an empty string. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state beyond reading from stdin.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function correctly handles the case where one or both of the input parameters are zero, returning the non-zero value or zero if both are zero. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x, y):
    return x * y // func_7(x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It returns the integer result of `(x * y)` divided by the value returned from the function `func_7(x, y)`. If `func_7(x, y)` returns zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will be raised. The function assumes that `func_7(x, y)` returns a non-zero integer.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n):
    return [n, 1, n + 1, 0][n % 4]
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the remainder when `n` is divided by 4. Specifically, it returns one of the following values:
- `n` if `n % 4 == 0`
- `1` if `n % 4 == 1`
- `n + 1` if `n % 4 == 2`
- `0` if `n % 4 == 3`

The function does not modify any external state or variables and always returns one of these four values based on the input `n`. The function handles all non-negative integers, including `0`, and the returned value is determined solely by the remainder of `n` when divided by 4.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(a, b):
    res = 1
    while b:
        if b & 1:
            res = res * a
            b -= 1
        else:
            a = a * a
            b >>= 1
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` takes two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is a positive integer and `b` is a non-negative integer. It computes and returns `a` raised to the power of `b`. After the function concludes, `b` is reduced to 0, and the returned value is `a^b`. This function correctly handles all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    t = int(func_6())
    while t:
        (n, k) = func_4()
        Arr = func_5() + [0, 0, 0]
        flag1 = flag2 = 0
        if n == 1:
            if Arr[0] == k:
                print('yes')
            else:
                print('no')
            t -= 1
            continue
        for i in range(n):
            if Arr[i] == k:
                flag1 = 1
            if Arr[i] >= k:
                if Arr[i + 1] >= k or Arr[i + 2] >= k:
                    flag2 = 1
        if flag1 and flag2:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        t -= 1
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` processes a series of queries, each defined by a positive integer `n` and a positive integer `k`. For each query, it checks a list `Arr` of `n` positive integers (extended by three zeros at the end). The function prints 'yes' if there is at least one element in `Arr` that equals `k` and there exists an index `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all queries, the variable `t` is 0, and the last values of `n`, `k`, and `Arr` are retained. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include when `n` is 1, in which case the function only checks if the single element in `Arr` equals `k`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
