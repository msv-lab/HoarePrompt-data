Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_11` does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to determine if it is possible to make all elements in the array equal to `k` is flawed. The current implementation checks if there is at least one element in `Arr` that equals `k` and if there exists an index `i` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`. However, this logic does not correctly capture the requirement that it is possible to make all elements in the array equal to `k` using the median operation.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
yes
```

**Actual Output:**
The function will output `no`.

**Explanation:**
- The array is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The target value `k` is `2`.
- According to the problem, we can select the entire array `[1, 2, 3]` and replace all elements with the median, which is `2`. Thus, the array becomes `[2, 2, 2]`, and the condition is satisfied.

However, the current implementation will set `flag1` to `1` because there is an element equal to `k` (the element `2`). It will also set `flag2` to `1` because there is an element `2` followed by `3` (both greater than or equal to `k`). But it will still output `no` because it does not correctly handle the case where the median operation can be used to achieve the desired result.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_11` does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
