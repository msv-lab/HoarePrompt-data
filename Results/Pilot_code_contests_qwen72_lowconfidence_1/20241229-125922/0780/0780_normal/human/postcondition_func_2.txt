The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `n`, `r`, `fact`, and `ifact`. It calculates and returns the value `t` using the formula `fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod`. Here, `n` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= r <= n`, `fact` is a list where `fact[i]` represents the factorial of `i`, and `ifact` is a list where `ifact[i]` represents the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of `i` under a certain modulus `mod`. The function assumes that the `fact` and `ifact` lists are precomputed and valid for the given `n` and `r`. If the lists are not properly initialized or if `n` or `r` are out of bounds, the function may raise an `IndexError`. The final state of the program is that the function returns the computed value `t`, which represents the binomial coefficient `C(n, r)` modulo `mod`.
