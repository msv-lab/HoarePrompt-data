The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is an integer not divisible by `p`, and `p` is a prime number. It returns the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` modulo `p`, which is an integer `x` such that `(n * x) % p = 1`. If `n` is divisible by `p` or `p` is not a prime number, the function's behavior is undefined and may result in incorrect output or an error.
