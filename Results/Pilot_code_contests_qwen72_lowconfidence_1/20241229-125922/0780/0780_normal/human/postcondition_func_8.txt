The function `func_9` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the remainder when `n` is divided by 4. Specifically, it returns one of the following values:
- `n` if `n % 4 == 0`
- `1` if `n % 4 == 1`
- `n + 1` if `n % 4 == 2`
- `0` if `n % 4 == 3`

The function does not modify any external state or variables and always returns one of these four values based on the input `n`. The function handles all non-negative integers, including `0`, and the returned value is determined solely by the remainder of `n` when divided by 4.
