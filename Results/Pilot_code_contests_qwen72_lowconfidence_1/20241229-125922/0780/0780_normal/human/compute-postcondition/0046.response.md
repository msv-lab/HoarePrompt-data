The code snippet `print('yes')` only prints the string 'yes' to the console and does not alter any variables or states within the program. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0**
