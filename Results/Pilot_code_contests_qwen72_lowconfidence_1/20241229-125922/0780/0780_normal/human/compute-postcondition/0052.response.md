To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1.
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`.
- `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`.
- The length of `Arr` is `n + 3`.
- `flag1` is 0.
- `flag2` is 0.
- If `n == 1`, `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2.
- If `Arr[0] == k` or `Arr[0] != k`, no changes are made to the variables.

### Loop Condition:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n > 0`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `k`, `Arr`, `flag1`, `flag2`) do not directly affect the loop condition, but they are part of the initial state and should be included in the final state.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0. The other variables should remain as they are.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1 (or minus 2 if `n == 1`), `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0, `i` is 0**
