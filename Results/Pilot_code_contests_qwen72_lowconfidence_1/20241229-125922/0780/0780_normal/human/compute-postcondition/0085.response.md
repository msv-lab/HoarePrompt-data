The code snippet provided only includes a print statement, which does not alter any of the variables in the current state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is the first value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0.**
