Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` is 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `4`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0. If `Arr[0]` is equal to `k`, 'yes' is printed to the console. Otherwise, `Arr[0]` is not equal to `k`.***
