Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`. After the loop finishes executing: `flag1` is 1 if any element in `Arr[0:n]` is equal to `k`; otherwise, `flag1` is 0. `flag2` is 1 if any element in `Arr[0:n]` is greater than or equal to `k` and there exists an index `i` such that `Arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `k` and either `Arr[i + 1]` or `Arr[i + 2]` (if they exist) is also greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `flag2` is 0.**
