The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The conditions regarding `Arr[0]` being equal or not equal to `k` do not affect the execution of the code snippet since the code snippet only modifies `t`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0. If `Arr[0] == k`, no changes are made to the variables. If `Arr[0] != k`, no changes are made to the variables.**
