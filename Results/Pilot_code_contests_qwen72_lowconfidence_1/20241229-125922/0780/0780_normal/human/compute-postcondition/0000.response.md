The value of `t` is updated by the result of the function call `func_6()`. Since `func_6()` returns an integer, `t` is now an integer. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `Arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `Arr` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 10^9, and the length of `Arr` is n + 3 due to the addition of three zeros at the end.**
