Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is the first value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0. If `Arr[0] == k`, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state also remains unchanged.***
