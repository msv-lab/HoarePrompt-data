Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the last value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the last list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 1 if any element in `Arr[:n]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 1 if there exists an index `i` in `range(n)` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`, otherwise `flag2` is 0. If both `flag1` and `flag2` are 1, the string 'yes' has been printed for each iteration where these conditions were met. Otherwise, the string 'no' has been printed for each iteration where these conditions were not met.**
