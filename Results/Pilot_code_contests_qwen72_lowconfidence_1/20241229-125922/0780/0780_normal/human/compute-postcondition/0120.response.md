Functionality: ** The function `func_11` processes a series of queries, each defined by a positive integer `n` and a positive integer `k`. For each query, it checks a list `Arr` of `n` positive integers (extended by three zeros at the end). The function prints 'yes' if there is at least one element in `Arr` that equals `k` and there exists an index `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all queries, the variable `t` is 0, and the last values of `n`, `k`, and `Arr` are retained. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include when `n` is 1, in which case the function only checks if the single element in `Arr` equals `k`. **
