Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `i` is 2. If `Arr[i]` is equal to `k`, `flag1` is 1. If `Arr[i + 1]` or `Arr[i + 2]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `flag2` is 1. Otherwise, `flag2` is 0.***
