The value of `flag2` is set to 1. This change affects the condition that was previously determining the value of `flag2`. Now, regardless of the conditions involving `Arr[1]`, `Arr[2]`, `Arr[3]`, and `k`, `flag2` is explicitly set to 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `i` is 2. If `Arr[i]` is equal to `k`, `flag1` is 1. `flag2` is 1.
Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `i` is 2, if `Arr[i]` is equal to `k`, `flag1` is 1, `flag2` is 1**
