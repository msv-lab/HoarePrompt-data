Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`, `i` is 0, the current value of `Arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `Arr[0]` is equal to `k`, then `flag1` is 1, otherwise `flag1` remains 0. If either `Arr[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `k` or `Arr[i + 2]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `flag2` is 1. Otherwise, `flag2` remains 0.***
