The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect and does not change the state of any variables.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0. If `Arr[0] == k`, no changes are made to the variables. If `Arr[0] != k`, no changes are made to the variables.**
