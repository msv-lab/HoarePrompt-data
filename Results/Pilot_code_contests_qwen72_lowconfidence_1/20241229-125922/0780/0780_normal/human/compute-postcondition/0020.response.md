The value of `flag2` is set to 1. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`, `i` is 0, the current value of `Arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, if `Arr[0]` is equal to `k` then `flag1` is 1, otherwise `flag1` remains 0, `flag2` is 1, either `Arr[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `k` or `Arr[i + 2]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
