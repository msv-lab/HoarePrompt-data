The code snippet updates the value of `Arr` by appending the list `[0, 0, 0]` to the list returned by `func_5()`. The length of `Arr` remains `n + 3`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`.**
