The code snippet sets `flag2` to 1. This overrides the previous condition that `flag2` would be 1 only if either `Arr[2]` or `Arr[3]` is greater than or equal to `k`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`, `i` is 1, `flag1` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `Arr[1]` is equal to `k`, `flag2` is 1**.
