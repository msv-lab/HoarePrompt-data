The provided code snippet sets `flag1` and `flag2` to 0. This impacts the initial state by resetting these two flags to 0, regardless of their previous values.

Initial State Recap:
- `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment).
- `n` is the first value returned by `func_4()`.
- `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`.
- `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`.
- `flag1` is 1 if any element in `Arr[:n]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` is 0.
- `flag2` is 1 if there exists an index `i` in `range(n)` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`, otherwise `flag2` is 0.
- If both `flag1` and `flag2` are 1, the string 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, the string 'no' is printed.

After executing the code snippet:
- `flag1` is set to 0.
- `flag2` is set to 0.

The rest of the variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `Arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is the first value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0.**
