The provided code snippet is:
```
print('yes')
```

This line of code prints the string `'yes'` to the console and does not alter the state of any variables in the program.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state, except for the action of printing 'yes' to the console.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` is 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `4`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0, and the first element of `Arr` is equal to `k`. 'yes' is printed to the console.**
