To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`.
- `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `Arr[1]` is equal to `k`, `flag1` is 1. Otherwise, `flag1` is 0.
- If `Arr[1]` is greater than or equal to `k`, and either `Arr[2]` or `Arr[3]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `flag2` is 1. Otherwise, `flag2` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Increment of `i`**: In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
3. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is currently 1, it will be incremented to 2.
- **Check `n`**: The loop will execute again if `i` (which is now 2) is less than `n`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- The other variables (`t`, `k`, `Arr`, `flag1`, `flag2`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the increment of `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `i` is 2. If `Arr[1]` is equal to `k`, `flag1` is 1. Otherwise, `flag1` is 0. If `Arr[1]` is greater than or equal to `k`, and either `Arr[2]` or `Arr[3]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `flag2` is 1. Otherwise, `flag2` is 0.**
