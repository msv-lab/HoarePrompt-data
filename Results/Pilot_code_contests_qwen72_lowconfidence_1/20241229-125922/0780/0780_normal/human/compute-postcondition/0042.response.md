To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the current state:

### Given:
- `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1.
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`.
- `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, making the length of `Arr` equal to `n + 3`.
- The loop condition is `while t:`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is non-zero.
- Since `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1, it means `t` could be any non-zero integer (positive or negative).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute again if `t` is non-zero.
2. **Current State**: `t` is already non-zero.
3. **Adjustments Needed**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must remain non-zero. Since `t` is already non-zero, no adjustment to `t` is necessary.

### Conclusion:
The state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the state remains the same.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`.**
