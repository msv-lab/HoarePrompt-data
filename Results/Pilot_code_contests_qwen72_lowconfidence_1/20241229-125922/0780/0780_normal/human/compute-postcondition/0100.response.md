The code snippet sets the value of `flag1` to 1. This overrides the initial condition that `flag1` is 0 unless `Arr[1]` is equal to `k`. Since the code explicitly sets `flag1` to 1, this new value is now definitive.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 1, `i` is 1, `flag2` is 0 (unless `Arr[1]` is greater than or equal to `k` and either `Arr[2]` or `Arr[3]` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case it is 1)**
