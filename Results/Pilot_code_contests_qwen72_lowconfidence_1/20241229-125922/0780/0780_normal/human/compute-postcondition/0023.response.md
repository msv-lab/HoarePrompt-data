To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`.
- `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`.
- The length of `Arr` is `n + 3`.
- `i` is 0.
- If `Arr[i]` (which is `Arr[0]`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `flag1` is 1 if `Arr[0]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` remains 0.
- Additionally, if either `Arr[i + 1]` (which is `Arr[1]`) or `Arr[i + 2]` (which is `Arr[2]`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `flag2` is 1. Otherwise, `flag2` remains 0.
- If `Arr[i]` is less than `k`, `flag1` and `flag2` remain 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `Arr` is a list of length `n + 3`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. Since `n` is greater than 0, and `i` will be 1, the loop will execute again as long as `n` is greater than 1.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` needs to be updated from 0 to 1.
   - The values of `flag1` and `flag2` depend on the new value of `i` (which will be 1) and the corresponding elements in `Arr`.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`.
- `n` is greater than 1 (since the loop will execute again).
- `k` remains the value returned by `func_4()`.
- `Arr` remains the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`.
- The length of `Arr` is still `n + 3`.
- `i` is now 1.
- If `Arr[i]` (which is `Arr[1]`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `flag1` is 1 if `Arr[1]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` remains 0.
- Additionally, if either `Arr[i + 1]` (which is `Arr[2]`) or `Arr[i + 2]` (which is `Arr[3]`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `flag2` is 1. Otherwise, `flag2` remains 0.
- If `Arr[i]` is less than `k`, `flag1` and `flag2` remain 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`, `i` is 1, if `Arr[1]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `flag1` is 1 if `Arr[1]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` remains 0, and if either `Arr[2]` or `Arr[3]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `flag2` is 1, otherwise `flag2` remains 0. If `Arr[1]` is less than `k`, `flag1` and `flag2` remain 0.**
