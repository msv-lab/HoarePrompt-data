To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment).
   - `n` is the first value returned by `func_4()`.
   - `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`.
   - `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`.
   - `flag1` is 0.
   - `flag2` is 0.
   - If `n` is 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is not 1, the state of the variables also remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
   - However, if `n` is 1, the current iteration is skipped, which means the loop will not execute any iterations.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. This ensures that the loop will run at least once.
   - The other variables (`t`, `k`, `Arr`, `flag1`, `flag2`) do not need to be adjusted as they do not directly affect the loop condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 1. Here is the final state:

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0, `i` is 0**
