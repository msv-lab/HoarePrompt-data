The value of `flag2` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `i` is 1, `flag1` is 0 unless `Arr[1]` is equal to `k` (in which case it is 1), `flag2` is 1.**
