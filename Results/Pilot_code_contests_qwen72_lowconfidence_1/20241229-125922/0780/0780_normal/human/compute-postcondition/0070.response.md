The code snippet sets the variable `flag2` to 1. This changes the value of `flag2` from its initial state (which was 0) to 1. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1 (or minus 2 if `n == 1`), `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 1 if `Arr[0]` is equal to `k` and `Arr[1]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` remains 0, `i` is 2. If `Arr[i]` is equal to `k`, `flag1` is 1, `flag2` is 1.**
