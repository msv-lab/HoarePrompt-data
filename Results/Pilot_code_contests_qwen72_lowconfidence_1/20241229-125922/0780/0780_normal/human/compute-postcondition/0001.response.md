According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy (non-zero). Given that `t` is the integer returned by `func_6()`, and no information is provided about the function's return value, we need to ensure that `t` is non-zero for the loop to execute.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `Arr`) do not directly affect the condition of the `while` loop, but their values and constraints are important to understand the context in which `func_6()` operates. However, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is non-zero.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `Arr` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 10^9, and the length of `Arr` is n + 3 due to the addition of three zeros at the end.**
