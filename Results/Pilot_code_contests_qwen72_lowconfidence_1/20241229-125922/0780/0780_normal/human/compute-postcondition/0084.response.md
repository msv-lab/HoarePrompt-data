The code snippet `print('yes')` only prints the string 'yes' to the console and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `Arr`, `flag1`, and `flag2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is the first value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0.**
