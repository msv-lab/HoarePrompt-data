ou have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the while loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. 
In the information given, the output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 
The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the while loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times:  n must initially be greater than 0, `factorial` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Output State after loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1)`, `n` is decremented to `n-2`, initial `n` must have been greater than 1
Output State after loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`, `n` is decremented to `n-3`, initial `n` must have been  had greater than 2.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and fac will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 then the loop wont execute and fac will remain 1, which is indeed the factorial of 0 , and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `fac` is the factorial of the original value of `n`, 'n' is 0.
Output State: **n` is 0, `fac` is the factorial of the original value of 'n' **

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students', inital value of students must have been greater than 0
Output state after loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to twice the initial value of 'students' minus 1, 'students' becomes 2 less than the initial value of 'students', initial value of students must have been greater than 1
Output state after loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to three times the initial value of 'students' minus 3, 'students' becomes 3 less than the initial value of 'students', initial value of students must have been greater than 2

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in the end students will be 0. if students is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **'students' is 0, if students was initially greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to the initial value of students, if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**
Your Task:

Initial State: `t` is the integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `Arr` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 10^9, and the length of `Arr` is n + 3 due to the addition of three zeros at the end.
Code of the loop:
```
while t:
    n, k = func_4()
    Arr = func_5() + [0, 0, 0]
    flag1 = flag2 = 0
    if n == 1:
        if Arr[0] == k:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        t -= 1
        continue
    for i in range(n):
        if Arr[i] == k:
            flag1 = 1
        if Arr[i] >= k:
            if Arr[i + 1] >= k or Arr[i + 2] >= k:
                flag2 = 1
    if flag1 and flag2:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')
    t -= 1

```

The output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`. After the loop finishes executing: If `flag1` is 1 because at least one element in `Arr[0:n]` is equal to `k`, and `flag2` is 1 because there is at least one element in `Arr[0:n]` that is greater than or equal to `k` and there exists an index `i` such that `Arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `k` and either `Arr[i + 1]` or `Arr[i + 2]` (if they exist) is also greater than or equal to `k`, then the conditions specified in the if part are met. Otherwise, `flag1` is 1 if any element in `Arr[0:n]` is equal to `k`; otherwise, `flag1` is 0. `flag2` is 1 if any element in `Arr[0:n]` is greater than or equal to `k` and there exists an index `i` such that `Arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `k` and either `Arr[i + 1]` or `Arr[i + 2]` (if they exist) is also greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `flag2` is 0. Additionally, either `flag1` is 0 or `flag2` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1 (or minus 2 if `n == 1`). After decrementing `t` by 1, `t` will now be a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n == 1`).

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `Arr`, `flag1`, `flag2`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n == 1`), `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`. `flag1` is 1 if any element in `Arr[:n]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` is 0. `flag2` is 1 if there exists an index `i` in `range(n)` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`, otherwise `flag2` is 0. If both `flag1` and `flag2` are 1, the string 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, the string 'no' is printed.**
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 3 (or minus 4 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is the first value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 1 if any element in `Arr` (excluding the last three elements) is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 1 if there exists an index `i` such that `Arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `k` and either `Arr[i + 1]` or `Arr[i + 2]` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `flag2` is 0. If both `flag1` and `flag2` are 1, the string 'yes' has been printed. Otherwise, either `flag1` is 0 or `flag2` is 0.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state, after all the iterations of the loop have executed. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
If the state of some variables is dependant on earlier or the oginal value of some variable, make sure to seprate the original value from the current value.
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
