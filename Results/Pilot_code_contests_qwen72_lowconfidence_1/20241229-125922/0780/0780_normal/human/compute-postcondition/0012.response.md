The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the current iteration of a loop to end early, skipping any code that follows in the current iteration and proceeding to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1
- `n` is 1
- `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`
- `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `4`
- `flag1` is 0
- `flag2` is 0
- If `Arr[0]` is equal to `k`, 'yes' is printed to the console. Otherwise, `Arr[0]` is not equal to `k`.

The `continue` statement is encountered, which means the current iteration of the loop (if inside a loop) is terminated, and the next iteration begins. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1, `n` is 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `4`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0, if `Arr[0]` is equal to `k`, 'yes' is printed to the console. Otherwise, `Arr[0]` is not equal to `k`.**
