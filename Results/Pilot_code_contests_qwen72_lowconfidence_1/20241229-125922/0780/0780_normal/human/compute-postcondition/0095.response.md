Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `Arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `Arr[0]` is equal to `k`, then `flag1` is set to 1. Additionally, either `Arr[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `k` or `Arr[i + 2]` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
