The value of `t` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`. After the loop finishes executing: If `flag1` is 1 because at least one element in `Arr[0:n]` is equal to `k`, and `flag2` is 1 because there is at least one element in `Arr[0:n]` that is greater than or equal to `k` and there exists an index `i` such that `Arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `k` and either `Arr[i + 1]` or `Arr[i + 2]` (if they exist) is also greater than or equal to `k`, then the conditions specified in the if part are met. Otherwise, `flag1` is 1 if any element in `Arr[0:n]` is equal to `k`; otherwise, `flag1` is 0. `flag2` is 1 if any element in `Arr[0:n]` is greater than or equal to `k` and there exists an index `i` such that `Arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `k` and either `Arr[i + 1]` or `Arr[i + 2]` (if they exist) is also greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `flag2` is 0. Additionally, either `flag1` is 0 or `flag2` is 0.**
