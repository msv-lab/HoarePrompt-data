Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1 (or minus 2 if `n == 1`), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 1 if `Arr[0]` is equal to `k` and `Arr[1]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` remains 0. `i` is 1, `flag2` is 1 if `Arr[1]` is greater than or equal to `k` and if `Arr[2]` or `Arr[3]` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `flag2` remains 0.***
