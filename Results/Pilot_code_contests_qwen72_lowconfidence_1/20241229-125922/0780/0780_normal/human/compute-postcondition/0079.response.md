The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1 (or minus 2 if `n == 1`). After decrementing `t` by 1, `t` will now be a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n == 1`).

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `Arr`, `flag1`, `flag2`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n == 1`), `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`. `flag1` is 1 if any element in `Arr[:n]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` is 0. `flag2` is 1 if there exists an index `i` in `range(n)` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`, otherwise `flag2` is 0. If both `flag1` and `flag2` are 1, the string 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, the string 'no' is printed.**
