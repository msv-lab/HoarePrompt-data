The value of `flag2` is explicitly set to 1 by the code snippet. This overrides any previous condition that might have determined the value of `flag2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`, `i` is 2, if `Arr[2]` (or `Arr[i]`) is equal to `k`, `flag1` is 1; otherwise, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 1.**
