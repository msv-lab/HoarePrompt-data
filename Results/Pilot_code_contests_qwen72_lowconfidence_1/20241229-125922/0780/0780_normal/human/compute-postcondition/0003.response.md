The code `Arr = func_5() + [0, 0, 0]` updates the value of `Arr`. Initially, `Arr` was a list of `n` positive integers with three zeros appended at the end. After executing this line, `Arr` is now the result of `func_5()` with three zeros appended at the end.

Since `func_5()` returns a new list, the exact content of `Arr` is now determined by the return value of `func_5()`, followed by the three zeros. The length of `Arr` remains `n + 3`.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly modified by this code, but since `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`, their values are now the return values of `func_4()`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, and the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`.**
