The code snippet reassigns the values of `n` and `k` by calling `func_4()`. Since `n` and `k` were already assigned values from `func_4()` in the initial state, this call effectively does not change their values. However, the assignment operation itself is performed again.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the explicit reassignment of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`.**
