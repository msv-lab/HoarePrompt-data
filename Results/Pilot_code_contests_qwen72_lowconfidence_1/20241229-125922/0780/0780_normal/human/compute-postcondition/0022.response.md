Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`, and `i` is 0. If `Arr[i]` (which is `Arr[0]`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `flag1` is 1 if `Arr[0]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` remains 0. Additionally, if either `Arr[i + 1]` (which is `Arr[1]`) or `Arr[i + 2]` (which is `Arr[2]`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `flag2` is 1. Otherwise, `flag2` remains 0. If `Arr[i]` is less than `k`, `flag1` and `flag2` remain 0.***
