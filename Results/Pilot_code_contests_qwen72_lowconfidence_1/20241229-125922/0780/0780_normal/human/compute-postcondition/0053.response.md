Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1 (or minus 2 if `n == 1`), `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `Arr` (`Arr[0]`) is equal to `k`.***
