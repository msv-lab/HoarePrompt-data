The given code snippet updates the `Arr` variable by appending `[0, 0, 0]` to the list returned by `func_5()`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `flag1`, or `flag2`. However, it does change the length of `Arr` to `n + 3`.

Let's summarize the output state:

- `t` remains a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment).
- `n` remains the first value returned by `func_4()`.
- `k` remains the second value returned by `func_4()`.
- `Arr` is now the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with a length of `n + 3`.
- `flag1` remains 1 if any element in `Arr[:n]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` is 0.
- `flag2` remains 1 if there exists an index `i` in `range(n)` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`, otherwise `flag2` is 0.
- If both `flag1` and `flag2` are 1, the string 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, the string 'no' is printed.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is the first value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 1 if any element in `Arr[:n]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 1 if there exists an index `i` in `range(n)` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`, otherwise `flag2` is 0. If both `flag1` and `flag2` are 1, the string 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, the string 'no' is printed.**
