The code `continue` causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are directly modified by this statement, the state of the variables remains unchanged. However, the control flow of the program changes, as the next iteration of the loop (or the next statement after the loop if the loop ends) will be executed.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is `func_6() - 3` (or `func_6() - 4` if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is the first value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0. If `Arr[0] == k`, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state also remains unchanged. The current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
