The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. The initial state specifies that `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment). After decrementing `t` by 1, the new value of `t` will be:

- If `n` is not 1 after the assignment, `t` will be `func_6() - 3`.
- If `n` is 1 after the assignment, `t` will be `func_6() - 4`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `Arr`, `flag1`, `flag2`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is `func_6() - 3` (or `func_6() - 4` if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is the first value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0. If `Arr[0] == k`, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state also remains unchanged.**
