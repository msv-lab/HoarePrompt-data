The function `func_11` does not explicitly show any parameters being passed in its definition. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it seems the function likely interacts with external variables or parameters (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `Arr`) that are not directly passed to the function but are described in the context.

Given the context:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of queries.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `Arr` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 10^9, and the length of Arr is n + 3 due to the addition of three zeros at the end.

Since the function's signature does not include these parameters, and the output is not specified, we can infer that the function might perform some operations related to the provided parameters and return a result based on those operations. However, without further details on the expected output, we cannot definitively state what the function returns.

Based on the available information, the functionality of the function `func_11` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function `func_11` operates with external variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `Arr`, where `t` is the number of queries, `n` and `k` are positive integers, and `Arr` is a list of `n` positive integers extended by three zeros. The specific return value or output is not provided in the function description.**
