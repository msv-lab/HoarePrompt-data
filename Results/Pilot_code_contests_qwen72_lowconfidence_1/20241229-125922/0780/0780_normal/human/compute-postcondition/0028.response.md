Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`, and `i` is 1. If `Arr[1]` is equal to `k`, `flag1` is 1; otherwise, `flag1` is 0. If `Arr[1]` (or `Arr[i]`) is greater than or equal to `k`, and either `Arr[2]` or `Arr[3]` (or `Arr[i + 1]` or `Arr[i + 2]`) is greater than or equal to `k`, `flag2` is 1; otherwise, `flag2` is 0.***
