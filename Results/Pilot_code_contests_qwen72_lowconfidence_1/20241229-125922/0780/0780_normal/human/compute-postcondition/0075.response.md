The code snippet `print('yes')` prints the string 'yes' to the console and does not alter any variables or state information. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1 (or minus 2 if `n == 1`), `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`. `flag1` is 1, indicating that at least one element in `Arr[:n]` is equal to `k`. `flag2` is 1, indicating that there exists an index `i` in `range(n)` such that `Arr[i] >= k` and either `Arr[i + 1] >= k` or `Arr[i + 2] >= k`. The string 'yes' has been printed to the console.**
