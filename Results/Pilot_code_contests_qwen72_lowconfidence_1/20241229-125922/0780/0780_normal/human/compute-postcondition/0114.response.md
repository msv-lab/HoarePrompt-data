Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 2 (or minus 3 if `n` is 1 after the assignment), `n` is the first value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 1 if any element in `Arr` (excluding the last three elements) is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 1 if there exists an index `i` such that `Arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `k` and either `Arr[i + 1]` or `Arr[i + 2]` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `flag2` is 0, and either `flag1` is 0 or `flag2` is 0.***
