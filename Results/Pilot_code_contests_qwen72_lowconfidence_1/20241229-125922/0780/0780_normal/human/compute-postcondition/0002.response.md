The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `k` by calling the function `func_4()`. This means that the previous values of `n` and `k` are replaced by whatever values `func_4()` returns. The other variables (`t` and `Arr`) remain unchanged.

Since the specific values returned by `func_4()` are not provided, we can only say that `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`. However, the constraints on `n` and `k` from the initial state (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) should still hold true for the values returned by `func_4()`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `Arr` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 10^9, and the length of `Arr` is n + 3 due to the addition of three zeros at the end. `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`.**
