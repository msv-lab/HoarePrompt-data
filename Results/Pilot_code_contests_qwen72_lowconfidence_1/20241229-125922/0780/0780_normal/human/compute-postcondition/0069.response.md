Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()` minus 1 (or minus 2 if `n == 1`), `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]` with length `n + 3`, `flag1` is 1 if `Arr[0]` is equal to `k` and `Arr[1]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `flag1` remains 0, `i` is 2. If `Arr[i]` is equal to `k`, `flag1` is 1, and if `Arr[i + 1]` or `Arr[i + 2]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `flag2` is 1. Otherwise, `flag2` remains 0.***
