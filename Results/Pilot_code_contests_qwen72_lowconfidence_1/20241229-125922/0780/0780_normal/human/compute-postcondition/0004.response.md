The provided code snippet initializes two variables, `flag1` and `flag2`, both to 0. This does not alter the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `Arr`, which retain their values from the initial state. The only changes are the new assignments to `flag1` and `flag2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0.**
