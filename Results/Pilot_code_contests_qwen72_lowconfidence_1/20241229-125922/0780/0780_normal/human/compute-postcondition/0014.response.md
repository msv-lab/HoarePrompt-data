To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State Before the Loop:
- `t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`.
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`.
- `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`.
- The length of `Arr` is `n + 3`.
- `flag1` is 0.
- `flag2` is 0.
- If `n` is 1, `t` is `func_6()` minus 1, the length of `Arr` is 4, and if `Arr[0]` is equal to `k`, 'yes' is printed to the console. Otherwise, `Arr[0]` is not equal to `k`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.
2. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `k`, `Arr`, `flag1`, `flag2`) do not directly affect the loop execution but are part of the initial state.

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should be 0 before the loop starts.
- The other variables (`t`, `k`, `Arr`, `flag1`, `flag2`) remain as they are, as they do not directly impact the loop execution condition.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `Arr` is the list returned by `func_5()` followed by `[0, 0, 0]`, the length of `Arr` is `n + 3`, `flag1` is 0, `flag2` is 0, `i` is 0**
