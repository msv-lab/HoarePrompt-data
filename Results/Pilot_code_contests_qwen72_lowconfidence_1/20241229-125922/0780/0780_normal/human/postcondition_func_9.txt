The function `func_10` takes two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is a positive integer and `b` is a non-negative integer. It computes and returns `a` raised to the power of `b`. After the function concludes, `b` is reduced to 0, and the returned value is `a^b`. This function correctly handles all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
