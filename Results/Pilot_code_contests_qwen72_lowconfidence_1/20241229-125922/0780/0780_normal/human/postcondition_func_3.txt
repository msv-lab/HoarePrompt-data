The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line by whitespace into individual components, converts each component into an integer, and returns an iterator of these integers. The function assumes that the input consists of space-separated integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion process. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input has been processed and an iterator of integers is returned, ready for further use in the calling context.
