t is a positive integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ t. Each query consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, followed by a list of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total sum of n across all queries does not exceed 100,000.
