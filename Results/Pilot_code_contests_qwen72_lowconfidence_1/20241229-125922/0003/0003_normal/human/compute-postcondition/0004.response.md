The code defines a new lambda function `rstr_2d` which, when called with an argument `n`, reads `n` lines from stdin, strips leading and trailing whitespace from each line, and returns a list of the resulting strings.

Output State: **The function does not take any input parameters, the number of nodes `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, each edge is represented by a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, forming a valid tree, `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits the line by whitespace, and returns a list of strings, `rint` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, converts it to an integer, and returns the integer, `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits the line by whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of integers, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin, strips leading and trailing whitespace from each line, and returns a list of the resulting strings.**
