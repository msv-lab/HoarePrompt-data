The code defines a new lambda function `rstrs` which reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), splits the line by whitespace, and converts each element into a string, returning a list of these strings.

- The existing lambda function `rstr` remains unchanged.
- No variables are explicitly modified or created except for the definition of `rstrs`.
- The conditions regarding the tree structure, the range of `n`, and the properties of the edges remain valid as they are not altered by this code snippet.

Output State: **The function does not take any input parameters, the number of nodes `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, each edge is represented by a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, forming a valid tree, `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits the line by whitespace, and returns a list of strings.**
