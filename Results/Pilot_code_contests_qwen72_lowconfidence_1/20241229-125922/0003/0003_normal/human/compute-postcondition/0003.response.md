The code defines a new lambda function `rints` that reads a line from standard input, splits the line by whitespace, and converts each split part to an integer, returning a list of these integers. This definition does not affect the existing state of the program except for adding this new function.

The initial state includes:
- The function does not take any input parameters.
- The number of nodes `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- Each edge is represented by a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, forming a valid tree.
- `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.
- `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits the line by whitespace, and returns a list of strings.
- `rint` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, converts it to an integer, and returns the integer.

After defining `rints`, the output state is:
Output State: **The function does not take any input parameters, the number of nodes `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, each edge is represented by a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, forming a valid tree, `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits the line by whitespace, and returns a list of strings, `rint` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, converts it to an integer, and returns the integer, `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits the line by whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of integers.**
