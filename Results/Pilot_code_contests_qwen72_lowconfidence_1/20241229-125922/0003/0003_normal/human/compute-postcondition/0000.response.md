The code defines a lambda function named `rstr` that reads a line from the standard input (`stdin`), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string. This function does not affect any pre-existing variables or conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains largely unchanged except for the introduction of the `rstr` function.

Output State: **The function does not take any input parameters. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should be able to handle a tree structure defined by a set of edges, where the number of nodes n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each edge is represented by a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, forming a valid tree. `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.**
