The function does not take any input parameters. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should be able to handle a tree structure defined by a set of edges, where the number of nodes n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each edge is represented by a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, forming a valid tree.
