You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Thanos wants to destroy the avengers base, but he needs to destroy the avengers along with their base.

Let we represent their base with an array, where each position can be occupied by many avengers, but one avenger can occupy only one position. Length of their base is a perfect power of 2. Thanos wants to destroy the base using minimum power. He starts with the whole base and in one step he can do either of following: 

  * if the current length is at least 2, divide the base into 2 equal halves and destroy them separately, or 
  * burn the current base. If it contains no avenger in it, it takes A amount of power, otherwise it takes his B ⋅ n_a ⋅ l amount of power, where n_a is the number of avengers and l is the length of the current base.

Output the minimum power needed by Thanos to destroy the avengers' base.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, k, A and B (1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ A,B ≤ 10^4), where 2^n is the length of the base, k is the number of avengers and A and B are the constants explained in the question.

The second line contains k integers a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, …, a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 2^n), where a_{i} represents the position of avenger in the base.

Output

Output one integer — the minimum power needed to destroy the avengers base.

Output


8

Note

Consider the first example.

One option for Thanos is to burn the whole base 1-4 with power 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 4 = 16.

Otherwise he can divide the base into two parts 1-2 and 3-4.

For base 1-2, he can either burn it with power 2 ⋅ 1 ⋅ 2 = 4 or divide it into 2 parts 1-1 and 2-2.

For base 1-1, he can burn it with power 2 ⋅ 1 ⋅ 1 = 2. For 2-2, he can destroy it with power 1, as there are no avengers. So, the total power for destroying 1-2 is 2 + 1 = 3, which is less than 4. 

Similarly, he needs 3 power to destroy 3-4. The total minimum power needed is 6.
