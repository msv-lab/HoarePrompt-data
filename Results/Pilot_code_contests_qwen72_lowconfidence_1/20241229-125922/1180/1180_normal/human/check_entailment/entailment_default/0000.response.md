Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided follows the problem description accurately for every potential case. The function reads an integer `n` and a space-separated list of `n` integers from the user. It then performs the necessary swaps to reverse the segments as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it swaps elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) with their corresponding elements from the end of the list (n-1, n-3, n-5, ...), up to the midpoint of the list. This effectively reverses the segments as required by Dima's operations. The function then prints the modified list as a space-separated string.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected. It handles both even and odd lengths of the list correctly, ensuring that the middle element remains unchanged if `n` is odd. The function also correctly handles the case where `n` is less than 2, as no swaps occur in this scenario.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the code produces the correct output for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
