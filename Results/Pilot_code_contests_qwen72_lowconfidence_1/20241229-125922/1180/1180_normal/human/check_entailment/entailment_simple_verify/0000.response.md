Final: **False**

Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program correctly restores the initial order of the cubes based on the operations described. However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the problem description, there are some issues with the program's logic.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Dima performs several steps, on step \(i\) he reverses the segment of cubes from \(i\)-th to \((n - i + 1)\)-th.
- This continues while \(i \leq n - i + 1\).

### Program Logic:
- The program reads the input and processes the array by swapping elements in pairs from the outer edges towards the center.
- The key part of the program is the loop:
  ```python
  for i in range(0, n // 2, 2):
      j = n - 1 - i
      values[i], values[j] = values[j], values[i]
  ```

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program swaps elements in pairs from the outer edges towards the center, but it only does this for every second index (`range(0, n // 2, 2)`). This means it skips every other pair of elements.
   - For example, if the array is `[4, 3, 7, 6, 9, 1, 2]`, the program will only swap the elements at indices `(0, 6)` and `(2, 4)`, leaving the elements at indices `(1, 5)` unswapped.

2. **Reversal Steps**:
   - According to the problem description, Dima reverses segments of the array, not just swaps elements in pairs.
   - The correct approach should involve reversing the segments of the array as described in the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
- To correctly restore the initial order, the program should reverse the segments of the array as Dima did, starting from the outermost elements and moving towards the center.

### Example:
For the input `[4, 3, 7, 6, 9, 1, 2]`:
- Step 1: Reverse segment from index 0 to 6: `[2, 1, 9, 6, 7, 3, 4]`
- Step 2: Reverse segment from index 1 to 5: `[2, 3, 7, 6, 9, 1, 4]`
- Step 3: Reverse segment from index 2 to 4: `[2, 3, 9, 6, 7, 1, 4]`
- Step 4: Reverse segment from index 3 to 3: No change

The correct output should be `[2, 3, 9, 6, 7, 1, 4]`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is not accurate because the program does not correctly implement the reversal steps described in the problem. The program only swaps elements in pairs, which is insufficient to restore the initial order of the cubes. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
