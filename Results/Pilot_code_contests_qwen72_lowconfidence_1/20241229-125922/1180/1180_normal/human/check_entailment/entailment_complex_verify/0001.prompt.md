You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Young Timofey has a birthday today! He got kit of n cubes as a birthday present from his parents. Every cube has a number ai, which is written on it. Timofey put all the cubes in a row and went to unpack other presents.

In this time, Timofey's elder brother, Dima reordered the cubes using the following rule. Suppose the cubes are numbered from 1 to n in their order. Dima performs several steps, on step i he reverses the segment of cubes from i-th to (n - i + 1)-th. He does this while i ≤ n - i + 1.

After performing the operations Dima went away, being very proud of himself. When Timofey returned to his cubes, he understood that their order was changed. Help Timofey as fast as you can and save the holiday — restore the initial order of the cubes using information of their current location.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105) — the number of cubes.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 109 ≤ ai ≤ 109), where ai is the number written on the i-th cube after Dima has changed their order.

Output

Print n integers, separated by spaces — the numbers written on the cubes in their initial order.

It can be shown that the answer is unique.

Examples

Input

7
4 3 7 6 9 1 2


Output

2 3 9 6 7 1 4

Input

8
6 1 4 2 5 6 9 2


Output

2 1 6 2 5 4 9 6

Note

Consider the first sample.

  1. At the begining row was [2, 3, 9, 6, 7, 1, 4]. 
  2. After first operation row was [4, 1, 7, 6, 9, 3, 2]. 
  3. After second operation row was [4, 3, 9, 6, 7, 1, 2]. 
  4. After third operation row was [4, 3, 7, 6, 9, 1, 2]. 
  5. At fourth operation we reverse just middle element, so nothing has changed. The final row is [4, 3, 7, 6, 9, 1, 2]. So the answer for this case is row [2, 3, 9, 6, 7, 1, 4]. 
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    values = raw_input().split()
    for i in range(0, n // 2, 2):
        j = n - 1 - i
        (values[i], values[j]) = (values[j], values[i])
    print(' '.join(values))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the reversal operations described in the problem statement. It iterates over the list of values in steps of 2, swapping elements from the start and end of the list moving towards the center. This approach effectively reverses the segments as required by Dima's operations. The program handles both even and odd lengths of the list correctly, and the output matches the expected initial order of the cubes for the provided examples. Since the logic aligns with the problem description and no counterexample can be found where the program fails, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a1, a2, ..., an are integers such that -10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, representing the numbers on the cubes after Dima's reordering.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    values = raw_input().split()
    for i in range(0, n // 2, 2):
        j = n - 1 - i
        
        values[i], values[j] = values[j], values[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `values` is a list of strings where elements at indices \(0\) and \(n-1\), \(2\) and \(n-3\), \(4\) and \(n-5\), and so on, have been swapped up to the midpoint of the list.
    print(' '.join(values))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a space-separated list of `n` integers from the user. It then swaps elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) with their corresponding elements from the end of the list (n-1, n-3, n-5, ...), up to the midpoint of the list. The function prints the modified list as a space-separated string. If `n` is odd, the middle element remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 2, no swaps occur. The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values or out-of-range integers) and assumes the input is always valid.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
