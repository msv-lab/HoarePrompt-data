Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required to restore the original order of the cubes after Dima's reordering. Let's break down the solution and see why it meets the problem description:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of cubes.
   - It then reads a space-separated list of integers representing the numbers on the cubes after Dima's reordering.

2. **Reversing the Segments:**
   - Dima's reordering involves reversing segments of the list from index `i` to index `n - i + 1` until `i` exceeds `n - i + 1`.
   - To reverse this process, the program swaps elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) with their corresponding elements from the end of the list (n-1, n-3, n-5, ...), up to the midpoint of the list. This effectively undoes the segment reversals performed by Dima.

3. **Swapping Elements:**
   - The loop `for i in range(0, n // 2, 2):` iterates over the even indices up to the midpoint of the list.
   - Inside the loop, the elements at indices `i` and `j` (where `j = n - 1 - i`) are swapped.
   - This ensures that the elements that were reversed by Dima are restored to their original positions.

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - After the loop, the modified list is printed as a space-separated string.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Reversing the Reversals:**
  - Dima's operations involve reversing segments of the list. The program reverses these operations by swapping elements at specific indices, effectively restoring the original order.
  - The key insight is that reversing the segments in the described manner can be undone by swapping elements at even indices with their corresponding elements from the end of the list.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - If `n` is odd, the middle element remains unchanged, which is consistent with the problem description.
  - If `n` is less than 2, no swaps occur, which is also consistent with the problem description.

- **Assumption of Valid Input:**
  - The program assumes that the input is valid and does not handle invalid cases (e.g., non-integer values or out-of-range integers). This is acceptable according to the problem description, which states that the input will always be valid.

Therefore, the program correctly restores the original order of the cubes as required by the problem description, and it handles all valid cases appropriately. Hence, the program is correct.
