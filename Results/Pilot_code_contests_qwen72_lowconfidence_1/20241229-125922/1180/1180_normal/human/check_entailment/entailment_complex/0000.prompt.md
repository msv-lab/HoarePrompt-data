You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Young Timofey has a birthday today! He got kit of n cubes as a birthday present from his parents. Every cube has a number ai, which is written on it. Timofey put all the cubes in a row and went to unpack other presents.

In this time, Timofey's elder brother, Dima reordered the cubes using the following rule. Suppose the cubes are numbered from 1 to n in their order. Dima performs several steps, on step i he reverses the segment of cubes from i-th to (n - i + 1)-th. He does this while i ≤ n - i + 1.

After performing the operations Dima went away, being very proud of himself. When Timofey returned to his cubes, he understood that their order was changed. Help Timofey as fast as you can and save the holiday — restore the initial order of the cubes using information of their current location.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105) — the number of cubes.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 109 ≤ ai ≤ 109), where ai is the number written on the i-th cube after Dima has changed their order.

Output

Print n integers, separated by spaces — the numbers written on the cubes in their initial order.

It can be shown that the answer is unique.

Examples

Input

7
4 3 7 6 9 1 2


Output

2 3 9 6 7 1 4

Input

8
6 1 4 2 5 6 9 2


Output

2 1 6 2 5 4 9 6

Note

Consider the first sample.

  1. At the begining row was [2, 3, 9, 6, 7, 1, 4]. 
  2. After first operation row was [4, 1, 7, 6, 9, 3, 2]. 
  3. After second operation row was [4, 3, 9, 6, 7, 1, 2]. 
  4. After third operation row was [4, 3, 7, 6, 9, 1, 2]. 
  5. At fourth operation we reverse just middle element, so nothing has changed. The final row is [4, 3, 7, 6, 9, 1, 2]. So the answer for this case is row [2, 3, 9, 6, 7, 1, 4]. 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a1, a2, ..., an are integers such that -10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, representing the numbers on the cubes after Dima's reordering.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    values = raw_input().split()
    for i in range(0, n // 2, 2):
        j = n - 1 - i
        
        values[i], values[j] = values[j], values[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `values` is a list of strings where elements at indices \(0\) and \(n-1\), \(2\) and \(n-3\), \(4\) and \(n-5\), and so on, have been swapped up to the midpoint of the list.
    print(' '.join(values))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a space-separated list of `n` integers from the user. It then swaps elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) with their corresponding elements from the end of the list (n-1, n-3, n-5, ...), up to the midpoint of the list. The function prints the modified list as a space-separated string. If `n` is odd, the middle element remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 2, no swaps occur. The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values or out-of-range integers) and assumes the input is always valid.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
