**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly restore the original order of the cubes as described in the problem statement. Let's break down why:

1. **Understanding Dima's Reversal Operations:**
   - Dima reverses segments of the array starting from the first element to the last, then from the second element to the second-to-last, and so on, until the segment size becomes 1 or less.
   - For example, if the initial array is `[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7]`, the operations would be:
     - Reverse `[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7]` to get `[a7, a6, a5, a4, a3, a2, a1]`.
     - Reverse `[a2, a3, a4, a5, a6]` to get `[a7, a1, a5, a4, a3, a2, a6]`.
     - Reverse `[a3, a4, a5]` to get `[a7, a1, a6, a4, a3, a2, a5]`.
     - Reverse `[a4]` (no change).

2. **Program Logic Analysis:**
   - The program attempts to reverse pairs of elements at even indices and their corresponding positions from the end of the list.
   - Specifically, it swaps elements at indices `i` and `j = n - 1 - i` for every even `i` up to `n // 2`.

3. **Why the Program is Incorrect:**
   - The program does not perform the full set of reversals required to undo Dima's operations.
   - It only swaps elements at even indices and their corresponding positions, which is not equivalent to reversing the entire segment as Dima did.
   - For example, consider the input `[4, 3, 7, 6, 9, 1, 2]`. The correct output should be `[2, 3, 9, 6, 7, 1, 4]`, but the program will produce a different result because it does not fully reverse the segments as required.

### Example Case:
- **Input:** `7\n4 3 7 6 9 1 2`
- **Expected Output:** `2 3 9 6 7 1 4`
- **Actual Output:** The program will not produce the expected output because it only swaps specific pairs and does not perform the full set of reversals.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not correctly restore the original order of the cubes. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
