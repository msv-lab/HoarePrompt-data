Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the reversal operations described in the problem statement. It iterates over the list of values in steps of 2, swapping elements from the start and end of the list moving towards the center. This approach effectively reverses the segments as required by Dima's operations. The program handles both even and odd lengths of the list correctly, and the output matches the expected initial order of the cubes for the provided examples. Since the logic aligns with the problem description and no counterexample can be found where the program fails, the program is considered correct.
