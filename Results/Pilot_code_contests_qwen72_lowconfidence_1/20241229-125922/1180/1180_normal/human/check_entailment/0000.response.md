Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly restores the initial order of the cubes based on the operations described. It reads the input, processes the array by swapping elements in pairs from the outer edges towards the center, and prints the restored array. The logic of swapping every two positions ensures that the reversals performed by Dima are undone, thus restoring the original order. This approach works for both even and odd lengths of the array, and it correctly handles all edge cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
