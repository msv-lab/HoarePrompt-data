To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\).
- `values` is a list of strings obtained from user input.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(0, n // 2, 2):
    j = n - 1 - i
    values[i], values[j] = values[j], values[i]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` starting from 0, incrementing by 2, and stops when `i` reaches `n // 2`.
2. **Swapping Elements**: For each iteration, the elements at indices `i` and `j` (where `j = n - 1 - i`) are swapped.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- **`n`**: Remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- **`a1, a2, ..., an`**: These integers remain unchanged.
- **`values`**: The elements in the list `values` will be swapped in pairs from the start and end of the list, moving towards the center. Specifically:
  - If `n` is even, the loop will run \(\frac{n}{4}\) times.
  - If `n` is odd, the loop will run \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{4} \right\rfloor\) times.
- **Swapping Pattern**: The elements at indices `0` and `n-1`, `2` and `n-3`, `4` and `n-5`, and so on, will be swapped.

### Final Output State:
- **`n`**: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- **`a1, a2, ..., an`**: Integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\).
- **`values`**: A list of strings where elements at indices \(0\) and \(n-1\), \(2\) and \(n-3\), \(4\) and \(n-5\), and so on, have been swapped up to the midpoint of the list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `values` is a list of strings where elements at indices \(0\) and \(n-1\), \(2\) and \(n-3\), \(4\) and \(n-5\), and so on, have been swapped up to the midpoint of the list.**
