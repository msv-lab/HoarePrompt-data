The value of `j` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 4, the new value of `j` becomes `n - 1 - 4`, which simplifies to `n - 5`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `values` is a list of strings where `values[0]` and `values[n-1]` have been swapped, and now `values[2]` and `values[n-3]` have been swapped, `i` is 4, `j` is `n - 5`, `n` must be greater than 8**
