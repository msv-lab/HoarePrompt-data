`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is now a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The values of `a1, a2, ..., an` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, representing the numbers on the cubes after Dima's reordering.**
