The code snippet `values = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `values`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer within a certain range, and `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers representing the numbers on the cubes after Dima's reordering. After executing the code, the variable `values` will contain a list of strings corresponding to the input values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `values` is a list of strings obtained from user input.**
