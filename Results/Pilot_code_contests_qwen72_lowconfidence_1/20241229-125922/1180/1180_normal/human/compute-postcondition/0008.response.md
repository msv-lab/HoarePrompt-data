To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\).
- `values` is a list of strings where `values[0]` and `values[n-1]` have been swapped, and now `values[2]` and `values[n-3]` have been swapped.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `n - 3`.
- `n` must be greater than 4.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n // 2, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` starting from 0 up to `n // 2 - 1` with a step of 2.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `n - 3`.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Next Iteration of `i`**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `i + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n // 2`.
   - Since `i` is now 4, we need to ensure that `4 < n // 2`.

3. **Implication for `n`**:
   - To satisfy `4 < n // 2`, we need `n // 2 > 4`, which implies `n > 8`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is `n - 3` (unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop increment).
- `n` must be greater than 8.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `values` is a list of strings where `values[0]` and `values[n-1]` have been swapped, and now `values[2]` and `values[n-3]` have been swapped, `i` is 4, `j` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 8**
