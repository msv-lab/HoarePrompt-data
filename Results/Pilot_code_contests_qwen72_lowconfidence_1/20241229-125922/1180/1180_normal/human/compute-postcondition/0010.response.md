The code swaps the elements at indices `i` and `j` in the list `values`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4 and `j` is `n - 5`. The swap operation changes the positions of `values[4]` and `values[n-5]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `values` is a list of strings where `values[0]` and `values[n-1]` have been swapped, `values[2]` and `values[n-3]` have been swapped, and now `values[4]` and `values[n-5]` have been swapped, `i` is 4, `j` is `n - 5`, `n` must be greater than 8**
