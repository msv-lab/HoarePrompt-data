The value of `j` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, the new value of `j` is `n - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `values` is a list of strings where `values[0]` and `values[n-1]` have been swapped, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 4**
