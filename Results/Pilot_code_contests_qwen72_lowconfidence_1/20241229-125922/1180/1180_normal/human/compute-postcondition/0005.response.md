To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\).
- `values` is a list of strings where `values[0]` and `values[n-1]` have been swapped.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `n - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n // 2, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` starting from 0, incrementing by 2, and continues as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Increment `i`**: The loop increments `i` by 2 at the start of each iteration.
2. **Check Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n // 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- After the first iteration, `i` will be 2.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n // 2`. Therefore, `n // 2` must be greater than 2, which means `n` must be greater than 4.

### Final State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\).
- `values` is a list of strings where `values[0]` and `values[n-1]` have been swapped.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` remains `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `values` is a list of strings where `values[0]` and `values[n-1]` have been swapped, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 4**.
