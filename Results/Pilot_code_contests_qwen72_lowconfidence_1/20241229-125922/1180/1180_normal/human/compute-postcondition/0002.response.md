To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given Conditions:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \).
- `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \( -10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).
- `values` is a list of strings obtained from user input.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n // 2, 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `i`**: The loop iterates over `i` starting from 0, up to but not including `n // 2`, with a step size of 2.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, the upper bound of the range (exclusive) must be greater than the starting value. Therefore, `n // 2` must be greater than 0.
3. **Minimum Value of `n`**: Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2, `n // 2` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. This means `n` must be at least 2 (since `n // 2 = 1` when `n = 2`).

### Adjusted States:
- `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
- `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.
- The other conditions (`a1, a2, ..., an` and `values`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, so they remain as given.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `values` is a list of strings obtained from user input, `i` is 0**
