The code snippet `print(' '.join(values))` joins the elements of the list `values` into a single string separated by spaces and prints this string. This operation does not alter the values of any variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the contents of the list `values` have been printed as a space-separated string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `values` is a list of strings where elements at indices \(0\) and \(n-1\), \(2\) and \(n-3\), \(4\) and \(n-5\), and so on, have been swapped up to the midpoint of the list. The contents of `values` have been printed as a space-separated string.**
