The code swaps the elements at positions `i` and `j` in the list `values`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is `n - 1`, the first and last elements of the list `values` are swapped. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `values` is a list of strings where the first element (previously `values[0]`) and the last element (previously `values[n-1]`) have been swapped, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `values` is a list of strings where `values[0]` and `values[n-1]` have been swapped, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`**
