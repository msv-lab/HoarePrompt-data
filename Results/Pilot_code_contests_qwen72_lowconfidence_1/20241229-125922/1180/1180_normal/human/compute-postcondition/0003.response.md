The value of `j` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 0, `j` becomes `n - 1`. The other variables (`n`, `a1, a2, ..., an`, `values`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `values` is a list of strings obtained from user input, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`**
