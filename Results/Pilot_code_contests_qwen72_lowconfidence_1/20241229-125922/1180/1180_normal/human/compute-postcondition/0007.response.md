The code swaps the elements at indices `i` and `j` in the list `values`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is `n - 3`, the elements at these positions are swapped. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. The other conditions and variable values from the initial state remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a1, a2, ..., an` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `values` is a list of strings where `values[0]` and `values[n-1]` have been swapped, and now `values[2]` and `values[n-3]` have been swapped, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 4**
