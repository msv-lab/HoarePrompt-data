You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In one of the games Arkady is fond of the game process happens on a rectangular field. In the game process Arkady can buy extensions for his field, each extension enlarges one of the field sizes in a particular number of times. Formally, there are n extensions, the i-th of them multiplies the width or the length (by Arkady's choice) by ai. Each extension can't be used more than once, the extensions can be used in any order.

Now Arkady's field has size h × w. He wants to enlarge it so that it is possible to place a rectangle of size a × b on it (along the width or along the length, with sides parallel to the field sides). Find the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal.

Input

The first line contains five integers a, b, h, w and n (1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100 000) — the sizes of the rectangle needed to be placed, the initial sizes of the field and the number of available extensions.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (2 ≤ ai ≤ 100 000), where ai equals the integer a side multiplies by when the i-th extension is applied.

Output

Print the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal. If it is not possible to place the rectangle on the field with all extensions, print -1. If the rectangle can be placed on the initial field, print 0.

Examples

Input

3 3 2 4 4
2 5 4 10


Output

1


Input

3 3 3 3 5
2 3 5 4 2


Output

0


Input

5 5 1 2 3
2 2 3


Output

-1


Input

3 4 1 1 3
2 3 2


Output

3

Note

In the first example it is enough to use any of the extensions available. For example, we can enlarge h in 5 times using the second extension. Then h becomes equal 10 and it is now possible to place the rectangle on the field.
Program:
```
def func():
    f = lambda : map(int, raw_input().split())
    (a, b, h, w, n) = f()
    c = sorted(list(f()), key=lambda x: -x)
    d = {(h, w), (w, h)}
    for (i, q) in enumerate([1] + c):
        for (u, v) in d.copy():
            (h, w) = (u, v * q)
            if a <= w and b <= h or (a <= h and b <= w):
                print(i)
                exit()
            d.add((h, w))
            d.add((w, h))
    print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial field dimensions `(h, w)` already satisfy the condition to place the rectangle `(a, b)` without any extensions. According to the problem description, if the rectangle can be placed on the initial field, the function should return `0`. However, the provided program does not check this condition before entering the loop and applying extensions, which means it will always attempt to apply at least one extension, leading to an incorrect output of `1` instead of `0` for such cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3 3 3 5
2 3 5 4 2
```
The initial field dimensions `(3, 3)` already allow the placement of the rectangle `(3, 3)`, so the correct output should be `0`. However, the program will incorrectly output `1`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` reads two lines of space-separated integers from the standard input. The first line consists of five integers `a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, and `n`, where `1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000`. The second line consists of `n` integers, each in the range `2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000`. These integers are sorted in descending order and stored in the list `c`. The function then iterates over the list `[1] + c`, attempting to find a combination of dimensions `(h, w)` such that either `a <= w and b <= h` or `a <= h and b <= w`. If such a combination is found, the function prints the index `i` (number of iterations completed) and exits. If no such combination is found after iterating through all elements in `[1] + c`, the function prints `-1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result and exits.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
