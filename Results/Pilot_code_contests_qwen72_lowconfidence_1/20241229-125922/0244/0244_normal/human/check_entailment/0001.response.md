Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the possibility that the initial field dimensions might already be sufficient to place the required rectangle without any extensions. Additionally, the program does not correctly manage the state of the field dimensions after applying extensions, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3 3 3 3 1
2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

In this case, the initial field dimensions (3x3) are already sufficient to place the required rectangle (3x3), so no extensions are needed. However, the program incorrectly outputs 1, indicating that an extension is required. This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the initial field dimensions are already sufficient.
