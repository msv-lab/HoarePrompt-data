Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input and Output:**
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, you should use `input()` instead. This discrepancy can cause the program to fail if run in a Python 3 environment.
   
2. **Early Termination and State Management:**
   - The program uses `exit()` to terminate the program when it finds a valid configuration. While this works, it is generally better practice to use `return` or simply break out of the loop and print the result. Using `exit()` can make the program harder to test and integrate into larger programs.
   
3. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Extensions:**
   - The program attempts to find a valid configuration by multiplying the width or height by the largest available extension first. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple extensions are needed to achieve the desired configuration.
   - The program adds new configurations to the set `d` without checking if they are already present, which can lead to unnecessary computations and incorrect results.
   - The program does not correctly track the number of extensions used. It prints the index `i` of the current iteration, which may not correspond to the actual number of extensions used.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the initial field size is already sufficient to place the rectangle. It should print `0` in such cases, but the logic does not explicitly check for this condition.

### Example of a Failing Case:
Consider the input:
```
3 4 1 1 3
2 3 2
```
The expected output is `3` because it takes three extensions to make the field large enough to place a 3x4 rectangle. However, the program might terminate early or incorrectly count the number of extensions, leading to an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum number of extensions needed to place the rectangle on the field. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
