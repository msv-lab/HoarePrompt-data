You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In one of the games Arkady is fond of the game process happens on a rectangular field. In the game process Arkady can buy extensions for his field, each extension enlarges one of the field sizes in a particular number of times. Formally, there are n extensions, the i-th of them multiplies the width or the length (by Arkady's choice) by ai. Each extension can't be used more than once, the extensions can be used in any order.

Now Arkady's field has size h × w. He wants to enlarge it so that it is possible to place a rectangle of size a × b on it (along the width or along the length, with sides parallel to the field sides). Find the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal.

Input

The first line contains five integers a, b, h, w and n (1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100 000) — the sizes of the rectangle needed to be placed, the initial sizes of the field and the number of available extensions.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (2 ≤ ai ≤ 100 000), where ai equals the integer a side multiplies by when the i-th extension is applied.

Output

Print the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal. If it is not possible to place the rectangle on the field with all extensions, print -1. If the rectangle can be placed on the initial field, print 0.

Examples

Input

3 3 2 4 4
2 5 4 10


Output

1


Input

3 3 3 3 5
2 3 5 4 2


Output

0


Input

5 5 1 2 3
2 2 3


Output

-1


Input

3 4 1 1 3
2 3 2


Output

3

Note

In the first example it is enough to use any of the extensions available. For example, we can enlarge h in 5 times using the second extension. Then h becomes equal 10 and it is now possible to place the rectangle on the field.
Program:
```
def func():
    f = lambda : map(int, raw_input().split())
    (a, b, h, w, n) = f()
    c = sorted(list(f()), key=lambda x: -x)
    d = {(h, w), (w, h)}
    for (i, q) in enumerate([1] + c):
        for (u, v) in d.copy():
            (h, w) = (u, v * q)
            if a <= w and b <= h or (a <= h and b <= w):
                print(i)
                exit()
            d.add((h, w))
            d.add((w, h))
    print(-1)


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads two lines of space-separated integers from the standard input. The first line consists of five integers `a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, and `n`, where `1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000`. The second line consists of `n` integers, each in the range `2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000`. These integers are sorted in descending order and stored in the list `c`. The function then iterates over the list `[1] + c`, attempting to find a combination of dimensions `(h, w)` such that either `a <= w and b <= h` or `a <= h and b <= w`. If such a combination is found, the function prints the index `i` (number of iterations completed) and exits. If no such combination is found after iterating through all elements in `[1] + c`, the function prints `-1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result and exits.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
