Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial field dimensions `(h, w)` already satisfy the condition to place the rectangle `(a, b)` without any extensions. According to the problem description, if the rectangle can be placed on the initial field, the function should return `0`. However, the provided program does not check this condition before entering the loop and applying extensions, which means it will always attempt to apply at least one extension, leading to an incorrect output of `1` instead of `0` for such cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3 3 3 5
2 3 5 4 2
```
The initial field dimensions `(3, 3)` already allow the placement of the rectangle `(3, 3)`, so the correct output should be `0`. However, the program will incorrectly output `1`.
