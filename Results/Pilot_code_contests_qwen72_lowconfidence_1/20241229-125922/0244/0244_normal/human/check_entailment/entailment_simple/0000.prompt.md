You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In one of the games Arkady is fond of the game process happens on a rectangular field. In the game process Arkady can buy extensions for his field, each extension enlarges one of the field sizes in a particular number of times. Formally, there are n extensions, the i-th of them multiplies the width or the length (by Arkady's choice) by ai. Each extension can't be used more than once, the extensions can be used in any order.

Now Arkady's field has size h × w. He wants to enlarge it so that it is possible to place a rectangle of size a × b on it (along the width or along the length, with sides parallel to the field sides). Find the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal.

Input

The first line contains five integers a, b, h, w and n (1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100 000) — the sizes of the rectangle needed to be placed, the initial sizes of the field and the number of available extensions.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (2 ≤ ai ≤ 100 000), where ai equals the integer a side multiplies by when the i-th extension is applied.

Output

Print the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal. If it is not possible to place the rectangle on the field with all extensions, print -1. If the rectangle can be placed on the initial field, print 0.

Examples

Input

3 3 2 4 4
2 5 4 10


Output

1


Input

3 3 3 3 5
2 3 5 4 2


Output

0


Input

5 5 1 2 3
2 2 3


Output

-1


Input

3 4 1 1 3
2 3 2


Output

3

Note

In the first example it is enough to use any of the extensions available. For example, we can enlarge h in 5 times using the second extension. Then h becomes equal 10 and it is now possible to place the rectangle on the field.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, h, w, and n are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000. The list of extensions [a1, a2, ..., an] contains n integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000.
def func():
    f = lambda : map(int, raw_input().split())
    a, b, h, w, n = f()
    c = sorted(list(f()), key=lambda x: -x)
    d = {(h, w), (w, h)}
    for (i, q) in enumerate([1] + c):
        for u, v in d.copy():
            h, w = u, v * q
            if a <= w and b <= h or a <= h and b <= w:
                print(i)
                exit()
            d.add((h, w))
            d.add((w, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`. `d` is a set containing all unique tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)` generated from the initial tuples and the transformations within the loop. `i` is the number of iterations completed (including the initial value 0), or the value at the point of termination if the loop exits early due to the condition `a <= w and b <= h or a <= h and b <= w`. `q` is the last element in the list `[1] + c` used during the iteration. If the loop terminates early, `i` is printed and the program exits. If the loop completes all iterations without terminating early, `i` is the length of the list `[1] + c`, and `d` contains all possible tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)` generated through the loop.
    print(-1)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
