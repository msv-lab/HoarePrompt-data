Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is a function from Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This will cause the program to fail if run in Python 3.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Extension Application**:
   - The program attempts to apply extensions to both dimensions (`h` and `w`) in each iteration, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The problem requires finding the minimum number of extensions needed to make either dimension large enough to fit the rectangle, not necessarily both dimensions simultaneously.
   - The program adds both `(h, w * q)` and `(w * q, h)` to the set `d` in each iteration, which is unnecessary and can lead to redundant calculations.

3. **Early Termination**:
   - The program prints the result and exits the program using `exit()` when it finds a valid configuration. This is not the standard way to handle the problem and can cause issues in a larger program context. Instead, it should return the result.

4. **Handling Impossible Cases**:
   - The program correctly prints `-1` if it is impossible to place the rectangle even after applying all extensions, but it does not handle the case where the rectangle can already fit on the initial field (which should return `0`).

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve the following steps:
1. **Check Initial Condition**: If the rectangle can already fit on the initial field, return `0`.
2. **Sort Extensions**: Sort the extensions in descending order to try the largest extensions first.
3. **Apply Extensions**: Try applying the extensions to either the height or the width, and check if the rectangle can fit after each extension.
4. **Track Minimum Extensions**: Keep track of the minimum number of extensions needed to fit the rectangle.
5. **Return Result**: If the rectangle can be placed, return the number of extensions used. If not, return `-1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_extensions(a, b, h, w, n, extensions):
    # Check if the rectangle can fit on the initial field
    if (a <= h and b <= w) or (a <= w and b <= h):
        return 0
    
    # Sort extensions in descending order
    extensions.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Try applying extensions to either dimension
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions, start=1):
        # Try extending the height
        new_h = h * ext
        if (a <= new_h and b <= w) or (a <= w and b <= new_h):
            return i
        
        # Try extending the width
        new_w = w * ext
        if (a <= new_h and b <= new_w) or (a <= new_w and b <= new_h):
            return i
    
    # If it's not possible to place the rectangle
    return -1

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    a, b, h, w, n = map(int, input().split())
    extensions = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_extensions(a, b, h, w, n, extensions))
```

This corrected version correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement and ensures that the minimum number of extensions is found.
