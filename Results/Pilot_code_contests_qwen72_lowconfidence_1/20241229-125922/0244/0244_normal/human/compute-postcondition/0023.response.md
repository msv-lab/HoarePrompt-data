The `exit()` function call terminates the program execution immediately. As a result, no further code is executed, and the program ends without modifying any of the existing variables. Therefore, all the initial state variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing the tuples `(u, v)` and `(v, u)`; `i` is 0; `q` is 1; `h` is `u`; `w` is `v`.**
