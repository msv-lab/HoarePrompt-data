The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. No further execution occurs after this point, and no changes are made to the variables.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing the tuples `(u, v)` and `(v, u)`, `i` is 0, `q` is 1, and either (a ≤ w and b ≤ h) or (a ≤ h and b ≤ w) is true. The program has terminated.**
