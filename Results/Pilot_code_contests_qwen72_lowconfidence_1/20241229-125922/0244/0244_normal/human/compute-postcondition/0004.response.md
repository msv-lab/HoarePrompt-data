To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000.
- The list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000.
- `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`.
- `d` is a set containing the tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (i, q) in enumerate([1] + c):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `[1] + c`**: This creates a new list that starts with the integer `1` followed by all elements of the list `c`.
2. **`enumerate([1] + c)`**: This will iterate over the indices and values of the list `[1] + c`.

For the loop to execute, the list `[1] + c` must have at least one element. Since the list starts with `1`, it will always have at least one element. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Index `i`**: The index `i` should start at 0.
- **Value `q`**: The value `q` should be the first element of the list `[1] + c`, which is `1`.

### Final State:
The state needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial conditions of the loop:
- `i` is 0.
- `q` is 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing the tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)`, `i` is 0, `q` is 1**.
