The code snippet adds the tuple `(h, w)` to the set `d`. Since `d` already contains the tuples `(u, v)` and `(v, u)`, and given that `h` is `u` and `w` is `v`, the tuple `(h, w)` is equivalent to `(u, v)`, which is already in `d`. Therefore, adding `(h, w)` to `d` does not change the content of `d`.

The values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `c`, `i`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing the tuples `(u, v)` and `(v, u)`; `i` is 0; `q` is 1; `h` is `u`; `w` is `v`. If `a <= w and b <= h or (a <= h and b <= w)`, the conditions and variable states remain as described above.**
