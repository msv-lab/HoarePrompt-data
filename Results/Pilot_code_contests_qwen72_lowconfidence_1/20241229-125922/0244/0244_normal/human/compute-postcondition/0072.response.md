Postcondition: ***`h` is the new `u` from the next key-value pair `(u, v)` in `d.copy()`, `w` is the new `v * q` from the next key-value pair `(u, v)` in `d.copy()`, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, the list `[1] + c` must have at least `i + 1` elements, the next key-value pair `(u, v)` from `d.copy()` is the next item in the iteration, if `a <= w and b <= h` or `(a <= h and b <= w)`, the tuple `(w, h)` from the previous iteration is added to the set `d`, the value of `i` has been printed, and the program has exited. If the condition `a <= w and b <= h` or `(a <= h and b <= w)` is not met, the program continues to the next iteration.***
