The function `f` is defined as a lambda function that maps the input from `raw_input().split()` to integers. This means that when `f` is called, it will take a line of space-separated values and convert each value to an integer.

Since the function `f` is only defined but not called in the given code snippet, no actual input is processed, and the state of the variables remains unchanged. The initial conditions for `a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, and `n`, as well as the list of extensions, remain valid.

Output State: **a, b, h, w, and n are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000. The list of extensions [a1, a2, ..., an] contains n integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000. A function `f` is defined to map input to integers.**
