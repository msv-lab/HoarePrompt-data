The `exit()` function call causes the program to terminate immediately. No further changes occur to any variables or the program state after this point.

Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `i` is printed, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is the next element in the list `[1] + c`, the list `[1] + c` must have at least `i + 1` elements, `h` is `u`, `w` is `v * q`. Additionally, either (`a` is less than or equal to `w` and `b` is less than or equal to `h`) or (`a` is less than or equal to `h` and `b` is less than or equal to `w`). The program has terminated.**
