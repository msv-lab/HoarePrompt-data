To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000.
- The list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000.
- `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`.
- `d` is a set containing the tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)`.
- `i` is 0.
- `q` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (u, v) in d.copy():
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements of the set `d`.
- For the loop to execute, the set `d` must contain at least one tuple.
- The set `d` is initialized with the tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Set `d` must not be empty**: Since `d` is initialized with the tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)`, it will always contain at least these two tuples. Therefore, the set `d` is guaranteed to have at least one element, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.

2. **No need to adjust `i` or `q`**: The variables `i` and `q` are not directly related to the execution of the loop. They are not used in the loop condition or the loop body (as given).

3. **No need to adjust `a`, `b`, `n`, or the list of extensions**: These variables and the list of extensions are not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop body (as given).

4. **No need to adjust `c`**: The list `c` is not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop body (as given).

### Conclusion:
The only requirement for the loop to execute is that the set `d` must contain at least one tuple, which it does. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the given state.

### Final State:
State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing the tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)`, `i` is 0, `q` is 1**
