Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions [a1, a2, ..., an] contains n integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`. `d` is a set containing the tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)`.**
