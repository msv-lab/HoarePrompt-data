The code snippet `d.add((h, w))` impacts the dictionary `d` by adding a new key-value pair where the key is the tuple `(h, w)`. The values of `h` and `w` remain the same as they were before this operation. The conditions involving `a`, `b`, `h`, and `w` that determine whether `i` is printed and the program terminates are not affected by this line of code. The increment of `i` and the assignment of `q` from the list `[1] + c` also remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` now includes the key-value pair with the key `(h, w)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `q` is the next element in the list `[1] + c`, the list `[1] + c` must have at least `i + 1` elements, `h` is `u`, `w` is `v * q`. If `a` is less than or equal to `w` and `b` is less than or equal to `h`, or if `a` is less than or equal to `h` and `b` is less than or equal to `w`, then `i` is printed and the program terminates.
