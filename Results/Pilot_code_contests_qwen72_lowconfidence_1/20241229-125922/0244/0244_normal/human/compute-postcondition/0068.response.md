To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `h` is the new `u`
   - `w` is the new `v * q`
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration
   - The list `[1] + c` must have at least `i + 1` elements
   - The next key-value pair `(u, v)` from `d.copy()` remains unchanged
   - If `a <= w and b <= h` or `(a <= h and b <= w)`, the program has terminated
   - The tuple `(w, h)` is added to the set `d`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the key-value pairs `(u, v)` in `d.copy()`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more key-value pair `(u, v)` in `d.copy()`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `d.copy()`, the next key-value pair `(u, v)` will be the next item in the iteration.
   - The variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and the list `[1] + c` need to be updated based on the next key-value pair `(u, v)`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `h` should be updated to the next `u` in the iteration.
   - `w` should be updated to the next `v * q` in the iteration.
   - `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - The list `[1] + c` must still have at least `i + 1` elements to ensure the loop can continue.
   - The next key-value pair `(u, v)` from `d.copy()` will be the next item in the iteration.
   - The condition `if a <= w and b <= h or (a <= h and b <= w)` must still be checked to determine if the program has terminated.

5. **Final State:**
   - `h` is the new `u` from the next key-value pair `(u, v)` in `d.copy()`
   - `w` is the new `v * q` from the next key-value pair `(u, v)` in `d.copy()`
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration
   - The list `[1] + c` must have at least `i + 1` elements
   - The next key-value pair `(u, v)` from `d.copy()` is the next item in the iteration
   - If `a <= w and b <= h` or `(a <= h and b <= w)`, the program has terminated
   - The tuple `(w, h)` from the previous iteration is added to the set `d`

State: **`h` is the new `u` from the next key-value pair `(u, v)` in `d.copy()`, `w` is the new `v * q` from the next key-value pair `(u, v)` in `d.copy()`, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, the list `[1] + c` must have at least `i + 1` elements, the next key-value pair `(u, v)` from `d.copy()` is the next item in the iteration, if `a <= w and b <= h` or `(a <= h and b <= w)`, the program has terminated, and `(w, h)` from the previous iteration is added to the set `d`.**
