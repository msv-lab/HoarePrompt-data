Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two lines of space-separated integers from the standard input. The first line consists of five integers `a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, and `n`, where `1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000`. The second line consists of `n` integers, each in the range `2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000`. These integers are sorted in descending order and stored in the list `c`. The function then iterates over the list `[1] + c`, attempting to find a combination of dimensions `(h, w)` such that either `a <= w and b <= h` or `a <= h and b <= w`. If such a combination is found, the function prints the index `i` (number of iterations completed) and exits. If no such combination is found after iterating through all elements in `[1] + c`, the function prints `-1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result and exits. **

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input values are out of the specified ranges, the function may behave unpredictably.
- The function does not handle invalid input formats (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect number of inputs).
- The function does not check if the initial dimensions `(h, w)` already satisfy the conditions before starting the loop.
- The function does not provide any error handling or feedback if the input is malformed.
