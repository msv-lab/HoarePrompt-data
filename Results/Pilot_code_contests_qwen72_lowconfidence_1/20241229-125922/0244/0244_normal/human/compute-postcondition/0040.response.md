The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. This means no further code is executed, and the current state of the program remains unchanged except for the fact that the program has exited.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing at least one unique tuple `(h, w)`, `(w, h)`, and `(u, v * c[0])`, and now also contains the tuple `(v * c[0], u)`; `i` is 1; `q` is `c[0]`; `h` is `u`; `w` is `v * c[0]`. The program has exited.**
