Output State: **`a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`. `d` is a set containing all unique tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)` generated from the initial tuples and the transformations within the loop. `i` is the number of iterations completed (including the initial value 0), or the value at the point of termination if the loop exits early due to the condition `a <= w and b <= h or a <= h and b <= w`. `q` is the last element in the list `[1] + c` used during the iteration. If the loop terminates early, `i` is printed and the program exits. If the loop completes all iterations without terminating early, `i` is the length of the list `[1] + c`, and `d` contains all possible tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)` generated through the loop.**
