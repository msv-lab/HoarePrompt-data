To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and requirements:

1. **`d` must contain at least one tuple**: The loop iterates over the set `d`, so for the loop to execute, `d` must contain at least one tuple.

2. **Initial values of other variables**: The initial values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `extensions`, `c`, `i`, and `q` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they are part of the program state and should be mentioned for completeness.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `d` contains at least one tuple. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing at least one unique tuple `(h, w)` and `(w, h)` generated from the initial tuples and the transformations within the loop; `i` is 1; `q` is `c[0]`**.
