The function `f` is called, which returns a tuple of five values. These values are assigned to the variables `a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, and `n`. Since the function `f` is designed to return integers, the new values of `a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, and `n` are integers within the range specified in the initial state (1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000). The list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions [a1, a2, ..., an] contains n integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000.**
