Postcondition: ***`h` is the new `u`, `w` is the new `v * q`, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, the list `[1] + c` must have at least `i + 1` elements, and the next key-value pair `(u, v)` from `d.copy()` remains unchanged. If `a <= w and b <= h` or `(a <= h and b <= w)`, the program has terminated.***
