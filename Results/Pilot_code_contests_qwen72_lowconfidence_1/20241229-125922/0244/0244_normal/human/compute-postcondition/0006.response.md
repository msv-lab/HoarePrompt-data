The code snippet `h, w = u, v * q` updates the values of `h` and `w`. 

- `h` is now assigned the value of `u`.
- `w` is now assigned the value of `v * q`.

Given that `q` is 1, the value of `w` becomes `v * 1`, which simplifies to `v`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `h` is `u`.
- `w` is `v`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h` is `u`, `w` is `v`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing the tuples `(u, v)` and `(v, u)`, `i` is 0, `q` is 1**
