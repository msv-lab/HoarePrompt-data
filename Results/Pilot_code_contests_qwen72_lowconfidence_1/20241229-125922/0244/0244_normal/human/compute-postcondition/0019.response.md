The code adds the tuple `(w, h)` to the set `d`. Given that `w` is `v` and `h` is `u`, this means the tuple `(v, u)` is added to `d`. Since `d` already contains the tuples `(u, v)` and `(v, u)`, adding `(v, u)` again does not change the set `d`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing the tuples `(u, v)` and `(v, u)`; `i` is 0; `q` is 1; `h` is `u`; `w` is `v`.**
