The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. No further changes occur to the variables, and no additional operations are performed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing at least one unique tuple `(h, w)`, `(w, h)`, and `(u, v * c[0])`, and now also contains the tuples `(v * c[0], u)`, `(u, v * c[0])`, and `(w, h)`; `i` is 1; `q` is `c[0]`; `h` is `u`; `w` is `v * c[0]`. The program has terminated.**
