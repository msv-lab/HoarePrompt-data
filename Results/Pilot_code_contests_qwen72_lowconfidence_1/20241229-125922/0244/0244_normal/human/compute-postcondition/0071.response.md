The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. No further code is executed after this point, and the current state of the program is not altered by this command. However, since the program has terminated, no further operations can be performed, and the state of the variables remains as they were just before the `exit()` call.

Output State: **`h` is the new `u` from the next key-value pair `(u, v)` in `d.copy()`, `w` is the new `v * q` from the next key-value pair `(u, v)` in `d.copy()`, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, the list `[1] + c` must have at least `i + 1` elements, the next key-value pair `(u, v)` from `d.copy()` is the next item in the iteration, if `a <= w and b <= h` or `(a <= h and b <= w)`, the program has terminated, the tuple `(w, h)` from the previous iteration is added to the set `d`, the value of `i` has been printed, and the program has exited.**
