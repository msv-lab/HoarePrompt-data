To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, n ≤ 100,000.
- The list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000.
- `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`.
- `d` is a set containing all unique tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)` generated from the initial tuples and the transformations within the loop.
- `i` is 0.
- `q` is 1.
- The loop terminates if the condition `a <= w and b <= h or a <= h and b <= w` is met.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (i, q) in enumerate([1] + c):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration Mechanism**: The loop uses `enumerate` on the list `[1] + c`. This means the first element of the enumeration is `(0, 1)`, and subsequent elements are `(1, c[0])`, `(2, c[1])`, and so on.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `q` is 1.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next pair from the enumeration should be considered.
   - The next pair is `(1, c[0])`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `q` will be set to the first element of `c`.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- `q` is `c[0]`.
- All other states (`a`, `b`, `n`, `c`, `d`) remain unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing all unique tuples `(h, w)` and `(w, h)` generated from the initial tuples and the transformations within the loop; `i` is 1; `q` is `c[0]`.**
