The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. No further changes occur to the variables after this point. Therefore, the values of all variables remain as they were before the `exit()` call.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing at least one unique tuple `(h, w)` and `(w, h)` generated from the initial tuples and the transformations within the loop; `i` is 1; `q` is `c[0]`; `h` is `u`; `w` is `v * c[0]`; either `a ≤ w` and `b ≤ h` or `a ≤ h` and `b ≤ w` holds true.**
