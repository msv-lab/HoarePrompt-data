The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. No further code is executed, and the state of the program does not change beyond this point. Therefore, the variables retain their values as they were before the `exit()` call.

Output State: **`h` is the new `u`, `w` is the new `v * q`, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, the list `[1] + c` must have at least `i + 1` elements, the next key-value pair `(u, v)` from `d.copy()` remains unchanged, and the program has terminated.**
