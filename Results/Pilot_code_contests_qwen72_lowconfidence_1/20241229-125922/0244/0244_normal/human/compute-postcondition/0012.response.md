The code snippet adds the tuple `(w, h)` to the set `d`. Since `d` initially contains the tuples `(u, v)`, `(v, u)`, and `(h, w)`, adding `(w, h)` to `d` will not introduce a duplicate because sets do not allow duplicates.

Therefore, the only change is the addition of `(w, h)` to the set `d`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing the tuples `(u, v)`, `(v, u)`, `(h, w)`, and `(w, h)`; `i` is 0, `q` is 1. If either (a ≤ w and b ≤ h) or (a ≤ h and b ≤ w) is true, the program has terminated.**
