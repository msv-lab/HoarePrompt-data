The code `d.add((h, w))` adds the tuple `(h, w)` to the set `d`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for termination of the program (`If either (a ≤ w and b ≤ h) or (a ≤ h and b ≤ w) is true`) is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `w`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing the tuples `(u, v)`, `(v, u)`, and `(h, w)`, `i` is 0, `q` is 1. If either (a ≤ w and b ≤ h) or (a ≤ h and b ≤ w) is true, the program has terminated.**
