Postcondition: ***`d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `i` is incremented by 1, `q` is the next element in the list `[1] + c`, the list `[1] + c` must have at least `i + 1` elements, `h` is `u`, `w` is `v * q`. If `a` is less than or equal to `w` and `b` is less than or equal to `h`, or if `a` is less than or equal to `h` and `b` is less than or equal to `w`, then `i` is printed and the program terminates.***
