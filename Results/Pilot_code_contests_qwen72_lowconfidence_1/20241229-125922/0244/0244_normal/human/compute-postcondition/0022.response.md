The code snippet `print(i)` simply prints the value of the variable `i`. Given that `i` is 0 in the initial state, this will print `0`. No variables are modified by this operation, so all other variables retain their original values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, n ≤ 100,000; the list of extensions `[a1, a2, ..., an]` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000; `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list returned by `f()`; `d` is a set containing the tuples `(u, v)` and `(v, u)`; `i` is 0; `q` is 1; `h` is `u`; `w` is `v`.**
