You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a set of points on a straight line. Each point has a color assigned to it. For point a, its neighbors are the points which don't have any other points between them and a. Each point has at most two neighbors - one from the left and one from the right.

You perform a sequence of operations on this set of points. In one operation, you delete all points which have a neighbor point of a different color than the point itself. Points are deleted simultaneously, i.e. first you decide which points have to be deleted and then delete them. After that you can perform the next operation etc. If an operation would not delete any points, you can't perform it.

How many operations will you need to perform until the next operation does not have any points to delete?

Input

Input contains a single string of lowercase English letters 'a'-'z'. The letters give the points' colors in the order in which they are arranged on the line: the first letter gives the color of the leftmost point, the second gives the color of the second point from the left etc.

The number of the points is between 1 and 106.

Output

Output one line containing an integer - the number of operations which can be performed on the given set of points until there are no more points to delete.

Examples

Input

aabb


Output

2


Input

aabcaa


Output

1

Note

In the first test case, the first operation will delete two middle points and leave points "ab", which will be deleted with the second operation. There will be no points left to apply the third operation to.

In the second test case, the first operation will delete the four points in the middle, leaving points "aa". None of them have neighbors of other colors, so the second operation can't be applied.
Program:
```
def func():
    s = raw_input()
    a = [[s[0], 1]]
    for i in s[1:]:
        if a[-1][0] == i:
            a[-1][1] += 1
        else:
            a.append([i, 1])
    turns = 0
    while len(a) > 1:
        turns += 1
        temp = []
        if a[0][1] > 1:
            temp.append([a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1])
        for i in a[1:-1]:
            if i[1] > 2:
                temp.append([i[0], i[1] - 2])
        if a[-1][1] > 1:
            temp.append([a[-1][0], a[-1][1] - 1])
        if len(temp) < 2:
            break
        a = [temp[0]]
        for i in temp[1:]:
            if i[0] != a[-1][0]:
                a.append(i)
            else:
                a[-1][1] += i[1]
    print(turns)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it processes the segments of consecutive characters. Specifically, the issue lies in the way it handles the reduction of segments during each turn. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reduction Logic**: The program attempts to reduce the segments by subtracting 1 from the first and last elements and 2 from the middle elements if their counts are greater than the respective thresholds. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the simultaneous deletion of points.

2. **Edge Case**: Consider the input `"abab"`. The expected output is `2` because:
   - First operation: Deletes the middle two points, leaving `"aa"`.
   - Second operation: Deletes the remaining points, leaving nothing.

   However, the program will incorrectly handle this case because it doesn't properly account for the simultaneous deletion of points. It will only reduce the counts without considering the actual deletion and re-evaluation of the segments.

3. **Simultaneous Deletion**: The program should ensure that all deletions are processed simultaneously before moving to the next step. The current implementation processes deletions sequentially, which can lead to incorrect results.

To correct this, the program should:
- Simultaneously mark all points to be deleted in each operation.
- Reconstruct the list of segments after each operation based on the remaining points.

This would ensure that the program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a string `s` from the user, where `s` consists of lowercase English letters representing colors of points on a line. It processes the string to group consecutive identical characters and their counts into a list `a`. The function then repeatedly reduces the counts of these characters in a specific manner until no more reductions can be made. Specifically, it removes one occurrence from the first and last groups if they have more than one occurrence, and two occurrences from the middle groups if they have more than two occurrences. This process continues until the list `a` has at most one element or becomes empty. The function prints the number of iterations (turns) it took to reach this state. The purpose of the function is to determine the minimum number of points to remove from the input string so that no two adjacent points have the same color. Edge cases include when the input string is already in a state where no two adjacent points have the same color (in which case the function will print 0), or when the string is very short (e.g., a single character).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
