Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to properly handle the scenario where the remaining segments after an operation result in a configuration that should still allow further deletions but the program incorrectly stops.

Consider the following input:
```
"abab"
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

Actual output from the program:
```
1
```

In this case, the first operation should delete all points, leaving an empty string. However, the program incorrectly stops after the first operation because it does not correctly handle the remaining segments after the deletion, leading to an incorrect result.
