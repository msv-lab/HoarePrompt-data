You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a set of points on a straight line. Each point has a color assigned to it. For point a, its neighbors are the points which don't have any other points between them and a. Each point has at most two neighbors - one from the left and one from the right.

You perform a sequence of operations on this set of points. In one operation, you delete all points which have a neighbor point of a different color than the point itself. Points are deleted simultaneously, i.e. first you decide which points have to be deleted and then delete them. After that you can perform the next operation etc. If an operation would not delete any points, you can't perform it.

How many operations will you need to perform until the next operation does not have any points to delete?

Input

Input contains a single string of lowercase English letters 'a'-'z'. The letters give the points' colors in the order in which they are arranged on the line: the first letter gives the color of the leftmost point, the second gives the color of the second point from the left etc.

The number of the points is between 1 and 106.

Output

Output one line containing an integer - the number of operations which can be performed on the given set of points until there are no more points to delete.

Examples

Input

aabb


Output

2


Input

aabcaa


Output

1

Note

In the first test case, the first operation will delete two middle points and leave points "ab", which will be deleted with the second operation. There will be no points left to apply the third operation to.

In the second test case, the first operation will delete the four points in the middle, leaving points "aa". None of them have neighbors of other colors, so the second operation can't be applied.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a single string consisting of lowercase English letters 'a'-'z', representing the colors of points on a line, with the length of the string being between 1 and 10^6.
def func():
    s = raw_input()
    a = [[s[0], 1]]
    for i in s[1:]:
        if a[-1][0] == i:
            a[-1][1] += 1
        else:
            a.append([i, 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the input string, `a` is a list of sublists where each sublist is `[char, count]`, representing the character `char` from `s` and the count of its consecutive occurrences in `s`.
    turns = 0
    while len(a) > 1:
        turns += 1
        
        temp = []
        
        if a[0][1] > 1:
            temp.append([a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1])
        
        for i in a[1:-1]:
            if i[1] > 2:
                temp.append([i[0], i[1] - 2])
        
        if a[-1][1] > 1:
            temp.append([a[-1][0], a[-1][1] - 1])
        
        if len(temp) < 2:
            break
        
        a = [temp[0]]
        
        for i in temp[1:]:
            if i[0] != a[-1][0]:
                a.append(i)
            else:
                a[-1][1] += i[1]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `s` is the input string, `a` is a list of sublists where each sublist is `[char, count]` and represents the unique characters and their counts after the loop has processed `a` multiple times. The final `a` will have at most one element or be an empty list if the loop breaks due to `len(temp) < 2`. `turns` is the number of times the loop executed.
    print(turns)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string `s` from the user, where `s` consists of lowercase English letters representing colors of points on a line. It processes the string to group consecutive identical characters and their counts into a list `a`. The function then repeatedly reduces the counts of these characters in a specific manner until no more reductions can be made. Specifically, it removes one occurrence from the first and last groups if they have more than one occurrence, and two occurrences from the middle groups if they have more than two occurrences. This process continues until the list `a` has at most one element or becomes empty. The function prints the number of iterations (turns) it took to reach this state. The purpose of the function is to determine the minimum number of points to remove from the input string so that no two adjacent points have the same color. Edge cases include when the input string is already in a state where no two adjacent points have the same color (in which case the function will print 0), or when the string is very short (e.g., a single character).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
