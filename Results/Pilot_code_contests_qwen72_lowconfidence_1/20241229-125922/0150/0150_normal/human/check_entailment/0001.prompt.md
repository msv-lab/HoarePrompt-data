You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a set of points on a straight line. Each point has a color assigned to it. For point a, its neighbors are the points which don't have any other points between them and a. Each point has at most two neighbors - one from the left and one from the right.

You perform a sequence of operations on this set of points. In one operation, you delete all points which have a neighbor point of a different color than the point itself. Points are deleted simultaneously, i.e. first you decide which points have to be deleted and then delete them. After that you can perform the next operation etc. If an operation would not delete any points, you can't perform it.

How many operations will you need to perform until the next operation does not have any points to delete?

Input

Input contains a single string of lowercase English letters 'a'-'z'. The letters give the points' colors in the order in which they are arranged on the line: the first letter gives the color of the leftmost point, the second gives the color of the second point from the left etc.

The number of the points is between 1 and 106.

Output

Output one line containing an integer - the number of operations which can be performed on the given set of points until there are no more points to delete.

Examples

Input

aabb


Output

2


Input

aabcaa


Output

1

Note

In the first test case, the first operation will delete two middle points and leave points "ab", which will be deleted with the second operation. There will be no points left to apply the third operation to.

In the second test case, the first operation will delete the four points in the middle, leaving points "aa". None of them have neighbors of other colors, so the second operation can't be applied.
Program:
```
def func():
    s = raw_input()
    a = [[s[0], 1]]
    for i in s[1:]:
        if a[-1][0] == i:
            a[-1][1] += 1
        else:
            a.append([i, 1])
    turns = 0
    while len(a) > 1:
        turns += 1
        temp = []
        if a[0][1] > 1:
            temp.append([a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1])
        for i in a[1:-1]:
            if i[1] > 2:
                temp.append([i[0], i[1] - 2])
        if a[-1][1] > 1:
            temp.append([a[-1][0], a[-1][1] - 1])
        if len(temp) < 2:
            break
        a = [temp[0]]
        for i in temp[1:]:
            if i[0] != a[-1][0]:
                a.append(i)
            else:
                a[-1][1] += i[1]
    print(turns)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
