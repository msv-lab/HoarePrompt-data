The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `a` is either `[]` or `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]]`, and `i` is not equal to the first element of `a` if `a` is not empty.

If `a` is initially `[]`, after appending `i`, `a` becomes `[i]`.

If `a` is initially `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]]`, after appending `i`, `a` becomes `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1], i]`.

Other variables (`s`, `turns`, `temp`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `a` is either `[i]` or `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1], i]`, `turns` is 1, `temp` must have at least 2 elements. The last element of `a` is now equal to `i`.**
