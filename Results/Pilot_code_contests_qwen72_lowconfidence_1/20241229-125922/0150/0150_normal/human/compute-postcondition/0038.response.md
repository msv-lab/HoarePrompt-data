Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `a` is a list of sublists where each sublist is `[char, count]` and contains at least three sublists, `turns` is 1. `temp` is a list with fewer than 2 elements. If `a[-1][1]` is not greater than 1, `temp` is either an empty list or `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1], [i[0], i[1] - 2] for each `i` in `a[1:-1]` where `i[1] > 2]` if `a[0][1]` > 1. If `a[-1][1]` is greater than 1, `temp` is either `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1], [a[-1][0], a[-1][1] - 1]]` if `a[0][1]` > 1 and there are no `i[1]` in `a[1:-1]` greater than 2, or `temp` is a list with fewer than 2 elements if these conditions are not met.***
