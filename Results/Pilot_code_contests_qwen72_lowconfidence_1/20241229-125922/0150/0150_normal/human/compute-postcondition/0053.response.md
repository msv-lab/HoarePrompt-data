The code `a.append(i)` adds the fourth element of `temp` (which is `i`) to the list `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `s`, `i`, `temp`, or `turns` directly. However, the structure of `a` changes as it now includes an additional element.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is the input string
- `i` is the fourth element of `temp`
- `temp` must have at least 4 elements
- `turns` is 1
- If `i[0]` is not equal to `a[-1][0]`, `a` includes the fourth element of `temp`. Otherwise, the second element of the last sublist in `a` is incremented by `i[1]`.

After executing the code:
- `a` now includes the fourth element of `temp` (which is `i`).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is the input string, `i` is the fourth element of `temp`, `temp` must have at least 4 elements, `turns` is 1, `a` includes the fourth element of `temp` (which is `i`).**
