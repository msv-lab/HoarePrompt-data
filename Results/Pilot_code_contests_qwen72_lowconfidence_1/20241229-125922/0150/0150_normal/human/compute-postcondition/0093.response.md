Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `a` is either `[temp[0], temp[1], temp[2], i]` or `[temp[0], temp[2], i]` if `i[0]` (the first element of the fourth element of `temp`) is not equal to `a[-1][0]` (the first element of the last element of `a`). If `i[0]` equals `a[-1][0]`, `a` is either `[temp[0], temp[1], i]` or `[temp[0], i]` with the second item of the third-to-last element increased by `temp[3][1]`. If `i[0]` is equal to `a[-1][0]`, `a` remains either `[temp[0], temp[1]]` or `[temp[0]]` with `a[-1][1]` increased by `i[1]` (and further increased by `temp[3][1]` if applicable). `turns` is 2, `temp` must have at least 4 elements, and `i` is the fourth element of `temp`.***
