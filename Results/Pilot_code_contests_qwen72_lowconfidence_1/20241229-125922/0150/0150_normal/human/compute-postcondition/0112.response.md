The code appends a new element to the `temp` list, which is constructed from the last element of `a`. Specifically, the new element is a list containing the first element of the last element of `a` and the second element of the last element of `a` minus 1.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is the input string (unchanged).
- `a` must have more than one element (unchanged).
- `turns` is 3 (unchanged).
- `temp` is a list where each element is of the form `[i[0], i[1] - 2]` for every `i` in `a[1:-1]` where `i[1] > 2`. If `a[0][1] > 1`, the first element of `temp` is `[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]`. The last element of `a` has a second value greater than 1.

After executing the code:
- `temp` now includes the additional element `[a[-1][0], a[-1][1] - 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is the input string, `a` must have more than one element, `turns` is 3, `temp` is a list where each element is of the form `[i[0], i[1] - 2]` for every `i` in `a[1:-1]` where `i[1] > 2`. If `a[0][1] > 1`, the first element of `temp` is `[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]`. The last element of `a` has a second value greater than 1. `temp` also includes the element `[a[-1][0], a[-1][1] - 1]`.**
