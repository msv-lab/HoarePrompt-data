The value of `a[-1][1]` is incremented by `i[1]`. The initial state specifies that `a` is `[temp[0]]`, and `i` is the second element of `temp`, with `i[0]` being equal to `a[-1][0]`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `a[-1][1]`.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `a` is `[temp[0]]` with `a[-1][1]` incremented by `i[1]`, `turns` is 2, `temp` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `temp`, and `i[0]` is equal to `a[-1][0]`**
