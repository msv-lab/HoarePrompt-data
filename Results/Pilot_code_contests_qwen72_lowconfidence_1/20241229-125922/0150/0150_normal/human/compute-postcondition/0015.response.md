Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string with at least four characters, `i` is the fourth character of `s`. If `a[-1][0]` is equal to the third character of `s`, then `a` is `[[s[0], 2], [s[2], 2]]`. Otherwise, if `a[-1][0]` is not equal to the third character of `s`, then `a` is `[[s[0], 1], [s[1], 1], [s[2], 2]]` if `i` is the same as `s[2]`, or `a` is `[[s[0], 1], [s[1], 1], [s[2], 1], [i, 1]]` if `i` is different from `s[2]`.***
