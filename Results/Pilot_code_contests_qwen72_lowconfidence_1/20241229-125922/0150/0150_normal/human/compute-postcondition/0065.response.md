Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `a` has at least three elements, `turns` is 2, `i` is `a[1]`. If `i[1] > 2`, `temp` is updated to `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1], [i[0], i[1] - 2]]` if `a[0][1] > 1` or `[[i[0], i[1] - 2]]` if `temp` was initially an empty list, and the current value of `i[1]` is greater than 2.***
