To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `s` is the input string (this does not affect the loop directly).
- `a` must have more than one element.
- `turns` is 3 (this does not affect the loop directly).
- If `a[0][1] > 1`, `temp` is `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]]`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in a[1:-1]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `a` must have more than one element**: This is already given as a condition. However, for the loop to execute, `a` must have at least three elements because the loop iterates over `a[1:-1]`. If `a` has fewer than three elements, `a[1:-1]` will be an empty list, and the loop will not execute.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `a[1:-1]` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the first element of `a[1:-1]`.

### Adjusted State:
- `a` must have at least three elements.
- `i` is the first element of `a[1:-1]`.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is the input string, `a` must have at least three elements, `turns` is 3, if `a[0][1] > 1`, `temp` is `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]]`, otherwise `temp` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `a[1:-1]`**
