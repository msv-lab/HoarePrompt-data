Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `a` is `[temp[0]]`, `turns` is 2, `temp` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `temp`. If `i[0]` is not equal to the first character of the last element in `a`, then `a` becomes `[temp[0], temp[1]]`. Otherwise, `a[-1][1]` is incremented by `i[1]`.***
