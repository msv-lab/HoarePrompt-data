The code snippet appends a list `[i, 1]` to the list `a`. Here, `i` is the third character of the string `s`. Let's consider the two conditions from the initial state:

1. If `a[-1][0]` is equal to the third character of `s`, then `a` is `[[s[0], 2]]`.
2. Otherwise, `a` is `[[s[0], 1], [s[1], 1]]`.

In both cases, the code appends `[i, 1]` to `a`.

- For the first condition, `a` was `[[s[0], 2]]`. After appending `[i, 1]`, `a` becomes `[[s[0], 2], [s[2], 1]]`.
- For the second condition, `a` was `[[s[0], 1], [s[1], 1]]`. After appending `[i, 1]`, `a` becomes `[[s[0], 1], [s[1], 1], [s[2], 1]]`.

The value of `i` (the third character of `s`) remains the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is the input string with at least three characters, `i` is the third character of `s`, if `a[-1][0]` is equal to the third character of `s`, `a` is `[[s[0], 2], [s[2], 1]]`. Otherwise, `a` is `[[s[0], 1], [s[1], 1], [s[2], 1]]` and `a[-1][0]` is not equal to the third character of `s`.**
