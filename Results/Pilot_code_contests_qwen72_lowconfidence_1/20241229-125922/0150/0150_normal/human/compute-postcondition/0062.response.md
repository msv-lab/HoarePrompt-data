To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

Initial State:
- `s` is the input string (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `a` has more than one element.
- `turns` is 2 (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `temp` is an empty list.
- If `a[0][1] > 1`, `temp` is updated to `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]]`.

For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in a[1:-1]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will iterate over the elements in the slice `a[1:-1]`. For the loop to execute, this slice must contain at least one element.
2. **Slicing `a[1:-1]`**:
   - `a[1:-1]` means the loop will iterate from the second element to the second-to-last element of the list `a`.
   - For `a[1:-1]` to contain at least one element, the list `a` must have at least three elements (i.e., `len(a) >= 3`).

### Adjusted State:
- `a` must have at least three elements.
- `i` will be the first element in the slice `a[1:-1]`, which is `a[1]`.
- `temp` is either an empty list or updated based on the condition `a[0][1] > 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`s` is the input string, `a` has at least three elements, `turns` is 2, `temp` is either an empty list or `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]]` if `a[0][1] > 1`, `i` is `a[1]`**.
