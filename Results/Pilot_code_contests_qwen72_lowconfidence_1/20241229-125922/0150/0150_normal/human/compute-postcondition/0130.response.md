The code snippet `a[-1][1] += i[1]` increments the second element of the last sublist in `a` by the second element of `i`.

- `a` is initially either `[temp[0], temp[2]]` if `temp[2][0]` is not equal to `a[-1][0]`, or `[temp[0]]` with `a[-1][1]` incremented by `temp[2][1]` if `temp[2][0]` is equal to `a[-1][0]`.
- `i` is the third element in `temp`, so `i` is `temp[2]`.
- `i[1]` is the second element of `i`.

Thus, the second element of the last sublist in `a` (which is `a[-1][1]`) is incremented by `i[1]` (which is `temp[2][1]`).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is the input string, `a` is either `[temp[0], temp[2]]` if `temp[2][0]` is not equal to `a[-1][0]`, or `[temp[0]]` with `a[-1][1]` incremented by `temp[2][1] + temp[2][1]` if `temp[2][0]` is equal to `a[-1][0]`, `turns` is 3, `temp` is a list with at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `temp`.**
