Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `a` is a list of sublists where each sublist is `[char, count]` and `a` must contain at least four sublists, `turns` is 1, `i` is the fourth element in `a` (third element in `a[1:-1]`). If `i[1]` > 2, `temp` now contains a new sublist `[i[0], i[1] - 2]`. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.***
