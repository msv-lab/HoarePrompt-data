Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `a` is a list of sublists where each sublist is `[char, count]` and `a` must contain at least three sublists, `turns` is 1. If `a[0][1]` > 1, `temp` initially is `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]]`. After the loop finishes executing, `temp` will contain sublists `[char, count]` for each `i` in `a[1:-1]` where `i[1] > 2`, with each `count` reduced by 2. If no `i[1]` in `a[1:-1]` is greater than 2, `temp` will remain as `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]]` if `a[0][1]` > 1, otherwise `temp` will be an empty list. Additionally, the last sublist in `a` has a count greater than 1 (`a[-1][1] > 1`).**
