Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `a` is either `[[i[0], i[1]]]` or `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1 + i[1]]]`, `turns` is 1, `temp` must have at least 2 elements. If `i[0]` is not equal to the first element of the last sublist in `a`, then `a` is updated to `[[i[0], i[1]]]`. Otherwise, the second element of the last sublist in `a` is incremented by `i[1]`.***
