To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `s` is the input string with at least three characters.
- `i` is the third character of `s`.
- If `a[-1][0]` is equal to the third character of `s`, then `a` is `[[s[0], 2], [s[2], 1]]`.
- Otherwise, `a` is `[[s[0], 1], [s[1], 1], [s[2], 1]]` and `a[-1][0]` is not equal to the third character of `s`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in s[1:]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates over `s[1:]`, which means it starts from the second character of `s` and goes to the end of the string.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is currently the third character of `s`.
   - `s` has at least three characters, so `s[1:]` has at least two characters.
   - The current value of `i` is `s[2]` (the third character of `s`).

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the next character in `s[1:]`.
   - Since `i` is currently `s[2]`, the next character in `s[1:]` will be `s[3]` (the fourth character of `s`).

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` should be updated to `s[3]`.
   - `s` must have at least four characters to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

5. **List `a`**:
   - The state of `a` does not change based on the loop iteration itself but depends on the logic inside the loop body. Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine changes to `a` without that information. However, we can assume that the state of `a` remains as described in the given conditions.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is the input string with at least four characters, `i` is the fourth character of `s`. If `a[-1][0]` is equal to the third character of `s`, then `a` is `[[s[0], 2], [s[2], 1]]`. Otherwise, `a` is `[[s[0], 1], [s[1], 1], [s[2], 1]]` and `a[-1][0]` is not equal to the third character of `s`.**
