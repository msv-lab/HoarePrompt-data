Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `a` is a list of sublists where each sublist is `[char, count]` and `a` must contain at least three sublists, `turns` is 1, if `a[0][1]` > 1 then `temp` is `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]]` otherwise `temp` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in `a[1:-1]`. The current value of `i[1]` is greater than 2***
