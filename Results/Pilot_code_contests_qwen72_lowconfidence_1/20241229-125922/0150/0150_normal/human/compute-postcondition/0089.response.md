Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `a` is either `[temp[0], temp[1], temp[2]]` or `[temp[0], temp[2]]` if `i[0]` (the first element of the third element of `temp`) is not equal to `a[-1][0]` (the first element of the last element of `a`). If `i[0]` equals `a[-1][0]`, `a` remains either `[temp[0], temp[1]]` or `[temp[0]]` with the last element's second item increased by `temp[2][1]`. `turns` is 2, `temp` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` is the third element of `temp`.***
