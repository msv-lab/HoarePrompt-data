Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `a` is either `[temp[0], temp[1]]` if `i[0]` is not equal to `a[-1][0]`, or `[temp[0]]` with `a[-1][1]` incremented by `i[1]` if `i[0]` is equal to `a[-1][0]`. `turns` is 3, `temp` is a list with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `temp`.***
