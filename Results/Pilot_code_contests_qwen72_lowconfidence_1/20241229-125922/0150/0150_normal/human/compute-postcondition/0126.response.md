The code snippet `a[-1][1] += i[1]` updates the second element of the last sublist in `a` by adding the second element of `i` to it.

- `a` is initially `[temp[0]]`, which means `a` is a list containing the first element of `temp`.
- `i` is the second element in `temp`.
- The operation `a[-1][1] += i[1]` modifies the second element of the last (and only) sublist in `a` by adding the second element of `i` to it.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `s` is the input string (unchanged).
- `a` is now `[temp[0]]` but with the second element of the last sublist incremented by the second element of `i`.
- `turns` is 3 (unchanged).
- `temp` is a list with at least two elements (unchanged).
- `i` is the second element in `temp` (unchanged).

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `a` is `[temp[0]]` with `a[-1][1]` incremented by `i[1]`, `turns` is 3, `temp` is a list with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `temp`.**
