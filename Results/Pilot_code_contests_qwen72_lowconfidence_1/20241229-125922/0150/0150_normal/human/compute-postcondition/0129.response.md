The code appends the value of `i` (which is the third element in `temp`) to the list `a`. The initial conditions specify that `a` is either `[temp[0], temp[2]]` if `temp[2][0]` is not equal to `a[-1][0]`, or `[temp[0]]` with `a[-1][1]` incremented by `temp[2][1]` if `temp[2][0]` is equal to `a[-1][0]`. After appending `i`, the new value of `a` will include this additional element.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is the input string, `a` is either `[temp[0], temp[2], i]` if `temp[2][0]` is not equal to `a[-1][0]`, or `[temp[0], i]` with `a[-2][1]` incremented by `temp[2][1]` if `temp[2][0]` is equal to `a[-1][0]`, `turns` is 3, `temp` is a list with at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `temp`.**
