Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `a` is a list of sublists where each sublist is `[char, count]` and `a` must contain more than one sublist, `turns` is 1. If `a[0][1]` > 1, `temp` is `[[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]]`, and the count of the first character in `a` (i.e., `a[0][1]`) is greater than 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty list.***
