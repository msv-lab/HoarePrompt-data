Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string with at least three characters, `i` is the third character of `s`. If `a[-1][0]` is equal to the third character of `s`, then `a` is `[[s[0], 2], [s[2], 1]]`. Otherwise, `a` is `[[s[0], 1], [s[1], 1], [s[2], 1]]` and `a[-1][0]` is not equal to the third character of `s`.***
