The code snippet `a.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is the input string.
- `a` is `[temp[0]]`.
- `turns` is 3.
- `temp` is a list with at least two elements, where each element is of the form `[i[0], i[1] - 2]` for every `i` in `a[1:-1]` where `i[1] > 2`.
- If `a[0][1] > 1`, the first element of `temp` is `[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]`.
- If the last element of `a` has a second value greater than 1, `temp` also includes the element `[a[-1][0], a[-1][1] - 1]`.
- The current value of `i[0]` is not equal to the first element of the last element of `a` (`a[-1][0]`).

After executing `a.append(i)`, the new state is:
- `s` remains the input string.
- `a` now includes the value of `i` at its end, making the new list `a` equal to `[temp[0], i]`.
- `turns` remains 3.
- `temp` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is the input string, `a` is `[temp[0], i]`, `turns` is 3, `temp` is a list with at least two elements, where each element is of the form `[i[0], i[1] - 2]` for every `i` in `a[1:-1]` where `i[1] > 2`, if `a[0][1] > 1`, the first element of `temp` is `[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]`, if the last element of `a` has a second value greater than 1, `temp` also includes the element `[a[-1][0], a[-1][1] - 1]`, the current value of `i[0]` is not equal to the first element of the last element of `a` (`a[-1][0]`).**
