Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `a` must have more than one element, `turns` is 3, `temp` is a list where each element is of the form `[i[0], i[1] - 2]` for every `i` in `a[1:-1]` where `i[1] > 2`. If `a[0][1] > 1`, the first element of `temp` is `[a[0][0], a[0][1] - 1]`. If the last element of `a` has a second value greater than 1, `temp` also includes the element `[a[-1][0], a[-1][1] - 1]`. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged. The length of `temp` is less than 2.***
