The provided code snippet updates the second element of the last sublist in `a` by adding `i[1]` to it. Here's the analysis:

- `a[-1][1]` refers to the second element of the last sublist in `a`.
- `i[1]` refers to the second element of `i`, which is the fourth element of `temp`.

Since the code does not include a conditional check for `i[0]` being equal to `a[-1][0]`, it assumes that this condition is true, and thus the operation `a[-1][1] += i[1]` is performed.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is the input string, `i` is the fourth element of `temp`, `temp` must have at least 4 elements, `turns` is 1, `a[-1][1]` is incremented by `i[1]`**.
