The code appends the second element of `temp` (which is `i`) to the list `a`. The list `a` was initially `[temp[0]]`, so after the operation, `a` will be `[temp[0], temp[1]]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is the input string, `a` is `[temp[0], temp[1]]`, `turns` is 3, `temp` is a list with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `temp`**.
