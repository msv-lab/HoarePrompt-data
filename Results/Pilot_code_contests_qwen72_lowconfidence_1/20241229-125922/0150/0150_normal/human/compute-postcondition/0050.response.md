The line of code `a[-1][1] += i[1]` modifies the second element of the last sublist in `a` by adding the second element of the third element of `temp` to it.

Given:
- `s` is the input string (unchanged)
- `a` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop (specifically, the second element of the last sublist in `a` is updated)
- `i` is the third element of `temp`
- `temp` must have at least 3 elements (unchanged)
- `turns` is 1 (unchanged)

The specific impact of the code is:
- The second element of the last sublist in `a` is incremented by `i[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is the input string, `a[-1][1]` is `a[-1][1] + i[1]`, `i` is the third element of `temp`, `temp` must have at least 3 elements, `turns` is 1**.
