You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: For years, the Day of city N was held in the most rainy day of summer. New mayor decided to break this tradition and select a not-so-rainy day for the celebration. The mayor knows the weather forecast for the n days of summer. On the i-th day, a_i millimeters of rain will fall. All values a_i are distinct.

The mayor knows that citizens will watch the weather x days before the celebration and y days after. Because of that, he says that a day d is not-so-rainy if a_d is smaller than rain amounts at each of x days before day d and and each of y days after day d. In other words, a_d < a_j should hold for all d - x ≤ j < d and d < j ≤ d + y. Citizens only watch the weather during summer, so we only consider such j that 1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Help mayor find the earliest not-so-rainy day of summer.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, x and y (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 7) — the number of days in summer, the number of days citizens watch the weather before the celebration and the number of days they do that after.

The second line contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i denotes the rain amount on the i-th day.

Output

Print a single integer — the index of the earliest not-so-rainy day of summer. We can show that the answer always exists.

Examples

Input


10 2 2
10 9 6 7 8 3 2 1 4 5


Output


3


Input


10 2 3
10 9 6 7 8 3 2 1 4 5


Output


8


Input


5 5 5
100000 10000 1000 100 10


Output


5

Note

In the first example days 3 and 8 are not-so-rainy. The 3-rd day is earlier.

In the second example day 3 is not not-so-rainy, because 3 + y = 6 and a_3 > a_6. Thus, day 8 is the answer. Note that 8 + y = 11, but we don't consider day 11, because it is not summer.
