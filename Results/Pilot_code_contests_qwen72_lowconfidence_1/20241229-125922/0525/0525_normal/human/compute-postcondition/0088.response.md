The code snippet `indis = i - bef` updates the value of `indis`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `bef` is 2

The calculation for `indis` is:
\[ \text{indis} = i - \text{bef} = 1 - 2 = -1 \]

Therefore, the updated value of `indis` is -1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 7, `y` is an integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 7, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the recursion limit is set to 1,000,000, `inp2` is a list (or iterator) of integers obtained from the input, `val` is the second element of `inp2`, `aft` is the last value of `aft` before the loop terminated, `indis` is -1, `bef` is 2, `flag` is `True` if `val` ≤ `inp2[indis]` and `False` otherwise.**
