Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 7, `y` must be at least 1 (0 ≤ y ≤ 7), `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the recursion limit is set to 1,000,000, `inp2` is a list (or iterator) of integers obtained from the input, `val` is the second element of `inp2`, `aft` is 1, `indis` is 2, `bef` is the last value of `bef` before the loop terminated, `flag` is `False` if `val` is greater than any `inp2[indis]` within the valid range of indices (0 to n-1), otherwise `flag` remains `True`. If `indis` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
