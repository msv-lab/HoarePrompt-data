Postcondition: **`n` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 7, `y` is an integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 7, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the recursion limit is set to 1,000,000, `inp2` is a list (or iterator) of integers obtained from the input, `val` is the first element of `inp2`, `aft` is the last value of `aft` before the loop terminated, `indis` is the last value of `indis` before the loop terminated. If the loop did not execute, `aft` is 0, `indis` is 0, and `flag` remains `True`. The current value of `flag` is `True`, indicating that `val` is not greater than any element in `inp2` from index `i + 1` to `i + y` (inclusive).**
