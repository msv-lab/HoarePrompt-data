The provided code snippet sets the recursion limit using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list `a`. The only change is in the system configuration regarding the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 7, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The recursion limit is set to 1,000,000.**
