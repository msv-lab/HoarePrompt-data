Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `x` is an integer from the input such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 7, `y` is an integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 7, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the recursion limit is set to 1,000,000, `inp2` is a list (or iterator) of integers obtained from the input, `i` is the last index of `inp2` checked, `val` is the last element of `inp2` that was processed, `aft` is the last value of `aft` before the loop terminated, `indis` is the last value of `indis` before the loop terminated. If the loop completes without breaking, `i` will be `n-1`. If the loop finds an `i` such that `val` (which is `inp2[i]`) is not greater than any element in `inp2` from `i - x` to `i + y` (inclusive), `flag` remains `True`, and `i + 1` is printed. If no such `i` is found, the loop completes without printing anything, and `flag` is `False`.**
