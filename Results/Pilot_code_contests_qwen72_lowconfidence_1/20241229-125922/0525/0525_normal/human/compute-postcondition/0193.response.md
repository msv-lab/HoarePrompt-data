Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 7, `y` is an integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 7, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the recursion limit is set to 1,000,000, `inp2` is a list (or iterator) of integers obtained from the input, `val` is the third element of `inp2`, `aft` is 2, `indis` is 4, `bef` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2. If `indis` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `flag` is False.**
