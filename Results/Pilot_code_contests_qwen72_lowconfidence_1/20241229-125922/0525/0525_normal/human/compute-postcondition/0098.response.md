The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in, but does not alter the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the fact that the loop or if statement is exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 7, `y` is an integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 7, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the recursion limit is set to 1,000,000, `inp2` is a list (or iterator) of integers obtained from the input, `val` is the second element of `inp2`, `aft` is the last value of `aft` before the loop terminated, `indis` is -2, `bef` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
