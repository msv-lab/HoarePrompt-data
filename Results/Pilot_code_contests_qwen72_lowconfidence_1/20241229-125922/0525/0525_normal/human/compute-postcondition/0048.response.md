Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 7, `y` is an integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 7, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the recursion limit is set to 1,000,000, `inp2` is a list (or iterator) of integers obtained from the input, `val` is the first element of `inp2`, `flag` is `True` if no element in `inp2` from index `i-1` to `i-x` (inclusive) is less than `val`, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `indis` is equal to `0 + aft`. If `indis` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `val` is greater than the element at index `indis` in `inp2`, then `flag` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
