The code snippet reads three integer values from the input and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated based on the input provided. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `x` is an integer from the input such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 7, `y` is an integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 7, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the recursion limit is set to 1,000,000.**
