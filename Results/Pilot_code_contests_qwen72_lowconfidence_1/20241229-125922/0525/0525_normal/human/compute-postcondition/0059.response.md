The code snippet `indis = i + aft` updates the value of `indis` by adding the value of `i` to `aft`.

- Initial values:
  - `i` is 0
  - `aft` is 3

- Calculation:
  - `indis` = `i` + `aft` = 0 + 3 = 3

Therefore, the updated value of `indis` is 3.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. The new state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 7, `y` is an integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 7, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the recursion limit is set to 1,000,000, `inp2` is a list (or iterator) of integers obtained from the input, `val` is the first element of `inp2`, `aft` is 3, `indis` is 3, if `val` > `inp2[2]`, `flag` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` retains its original value.**
