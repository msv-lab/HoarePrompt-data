To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the initial state:

### Given For Loop Statement:
```python
for aft in range(1, y + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000
- `i` is 1
- `x` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 7
- `y` is an integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 7
- `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- The recursion limit is set to 1,000,000
- `inp2` is a list (or iterator) of integers obtained from the input
- `val` is the second element of `inp2`
- `aft` is the last value of `aft` before the loop terminated
- `indis` is the last value of `indis` before the loop terminated
- `bef` is the last value of `bef` before the loop terminated
- `flag` is `False` if `val` is greater than any `inp2[indis]` within the valid range of indices (0 to n-1), otherwise `flag` remains `True`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, y + 1)` is not empty. This means `y` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
2. **Initial Value of `aft`**: The variable `aft` is used as the loop variable and will take values from 1 to `y` (inclusive). Therefore, `aft` should start at 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000
- `i` is 1
- `x` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 7
- `y` must be at least 1 (0 ≤ y ≤ 7)
- `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- The recursion limit is set to 1,000,000
- `inp2` is a list (or iterator) of integers obtained from the input
- `val` is the second element of `inp2`
- `aft` is 1 (initial value for the loop)
- `indis` is the last value of `indis` before the loop terminated
- `bef` is the last value of `bef` before the loop terminated
- `flag` is `False` if `val` is greater than any `inp2[indis]` within the valid range of indices (0 to n-1), otherwise `flag` remains `True`

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 7, `y` must be at least 1 (0 ≤ y ≤ 7), `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the recursion limit is set to 1,000,000, `inp2` is a list (or iterator) of integers obtained from the input, `val` is the second element of `inp2`, `aft` is 1, `indis` is the last value of `indis` before the loop terminated, `bef` is the last value of `bef` before the loop terminated, `flag` is `False` if `val` is greater than any `inp2[indis]` within the valid range of indices (0 to n-1), otherwise `flag` remains `True`**
