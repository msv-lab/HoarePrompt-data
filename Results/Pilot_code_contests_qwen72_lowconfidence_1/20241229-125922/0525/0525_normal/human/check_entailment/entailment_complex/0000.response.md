Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two lines of input. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` and `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 7`.
   - The second line contains `n` distinct integers, each between `1` and `10^9`.

2. **Logic for Finding the Not-So-Rainy Day**:
   - The program iterates over each day `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each day `i`, it checks if the rain amount `inp2[i]` is less than the rain amounts for the `x` days before and the `y` days after.
   - If the condition is met (i.e., `inp2[i]` is less than the rain amounts for the specified days), the program prints the 1-based index of the day (`i + 1`) and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the indices go out of bounds. For example, when checking the days before or after, it ensures that the indices do not go below `0` or above `n-1`.

4. **Recursion Limit**:
   - Although the recursion limit is set to `1,000,000`, the program does not use recursion, so this setting does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Why It Meets the Problem Description:

- **Correctness of Conditions**: The program correctly checks if the current day's rain amount is less than the rain amounts for the `x` days before and the `y` days after. This is done using nested loops, which iterate over the appropriate range of days.
- **Earliest Not-So-Rainy Day**: The program prints the 1-based index of the first day that meets the not-so-rainy condition and then breaks out of the loop. This ensures that the earliest day is selected.
- **Handling Distinct Rain Amounts**: The problem states that all rain amounts are distinct, and the program does not require any special handling for this condition, as the logic naturally works with distinct values.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to find the earliest not-so-rainy day of summer according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
