Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. Since the problem does not specify the Python version, it is reasonable to assume that the code should work in Python 3. Therefore, using `raw_input()` is incorrect.

2. **Recursion Limit**: Setting the recursion limit with `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)` is unnecessary for this problem. The problem involves a straightforward iteration over the list of rain amounts, and there is no recursion involved. This line can be safely removed.

3. **Index Checking**: The program correctly checks the conditions for the days before and after the current day. However, it uses `break` statements in a way that might prematurely terminate the inner loops. Specifically, if `indis < 0` or `indis >= n`, the loop should continue to the next iteration rather than breaking out of the loop entirely.

4. **Early Termination**: The program prints the index of the first not-so-rainy day it finds and then breaks out of the loop. This is correct according to the problem description, which asks for the earliest not-so-rainy day.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    inp2 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    for i in range(n):
        flag = True
        
        val = inp2[i]
        
        for bef in range(1, x + 1):
            indis = i - bef
            if indis < 0:
                continue
            if val > inp2[indis]:
                flag = False
                break
        
        for aft in range(1, y + 1):
            indis = i + aft
            if indis >= n:
                continue
            if val > inp2[indis]:
                flag = False
                break
        
        if flag:
            print(i + 1)
            break
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling**: Uses `input()` instead of `raw_input()` to ensure compatibility with Python 3.
- **Index Checking**: Uses `continue` instead of `break` when `indis` is out of bounds, ensuring that the inner loops check all required indices.
- **Recursion Limit**: Removed the unnecessary `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)` line.

This corrected program will correctly identify the earliest not-so-rainy day as per the problem description.
