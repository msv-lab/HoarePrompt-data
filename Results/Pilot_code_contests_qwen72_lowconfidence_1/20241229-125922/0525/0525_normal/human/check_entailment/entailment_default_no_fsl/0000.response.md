Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it handles the conditions for a "not-so-rainy" day. Specifically, the program incorrectly breaks out of the loop when it encounters an index that is out of bounds, which can lead to incorrect results. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Break Conditions**: The program uses `break` statements when `indis < 0` or `indis >= n`. This means that if the index goes out of bounds, the loop stops immediately, potentially skipping necessary comparisons. For example, if `x = 2` and `i = 0`, the loop will break after the first iteration because `indis = -1`, even though it should still check the next valid index.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not correctly handle edge cases where the day is close to the start or end of the summer period. For instance, if `x = 2` and `i = 1`, the program will not check the day before `i = 1` because `indis = 0 - 1 = -1`, and it will break the loop prematurely.

3. **Example Failure**: Consider the input:
   ```
   10 2 2
   10 9 6 7 8 3 2 1 4 5
   ```
   The correct output should be `3`, but the program might incorrectly output a different value due to the premature breaking of loops.

To fix this, the program should continue checking valid indices even if some indices go out of bounds. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
    (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    inp2 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        flag = True
        val = inp2[i]
        for bef in range(1, x + 1):
            indis = i - bef
            if 0 <= indis < n:
                if val > inp2[indis]:
                    flag = False
                    break
        if not flag:
            continue
        for aft in range(1, y + 1):
            indis = i + aft
            if 0 <= indis < n:
                if val > inp2[indis]:
                    flag = False
                    break
        if flag:
            print(i + 1)
            break

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly checks all valid indices and only breaks the loop when a valid condition is met. This should handle all potential cases correctly.
