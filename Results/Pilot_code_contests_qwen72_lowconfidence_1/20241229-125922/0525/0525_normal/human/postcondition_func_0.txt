The function reads two lines of input. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` and `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 7`. The second line contains `n` distinct integers, each between `1` and `10^9`. The function then checks each element in the list to see if it is not greater than any of its `x` preceding elements or `y` following elements. If such an element is found, the function prints the 1-based index of this element and terminates. If no such element is found, the function completes without printing anything. The recursion limit is set to 1,000,000, but the function does not use recursion. The final state of the program includes the updated recursion limit and the processed input variables, but the original list `a` is not modified.
