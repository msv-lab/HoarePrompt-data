Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when it is impossible to arrange the students in the buses such that no two students become close friends. Specifically, the program should print `-1` if it is not possible to arrange the students according to the given constraints. However, the current implementation does not correctly detect this condition.

For example, consider the input `3 2 1`:
- According to the problem description, if there are 3 students, 2 buses, and only 1 day, it is impossible to arrange the students such that no two students are in the same bus for all days. The correct output should be `-1`.
- However, the current implementation will print a possible arrangement, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` and how it is used in `func_2`. The function `func_1` is designed to increment the list `a` in a way that simulates a base-`k` number system. If an overflow occurs at the first element, it returns `False`. However, this alone is not sufficient to determine if a valid arrangement is possible. The program should explicitly check if it is possible to arrange the students before attempting to generate the arrangement.

Therefore, the program does not meet the specification for every potential case, making it incorrect.
