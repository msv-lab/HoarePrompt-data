Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \( k = 1 \) and \( n > 1 \). According to the problem description, if there is only one bus and more than one student, it is impossible to arrange the students such that no two students become close friends. However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not check for this specific condition and will attempt to generate an invalid arrangement.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 1 1
```
In this case, the program should output `-1` because it is impossible to arrange 3 students in 1 bus over 1 day without any two students becoming close friends. However, the current implementation will output:
```
1 1 1
```
which is incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this specific case.
