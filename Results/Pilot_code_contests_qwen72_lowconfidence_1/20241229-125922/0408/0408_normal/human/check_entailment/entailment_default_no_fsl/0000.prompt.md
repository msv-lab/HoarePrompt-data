You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Pashmak has been employed in a transportation company. The company has k buses and has a contract with a school which has n students. The school planned to take the students to d different places for d days (each day in one place). Each day the company provides all the buses for the trip. Pashmak has to arrange the students in the buses. He wants to arrange the students in a way that no two students become close friends. In his ridiculous idea, two students will become close friends if and only if they are in the same buses for all d days.

Please help Pashmak with his weird idea. Assume that each bus has an unlimited capacity.

Input

The first line of input contains three space-separated integers n, k, d (1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000; 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Output

If there is no valid arrangement just print -1. Otherwise print d lines, in each of them print n integers. The j-th integer of the i-th line shows which bus the j-th student has to take on the i-th day. You can assume that the buses are numbered from 1 to k.

Examples

Input

3 2 2


Output

1 1 2 
1 2 1 


Input

3 2 1


Output

-1

Note

Note that two students become close friends only if they share a bus each day. But the bus they share can differ from day to day.
Functions with output description for each function:
func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, k):
    carry = 1
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        newval = a[i] + carry
        if newval >= k:
            if i == 0:
                return False
            newval = 0
            carry = 1
        else:
            carry = 0
        a[i] = newval
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list of non-negative integers `a` and a positive integer `k`. It attempts to increment each element of the list from the end towards the beginning, carrying over values if the sum exceeds or equals `k`. If an overflow occurs at the first element (index 0) of the list, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. If the list `a` is empty, the function also returns `False` since the loop does not execute, and the initial carry value of 1 causes an immediate overflow condition. After the function concludes, the list `a` is modified in place, reflecting the incremented values, unless an overflow at the first element triggers an early return.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    (n, k, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = [0] * d
    res = list()
    nextFine = True
    for want in xrange(n):
        if not nextFine:
            print(-1)
            return
        res.append(list((val + 1 for val in a)))
        nextFine = func_1(a, k)
    print('\n'.join((' '.join(map(str, l)) for l in res)))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `d` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. It initializes a list `a` of `d` zeros and an empty list `res`. The function then iterates `n` times, appending a list of `d` elements (each incremented by 1) to `res` on each iteration. After each append, it calls `func_1(a, k)`, and if `func_1` returns `False`, the function prints `-1` and exits immediately. If the loop completes without `func_1` returning `False`, the function prints each list in `res` on a new line. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it implicitly returns `None` after printing the results. Edge cases include when `n` is 0, in which case the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty list, and the function prints nothing.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
