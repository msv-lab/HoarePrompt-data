You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Pashmak has been employed in a transportation company. The company has k buses and has a contract with a school which has n students. The school planned to take the students to d different places for d days (each day in one place). Each day the company provides all the buses for the trip. Pashmak has to arrange the students in the buses. He wants to arrange the students in a way that no two students become close friends. In his ridiculous idea, two students will become close friends if and only if they are in the same buses for all d days.

Please help Pashmak with his weird idea. Assume that each bus has an unlimited capacity.

Input

The first line of input contains three space-separated integers n, k, d (1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000; 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Output

If there is no valid arrangement just print -1. Otherwise print d lines, in each of them print n integers. The j-th integer of the i-th line shows which bus the j-th student has to take on the i-th day. You can assume that the buses are numbered from 1 to k.

Examples

Input

3 2 2


Output

1 1 2 
1 2 1 


Input

3 2 1


Output

-1

Note

Note that two students become close friends only if they share a bus each day. But the bus they share can differ from day to day.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, k):
    carry = 1
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        newval = a[i] + carry
        if newval >= k:
            if i == 0:
                return False
            newval = 0
            carry = 1
        else:
            carry = 0
        a[i] = newval
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (n, k, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = [0] * d
    res = list()
    nextFine = True
    for want in xrange(n):
        if not nextFine:
            print(-1)
            return
        res.append(list((val + 1 for val in a)))
        nextFine = func_1(a, k)
    print('\n'.join((' '.join(map(str, l)) for l in res)))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
