Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Handling of `raw_input()`**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This is a minor issue but should be corrected for compatibility with Python 3.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` is designed to distribute students across buses over multiple days. However, the algorithm does not correctly handle cases where it is impossible to arrange the students such that no two students are in the same bus for all days.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the edge case where it is impossible to distribute the students as required. Specifically, if \( k < 2 \) or \( n > k^d \), it is impossible to ensure that no two students are in the same bus for all days. The program should output `-1` in such cases.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `3 2 1`, the program should output `-1` because it is impossible to arrange 3 students in 2 buses for 1 day without having at least two students in the same bus. However, the program does not handle this case correctly and may produce an invalid output.

### Corrected Program:
To ensure the program meets the problem description, it should include a check for the impossibility condition and use the correct input function for Python 3. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(a, k):
    carry = 1
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        newval = a[i] + carry
        
        if newval >= k:
            if i == 0:
                return False
            newval = 0
            carry = 1
        else:
            carry = 0
        
        a[i] = newval
        
    return True

def func_2():
    n, k, d = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Check if it's impossible to arrange the students
    if k < 2 or n > k**d:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    a = [0] * d
    res = []
    nextFine = True
    for want in range(n):
        if not nextFine:
            print(-1)
            return
        
        res.append([val + 1 for val in a])
        
        nextFine = func_1(a, k)
        
    print('\n'.join(' '.join(map(str, l)) for l in res))

func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Impossibility Check**: Before attempting to arrange the students, the program checks if \( k < 2 \) or \( n > k^d \). If either condition is true, it prints `-1` and returns.
- **Input Function**: The program uses `input()` instead of `raw_input()` to ensure compatibility with Python 3.
- **Correct Distribution**: The rest of the logic ensures that students are distributed across buses in a way that no two students are in the same bus for all days.

By making these changes, the program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
