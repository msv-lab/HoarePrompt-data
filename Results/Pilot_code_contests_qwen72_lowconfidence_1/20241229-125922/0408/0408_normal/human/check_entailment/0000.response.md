Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. It uses two functions: `func_1` to increment the bus assignments for the next student, ensuring no two students are in the same bus configuration across all days, and `func_2` to handle the input and output according to the problem's specifications. 

- `func_1` ensures that the bus assignments cycle through all possible configurations without repeating a configuration for any two students across all days. If it reaches a point where no new configuration can be generated (i.e., all configurations have been used), it returns `False`, indicating that it is impossible to arrange the students as required.
- `func_2` reads the input, initializes the bus assignments, and iterates over the number of students, generating a new bus assignment for each student using `func_1`. If at any point `func_1` returns `False`, it prints `-1` and exits, correctly handling the case where no valid arrangement is possible.

The program handles edge cases such as when the number of students is greater than the number of possible bus configurations (i.e., \(k^d\)), which would make it impossible to arrange the students without some pairs being in the same bus configuration across all days. The program correctly outputs `-1` in such cases. Given these points, the program appears to meet the problem's requirements for all potential cases.
