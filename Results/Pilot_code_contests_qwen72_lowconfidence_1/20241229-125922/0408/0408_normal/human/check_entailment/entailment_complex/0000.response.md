Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `k < n` and `d = 1`. According to the problem description, if it is impossible to arrange the students such that no two students become close friends, the program should output `-1`. However, the current implementation does not correctly detect this scenario and may produce an invalid arrangement.

For example, consider the input `3 2 1`. The program should output `-1` because it is impossible to arrange 3 students in 2 buses for 1 day such that no two students are in the same bus. However, the current implementation will attempt to assign the students to buses and may output something like:

```
1 1 2
```

This is incorrect because students 1 and 2 are in the same bus on the only day, making them close friends. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this case.
