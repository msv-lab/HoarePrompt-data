You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Pashmak has been employed in a transportation company. The company has k buses and has a contract with a school which has n students. The school planned to take the students to d different places for d days (each day in one place). Each day the company provides all the buses for the trip. Pashmak has to arrange the students in the buses. He wants to arrange the students in a way that no two students become close friends. In his ridiculous idea, two students will become close friends if and only if they are in the same buses for all d days.

Please help Pashmak with his weird idea. Assume that each bus has an unlimited capacity.

Input

The first line of input contains three space-separated integers n, k, d (1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000; 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Output

If there is no valid arrangement just print -1. Otherwise print d lines, in each of them print n integers. The j-th integer of the i-th line shows which bus the j-th student has to take on the i-th day. You can assume that the buses are numbered from 1 to k.

Examples

Input

3 2 2


Output

1 1 2 
1 2 1 


Input

3 2 1


Output

-1

Note

Note that two students become close friends only if they share a bus each day. But the bus they share can differ from day to day.
Annotated Functions:
func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers, and k is a positive integer.
def func_1(a, k):
    carry = 1
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        newval = a[i] + carry
        
        if newval >= k:
            if i == 0:
                return False
            newval = 0
            carry = 1
        else:
            carry = 0
        
        a[i] = newval
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list of non-negative integers where each element has been updated according to the rules defined in the loop. `k` is a positive integer. `carry` is 0 if no overflow occurred during the last update, otherwise, if an overflow occurred at the first element of `a` (index 0), the function returns `False`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `a` is an empty list), `carry` remains 1, and the function does not return `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of non-negative integers `a` and a positive integer `k`. It attempts to increment each element of the list from the end towards the beginning, carrying over values if the sum exceeds or equals `k`. If an overflow occurs at the first element (index 0) of the list, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. If the list `a` is empty, the function also returns `False` since the loop does not execute, and the initial carry value of 1 causes an immediate overflow condition. After the function concludes, the list `a` is modified in place, reflecting the incremented values, unless an overflow at the first element triggers an early return.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    n, k, d = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = [0] * d
    res = list()
    nextFine = True
    for want in xrange(n):
        if not nextFine:
            print(-1)
            return
        
        res.append(list(val + 1 for val in a))
        
        nextFine = func_1(a, k)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is a list containing `n` lists of `d` ones, `nextFine` is the result of the last call to `func_1(a, k)`, `want` is `n - 1`. If `nextFine` becomes `False` at any point during the loop, the loop terminates early, `res` contains fewer than `n` lists, and the program returns `-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty list, `nextFine` remains `True`, and `want` is undefined.
    print('\n'.join(' '.join(map(str, l)) for l in res))
#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `d` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. It initializes a list `a` of `d` zeros and an empty list `res`. The function then iterates `n` times, appending a list of `d` elements (each incremented by 1) to `res` on each iteration. After each append, it calls `func_1(a, k)`, and if `func_1` returns `False`, the function prints `-1` and exits immediately. If the loop completes without `func_1` returning `False`, the function prints each list in `res` on a new line. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it implicitly returns `None` after printing the results. Edge cases include when `n` is 0, in which case the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty list, and the function prints nothing.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
