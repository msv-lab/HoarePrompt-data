You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Pashmak has been employed in a transportation company. The company has k buses and has a contract with a school which has n students. The school planned to take the students to d different places for d days (each day in one place). Each day the company provides all the buses for the trip. Pashmak has to arrange the students in the buses. He wants to arrange the students in a way that no two students become close friends. In his ridiculous idea, two students will become close friends if and only if they are in the same buses for all d days.

Please help Pashmak with his weird idea. Assume that each bus has an unlimited capacity.

Input

The first line of input contains three space-separated integers n, k, d (1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000; 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Output

If there is no valid arrangement just print -1. Otherwise print d lines, in each of them print n integers. The j-th integer of the i-th line shows which bus the j-th student has to take on the i-th day. You can assume that the buses are numbered from 1 to k.

Examples

Input

3 2 2


Output

1 1 2 
1 2 1 


Input

3 2 1


Output

-1

Note

Note that two students become close friends only if they share a bus each day. But the bus they share can differ from day to day.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, k):
    carry = 1
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        newval = a[i] + carry
        if newval >= k:
            if i == 0:
                return False
            newval = 0
            carry = 1
        else:
            carry = 0
        a[i] = newval
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (n, k, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = [0] * d
    res = list()
    nextFine = True
    for want in xrange(n):
        if not nextFine:
            print(-1)
            return
        res.append(list((val + 1 for val in a)))
        nextFine = func_1(a, k)
    print('\n'.join((' '.join(map(str, l)) for l in res)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. It uses two functions: `func_1` to increment the bus assignments for the next student, ensuring no two students are in the same bus configuration across all days, and `func_2` to handle the input and output according to the problem's specifications. 

- `func_1` ensures that the bus assignments cycle through all possible configurations without repeating a configuration for any two students across all days. If it reaches a point where no new configuration can be generated (i.e., all configurations have been used), it returns `False`, indicating that it is impossible to arrange the students as required.
- `func_2` reads the input, initializes the bus assignments, and iterates over the number of students, generating a new bus assignment for each student using `func_1`. If at any point `func_1` returns `False`, it prints `-1` and exits, correctly handling the case where no valid arrangement is possible.

The program handles edge cases such as when the number of students is greater than the number of possible bus configurations (i.e., \(k^d\)), which would make it impossible to arrange the students without some pairs being in the same bus configuration across all days. The program correctly outputs `-1` in such cases. Given these points, the program appears to meet the problem's requirements for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers, and k is a positive integer.
def func_1(a, k):
    carry = 1
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        newval = a[i] + carry
        
        if newval >= k:
            if i == 0:
                return False
            newval = 0
            carry = 1
        else:
            carry = 0
        
        a[i] = newval
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list of non-negative integers where each element has been updated according to the rules defined in the loop. `k` is a positive integer. `carry` is 0 if no overflow occurred during the last update, otherwise, if an overflow occurred at the first element of `a` (index 0), the function returns `False`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `a` is an empty list), `carry` remains 1, and the function does not return `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of non-negative integers `a` and a positive integer `k`. It attempts to increment each element of the list from the end towards the beginning, carrying over values if the sum exceeds or equals `k`. If an overflow occurs at the first element (index 0) of the list, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. If the list `a` is empty, the function also returns `False` since the loop does not execute, and the initial carry value of 1 causes an immediate overflow condition. After the function concludes, the list `a` is modified in place, reflecting the incremented values, unless an overflow at the first element triggers an early return.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    n, k, d = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = [0] * d
    res = list()
    nextFine = True
    for want in xrange(n):
        if not nextFine:
            print(-1)
            return
        
        res.append(list(val + 1 for val in a))
        
        nextFine = func_1(a, k)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is a list containing `n` lists of `d` ones, `nextFine` is the result of the last call to `func_1(a, k)`, `want` is `n - 1`. If `nextFine` becomes `False` at any point during the loop, the loop terminates early, `res` contains fewer than `n` lists, and the program returns `-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty list, `nextFine` remains `True`, and `want` is undefined.
    print('\n'.join(' '.join(map(str, l)) for l in res))
#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `d` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. It initializes a list `a` of `d` zeros and an empty list `res`. The function then iterates `n` times, appending a list of `d` elements (each incremented by 1) to `res` on each iteration. After each append, it calls `func_1(a, k)`, and if `func_1` returns `False`, the function prints `-1` and exits immediately. If the loop completes without `func_1` returning `False`, the function prints each list in `res` on a new line. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it implicitly returns `None` after printing the results. Edge cases include when `n` is 0, in which case the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty list, and the function prints nothing.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
