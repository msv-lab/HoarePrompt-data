Final: **True**

Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `k`, and `d` using `raw_input()` and splits them into integers. This matches the problem's input format.

2. **Initial Setup**: The program initializes a list `a` of length `d` with all zeros. This list represents the current assignment of students to buses for each day. This initialization is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

3. **Main Loop**: The program iterates `n` times, once for each student. For each student, it appends the current state of `a` (incremented by 1 to match the bus numbering from 1 to `k`) to the result list `res`. This ensures that each student's bus assignment for each day is recorded.

4. **Increment Function**: The function `func_1(a, k)` is used to increment the list `a` in a way that ensures no two students are in the same bus for all `d` days. It works by carrying over the increment when a value reaches `k`, similar to how numbers are incremented in a base-k number system. The annotations confirm that this function correctly updates the list `a` and returns `False` if an overflow occurs at the first element of `a`, indicating that it is impossible to assign the students to buses without two students being in the same bus for all `d` days.

5. **Termination Condition**: If `func_1(a, k)` returns `False`, it means that the increment operation failed, indicating that it is impossible to assign the students to buses without two students being in the same bus for all `d` days. In this case, the program prints `-1` and exits. This is the correct behavior as specified in the problem description.

6. **Output**: If the loop completes successfully, the program prints the result list `res`, formatted as required. The annotations confirm that the program correctly formats and prints the result.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is 1 and `d` is greater than 1, or when `n` is greater than `k^d`. In these cases, it correctly prints `-1`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior at each step. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
