Final: **True**

Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `k`, and `d` using `raw_input()` and splits them into integers. This aligns with the problem's input format.

2. **Initial Setup**: The program initializes a list `a` of length `d` with all zeros. This list represents the current assignment of students to buses for each day, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

3. **Main Loop**: The program iterates `n` times, once for each student. For each student, it appends the current state of `a` (incremented by 1 to match the bus numbering from 1 to `k`) to the result list `res`. This ensures that each student is assigned to a bus for each day.

4. **Increment Function**: The function `func_1(a, k)` is used to increment the list `a` in a way that ensures no two students are in the same bus for all `d` days. It works by carrying over the increment when a value reaches `k`, similar to how numbers are incremented in a base-k number system. This is crucial for ensuring that no two students are in the same bus for all `d` days.

5. **Termination Condition**: If `func_1(a, k)` returns `False`, it means that the increment operation failed, indicating that it is impossible to assign the students to buses without two students being in the same bus for all `d` days. In this case, the program prints `-1` and exits. This handles the edge case where the number of students `n` exceeds the possible unique assignments given `k` and `d`.

6. **Output**: If the loop completes successfully, the program prints the result list `res`, formatted as required. This matches the expected output format.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as when `n` is 0, in which case the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty list, and the function prints nothing. This is consistent with the problem's requirements.

8. **Output Hints**: The output hints confirm that the program reads the input correctly, initializes the necessary lists, iterates through the students, and prints the results or `-1` as appropriate. This aligns with the problem's requirements and the logic implemented in the program.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate, and the program is correct.
