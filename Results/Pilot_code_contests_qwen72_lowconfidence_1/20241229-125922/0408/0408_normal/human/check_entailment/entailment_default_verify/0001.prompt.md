You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Pashmak has been employed in a transportation company. The company has k buses and has a contract with a school which has n students. The school planned to take the students to d different places for d days (each day in one place). Each day the company provides all the buses for the trip. Pashmak has to arrange the students in the buses. He wants to arrange the students in a way that no two students become close friends. In his ridiculous idea, two students will become close friends if and only if they are in the same buses for all d days.

Please help Pashmak with his weird idea. Assume that each bus has an unlimited capacity.

Input

The first line of input contains three space-separated integers n, k, d (1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000; 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Output

If there is no valid arrangement just print -1. Otherwise print d lines, in each of them print n integers. The j-th integer of the i-th line shows which bus the j-th student has to take on the i-th day. You can assume that the buses are numbered from 1 to k.

Examples

Input

3 2 2


Output

1 1 2 
1 2 1 


Input

3 2 1


Output

-1

Note

Note that two students become close friends only if they share a bus each day. But the bus they share can differ from day to day.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, k):
    carry = 1
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        newval = a[i] + carry
        if newval >= k:
            if i == 0:
                return False
            newval = 0
            carry = 1
        else:
            carry = 0
        a[i] = newval
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (n, k, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = [0] * d
    res = list()
    nextFine = True
    for want in xrange(n):
        if not nextFine:
            print(-1)
            return
        res.append(list((val + 1 for val in a)))
        nextFine = func_1(a, k)
    print('\n'.join((' '.join(map(str, l)) for l in res)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values `n`, `k`, and `d` using `raw_input()` and splits them into integers. This is appropriate for the problem's input format.

2. **Initial Setup**: It initializes a list `a` of length `d` with all zeros. This list represents the current assignment of students to buses for each day.

3. **Main Loop**: The program iterates `n` times, once for each student. For each student, it appends the current state of `a` (incremented by 1 to match the bus numbering from 1 to `k`) to the result list `res`.

4. **Increment Function**: The function `func_1(a, k)` is used to increment the list `a` in a way that ensures no two students are in the same bus for all `d` days. It works by carrying over the increment when a value reaches `k`, similar to how numbers are incremented in a base-k number system.

5. **Termination Condition**: If `func_1(a, k)` returns `False`, it means that the increment operation failed, indicating that it is impossible to assign the students to buses without two students being in the same bus for all `d` days. In this case, the program prints `-1` and exits.

6. **Output**: If the loop completes successfully, the program prints the result list `res`, formatted as required.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is 1 and `d` is greater than 1, or when `n` is greater than `k^d`. In these cases, it correctly prints `-1`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : This function reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `d` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. It initializes a list `a` of `d` zeros and an empty list `res`. The function then iterates `n` times, appending a list of `d` elements (each incremented by 1) to `res` on each iteration. After each append, it calls `func_1(a, k)`, and if `func_1` returns `False`, the function prints `-1` and exits immediately. If the loop completes without `func_1` returning `False`, the function prints each list in `res` on a new line. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it implicitly returns `None` after printing the results. Edge cases include when `n` is 0, in which case the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty list, and the function prints nothing.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
