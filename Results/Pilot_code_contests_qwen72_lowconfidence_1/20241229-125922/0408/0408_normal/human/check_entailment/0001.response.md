Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values `n`, `k`, and `d` using `raw_input()` and splits them into integers. This is appropriate for the problem's input format.

2. **Initial Setup**: It initializes a list `a` of length `d` with all zeros. This list represents the current assignment of students to buses for each day.

3. **Main Loop**: The program iterates `n` times, once for each student. For each student, it appends the current state of `a` (incremented by 1 to match the bus numbering from 1 to `k`) to the result list `res`.

4. **Increment Function**: The function `func_1(a, k)` is used to increment the list `a` in a way that ensures no two students are in the same bus for all `d` days. It works by carrying over the increment when a value reaches `k`, similar to how numbers are incremented in a base-k number system.

5. **Termination Condition**: If `func_1(a, k)` returns `False`, it means that the increment operation failed, indicating that it is impossible to assign the students to buses without two students being in the same bus for all `d` days. In this case, the program prints `-1` and exits.

6. **Output**: If the loop completes successfully, the program prints the result list `res`, formatted as required.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is 1 and `d` is greater than 1, or when `n` is greater than `k^d`. In these cases, it correctly prints `-1`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
