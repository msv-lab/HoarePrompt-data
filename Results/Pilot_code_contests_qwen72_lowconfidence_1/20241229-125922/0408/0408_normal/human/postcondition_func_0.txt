The function `func_1` accepts a list of non-negative integers `a` and a positive integer `k`. It attempts to increment each element of the list from the end towards the beginning, carrying over values if the sum exceeds or equals `k`. If an overflow occurs at the first element (index 0) of the list, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. If the list `a` is empty, the function also returns `False` since the loop does not execute, and the initial carry value of 1 causes an immediate overflow condition. After the function concludes, the list `a` is modified in place, reflecting the incremented values, unless an overflow at the first element triggers an early return.
