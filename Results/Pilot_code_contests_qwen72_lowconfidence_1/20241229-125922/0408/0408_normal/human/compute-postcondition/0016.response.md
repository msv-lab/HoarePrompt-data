The code assigns the return value of `func_1(a, k)` to `nextFine`. Based on the initial state, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `k` is an integer within the specified range, and `func_1` is called with these arguments. The value of `nextFine` is determined by the function `func_1`, which could return `True` or `False`.

If `nextFine` is `False`, the program returns `nextFine`. This means that the value of `nextFine` is `False`, and the program's execution ends here, returning `False`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is a list containing two lists of `d` ones, `nextFine` is `False`, `want` is 1, the program returns `False`.**
