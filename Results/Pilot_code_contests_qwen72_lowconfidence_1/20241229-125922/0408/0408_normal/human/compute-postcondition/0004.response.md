To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

### Given Conditions:
- `n`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `a` is a list of `d` zeros.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `nextFine` is `True`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for want in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop uses `xrange(n)`, which generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `want` will take values from 0 to `n-1` during each iteration.

### States to Adjust:
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The other variables (`k`, `d`, `a`, `res`, and `nextFine`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they should be consistent with the given conditions.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is an empty list, `nextFine` is `True`, `want` is 0**
