The variable `nextFine` is set to `True`. This introduces a new boolean variable into the state without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is an empty list, `nextFine` is `True`**
