The code snippet appends a new list to `res`, which is constructed by adding 1 to each element of the list `a`. Given that `a` is initially a list of `d` zeros, the new list appended to `res` will contain `d` elements, each being 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is a list containing one list of `d` ones, `nextFine` is `True`, `want` is 0**.
