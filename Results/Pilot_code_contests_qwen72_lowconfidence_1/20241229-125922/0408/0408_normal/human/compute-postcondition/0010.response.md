The code snippet calls the function `func_1(a, k)`, and assigns its return value to the variable `nextFine`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine its exact behavior or the value it returns. However, since the initial state specifies that `nextFine` is `True`, and assuming `func_1` does not modify the global state (such as the variables `n`, `k`, `d`, `a`, `res`, or `want`), the only change in the output state will be the potential update to the value of `nextFine`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is a list containing one list of `d` ones, `nextFine` is the return value of `func_1(a, k)`, `want` is 0**.
