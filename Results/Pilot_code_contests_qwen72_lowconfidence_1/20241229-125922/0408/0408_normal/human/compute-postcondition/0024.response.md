The given Python code snippet prints each sublist within `res` as a space-separated string, and each of these strings is printed on a new line.

- `res` is a list containing `n` lists of `d` ones.
- The `print` function will iterate over each list `l` in `res`, convert each element in `l` to a string, join these strings with a space, and then join all these space-separated strings with a newline character (`\n`).

Given the initial state, the output will be a formatted string where each line represents one of the sublists in `res`, with each sublist's elements separated by spaces.

Since this is a print statement, no variables are modified by this code. The only effect is the printing of the content of `res`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is a list containing `n` lists of `d` ones, `nextFine` is the result of the last call to `func_1(a, k)`, `want` is `n - 1`. If `nextFine` becomes `False` at any point during the loop, the loop terminates early, `res` contains fewer than `n` lists, and the program returns `-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty list, `nextFine` remains `True`, and `want` is undefined.**
