According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `want` and the condition `want < n`. At the end of the last iteration, `want` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. In the `for` loop, `want` is incremented by 1 at each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `want` must be 1 and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is a list containing one list of `d` ones, `nextFine` is the return value of `func_1(a, k)`, `want` is 1**.
