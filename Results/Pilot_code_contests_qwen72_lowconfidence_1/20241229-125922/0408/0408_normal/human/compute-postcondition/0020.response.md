Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is a list containing two lists of `d` ones, `nextFine` is `False`, and `want` is 2. If `nextFine` is `False`, the program returns nothing.***
