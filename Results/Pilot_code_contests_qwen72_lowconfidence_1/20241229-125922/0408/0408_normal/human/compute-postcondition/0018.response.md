The code snippet `print(-1)` prints `-1` to the console and does not alter the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is a list containing two lists of `d` ones, `nextFine` is `False`, `want` is 2.**
