Functionality: ** This function reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `d` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. It initializes a list `a` of `d` zeros and an empty list `res`. The function then iterates `n` times, appending a list of `d` elements (each incremented by 1) to `res` on each iteration. After each append, it calls `func_1(a, k)`, and if `func_1` returns `False`, the function prints `-1` and exits immediately. If the loop completes without `func_1` returning `False`, the function prints each list in `res` on a new line. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it implicitly returns `None` after printing the results. Edge cases include when `n` is 0, in which case the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty list, and the function prints nothing. **
