The provided code snippet `print(-1)` outputs `-1` to the console. This operation does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `d`, `a`, `res`, `nextFine`, and `want` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is an empty list, `nextFine` is `False`, `want` is 0**
