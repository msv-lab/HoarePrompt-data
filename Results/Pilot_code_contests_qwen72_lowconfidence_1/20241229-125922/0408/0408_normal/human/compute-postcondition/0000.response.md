The provided Python code snippet uses `raw_input()` to read a line of input from the user and then splits it into three parts, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are assigned to the variables `n`, `k`, and `d` respectively. Since the initial state already specifies that `n`, `k`, and `d` are integers within certain ranges, the new values assigned to these variables will also adhere to these constraints.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `n`, `k`, and `d` are assigned new integer values from user input.**
