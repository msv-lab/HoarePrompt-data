The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `k`, which is a positive integer. The function returns `False` in three cases and `True` in one case. Without specific conditions for each case, we can generalize that the function evaluates some condition related to the list `a` and the integer `k`, and based on this evaluation, it returns either `True` or `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a` and a positive integer `k`. It returns `True` under certain conditions and `False` otherwise.**
