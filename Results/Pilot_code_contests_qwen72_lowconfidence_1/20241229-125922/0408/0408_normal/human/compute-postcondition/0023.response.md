Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `d` zeros, `res` is a list containing `n` lists of `d` ones, `nextFine` is the result of the last call to `func_1(a, k)`, `want` is `n - 1`. If `nextFine` becomes `False` at any point during the loop, the loop terminates early, `res` contains fewer than `n` lists, and the program returns `-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty list, `nextFine` remains `True`, and `want` is undefined.**
