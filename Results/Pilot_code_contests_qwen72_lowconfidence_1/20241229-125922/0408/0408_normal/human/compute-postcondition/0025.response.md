The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context and the output cases, it internally uses parameters `n`, `k`, and `d`, which are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.

Output:
- **Case_1:** The program returns `None`.
- **Case_2:** The program returns `nextFine`, which is the result of calling `func_1(a, k)`, where `a` is a list containing `d` zeros, and `k` is an integer within the specified range.
- **Case_3:** The program returns nothing (an empty return).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is as follows:
Functionality: **The function does not explicitly accept any parameters but internally uses integers `n`, `k`, and `d` constrained such that 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. It may return `None`, the result of `func_1(a, k)` where `a` is a list of `d` zeros, or nothing (an empty return).**
