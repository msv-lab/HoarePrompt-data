Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `len(a) - 3`, and `carry` is either 0 or 1. If `newval` (which is `a[len(a) - 3] + carry`) is greater than or equal to `k`, the second-to-last element of `a` is updated to `a[len(a) - 2] + carry`, `carry` is 1, `newval` is 0, and if `i` (which is `len(a) - 3`) equals 0, the program returns False. Otherwise, the second-to-last element of `a` is updated to `newval` (which is `a[len(a) - 2] + carry`), `carry` is 0, and if `newval` is greater than or equal to `k`, the last element of `a` is 0.***
