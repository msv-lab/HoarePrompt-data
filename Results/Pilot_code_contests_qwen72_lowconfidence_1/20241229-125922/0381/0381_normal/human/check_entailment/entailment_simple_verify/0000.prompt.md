You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N squares aligned in a row. The i-th square from the left contains an integer a_i.

Initially, all the squares are white. Snuke will perform the following operation some number of times:

* Select K consecutive squares. Then, paint all of them white, or paint all of them black. Here, the colors of the squares are overwritten.



After Snuke finishes performing the operation, the score will be calculated as the sum of the integers contained in the black squares. Find the maximum possible score.

Constraints

* 1≤N≤10^5
* 1≤K≤N
* a_i is an integer.
* |a_i|≤10^9

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    total = [0] * (n + 1)
    asum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in xrange(n):
        asum[i + 1] = asum[i] + a[i]
        if a[i] > 0:
            total[i + 1] = total[i] + a[i]
        else:
            total[i + 1] = total[i]
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(n - k + 1):
        tmp = asum[i + k] - asum[i]
        ans = max(ans, tmp + total[i] + total[n] - total[i + k], total[i] + total[n] - total[i + k])
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It calculates the maximum possible score by considering the sum of positive values in the array and the optimal segments of length `K` that can be painted black to maximize the score. The logic for calculating the prefix sums (`asum`) and the cumulative positive sums (`total`) is sound. The algorithm iterates through all possible segments of length `K` and updates the maximum score accordingly. This approach ensures that the program handles all constraints and edge cases effectively, including cases where all values are negative, all values are positive, or a mix of positive and negative values. No counterexample has been found where the program fails to produce the correct output.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, K is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N, and a is a list of N integers where each a_i satisfies |a_i| ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    total = [0] * (n + 1)
    asum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in xrange(n):
        asum[i + 1] = asum[i] + a[i]
        
        if a[i] > 0:
            total[i + 1] = total[i] + a[i]
        else:
            total[i + 1] = total[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` where `total[i]` is the sum of all positive integers in `a[:i]` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `asum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(n - k + 1):
        tmp = asum[i + k] - asum[i]
        
        ans = max(ans, tmp + total[i] + total[n] - total[i + k], total[i] + total[n
            ] - total[i + k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` where `total[i]` is the sum of all positive integers in `a[:i]` for \(0 \leq i \leq n\), `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `asum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for \(0 \leq i \leq n\), `ans` is the maximum value of \(\max\left(\text{asum}[i + k] - \text{asum}[i] + \text{total}[i] + \text{total}[n] - \text{total}[i + k], \text{total}[i] + \text{total}[n] - \text{total}[i + k]\right)\) for \(0 \leq i \leq n - k\). If `n < k`, `ans` is 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
