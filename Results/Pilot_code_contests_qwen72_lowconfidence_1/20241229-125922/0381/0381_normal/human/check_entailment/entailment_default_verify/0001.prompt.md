You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N squares aligned in a row. The i-th square from the left contains an integer a_i.

Initially, all the squares are white. Snuke will perform the following operation some number of times:

* Select K consecutive squares. Then, paint all of them white, or paint all of them black. Here, the colors of the squares are overwritten.



After Snuke finishes performing the operation, the score will be calculated as the sum of the integers contained in the black squares. Find the maximum possible score.

Constraints

* 1≤N≤10^5
* 1≤K≤N
* a_i is an integer.
* |a_i|≤10^9

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    total = [0] * (n + 1)
    asum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in xrange(n):
        asum[i + 1] = asum[i] + a[i]
        if a[i] > 0:
            total[i + 1] = total[i] + a[i]
        else:
            total[i + 1] = total[i]
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(n - k + 1):
        tmp = asum[i + k] - asum[i]
        ans = max(ans, tmp + total[i] + total[n] - total[i + k], total[i] + total[n] - total[i + k])
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the maximum possible score. Specifically, the line:

```python
ans = max(ans, tmp + total[i] + total[n] - total[i + k], total[i] + total[n] - total[i + k])
```

This line incorrectly assumes that the maximum score can be calculated by considering only the sum of positive values up to the current segment and the remaining segment. However, this approach fails to correctly handle cases where the optimal solution involves painting multiple segments black, especially when the segments contain both positive and negative values.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
6 2
-1 2 -3 4 -5 6
```

The expected output should be `12`, which can be achieved by painting the segments `[2, -3]` and `[4, -5]` black. However, the program outputs `11`, which is incorrect.

### Explanation of the Counterexample:
- The array `a` is `[-1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6]`.
- The optimal solution is to paint the segments `[2, -3]` and `[4, -5]` black, resulting in a score of `2 + 4 + 6 = 12`.
- The program, however, fails to consider the possibility of multiple segments being painted black and instead focuses on a single segment, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers `N` and `K` from the input, followed by a list `a` of `N` integers. It calculates the maximum possible sum of a subarray of length `K` in `a`, while also considering the sum of positive integers outside this subarray. The function then prints this maximum sum. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `N`, `K`, and `a` are unchanged, and the result of the computation is printed to the console. If `N < K`, the function will print `0`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
