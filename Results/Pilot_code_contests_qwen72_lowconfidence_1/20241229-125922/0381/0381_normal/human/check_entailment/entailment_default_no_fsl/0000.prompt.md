You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N squares aligned in a row. The i-th square from the left contains an integer a_i.

Initially, all the squares are white. Snuke will perform the following operation some number of times:

* Select K consecutive squares. Then, paint all of them white, or paint all of them black. Here, the colors of the squares are overwritten.



After Snuke finishes performing the operation, the score will be calculated as the sum of the integers contained in the black squares. Find the maximum possible score.

Constraints

* 1≤N≤10^5
* 1≤K≤N
* a_i is an integer.
* |a_i|≤10^9

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
a_1 a_2 ... a_N


Output

Print the maximum possible score.

Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    total = [0] * (n + 1)
    asum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in xrange(n):
        asum[i + 1] = asum[i] + a[i]
        if a[i] > 0:
            total[i + 1] = total[i] + a[i]
        else:
            total[i + 1] = total[i]
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(n - k + 1):
        tmp = asum[i + k] - asum[i]
        ans = max(ans, tmp + total[i] + total[n] - total[i + k], total[i] + total[n] - total[i + k])
    print(ans)


```
Output hints: The function reads two integers `N` and `K` from the input, followed by a list `a` of `N` integers. It calculates the maximum possible sum of a subarray of length `K` in `a`, while also considering the sum of positive integers outside this subarray. The function then prints this maximum sum. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `N`, `K`, and `a` are unchanged, and the result of the computation is printed to the console. If `N < K`, the function will print `0`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
