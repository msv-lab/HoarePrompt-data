The code snippet updates the `total` list at index `i + 1` by adding the value of `a[i]` to `total[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n
- `a` is a list of integers read from input with length `n`
- `total` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0
- `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` with `asum[1] = a[0]` and all other elements initialized to 0
- `i` is 0
- The current value of `a[i]` is greater than 0

The code snippet:
```python
total[i + 1] = total[i] + a[i]
```

Updates the `total` list at index `1` (since `i` is 0) to be the sum of `total[0]` (which is 0) and `a[0]`.

Since `a[0]` is greater than 0, let's denote `a[0]` as `a_0` for clarity. The updated value of `total[1]` is `a_0`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` with `total[1] = a[0]` and all other elements initialized to 0, `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` with `asum[1] = a[0]` and all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than 0.**
