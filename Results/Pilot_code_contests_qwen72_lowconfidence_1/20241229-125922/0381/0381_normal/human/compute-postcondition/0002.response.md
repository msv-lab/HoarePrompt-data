The code initializes a list named `total` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This means `total` is now a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0**
