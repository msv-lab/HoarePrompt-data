The value of `tmp` is updated to `asum[i + k] - asum[i]`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1, so the new value of `tmp` is `asum[1 + k] - asum[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` where `total[i]` is the sum of all positive integers in `a[:i]` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `asum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `ans` is max(0, `asum[k] + total[n] - total[k]`, `total[n] - total[k]`), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `tmp` is `asum[1 + k] - asum[1]`**
