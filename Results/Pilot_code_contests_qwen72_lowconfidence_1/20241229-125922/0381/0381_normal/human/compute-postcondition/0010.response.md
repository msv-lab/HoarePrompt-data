Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` with `total[0] = 0` and `total[1] = a[0]` if `a[0] > 0` or `total[1] = 0` if `a[0] <= 0`, `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` with `asum[1] = a[0]` and all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is 0.***
