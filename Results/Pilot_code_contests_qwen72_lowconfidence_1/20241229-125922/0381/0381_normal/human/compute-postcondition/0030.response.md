The code snippet updates the value of `tmp` to `asum[i + k] - asum[i]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n
- `a` is a list of integers with length `n`
- `total` is a list of length `n + 1` where `total[i]` is the sum of all positive integers in `a[:i]` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n
- `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `asum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n
- `ans` is max(max(0, asum[k] + total[n] - total[k], total[n] - total[k]), (asum[1 + k] - asum[1]) + total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k], total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k])
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than `k + 1`
- `tmp` is `asum[1 + k] - asum[1]`

The new value of `tmp` is calculated as `asum[i + k] - asum[i]`. Since `i` is 2, this becomes `asum[2 + k] - asum[2]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` where `total[i]` is the sum of all positive integers in `a[:i]` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `asum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `ans` is max(max(0, asum[k] + total[n] - total[k], total[n] - total[k]), (asum[1 + k] - asum[1]) + total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k], total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k]), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`, `tmp` is `asum[2 + k] - asum[2]`**
