To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `a` is a list of integers with length `n`.
- `total` is a list of length `n + 1` where `total[i]` is the sum of all positive integers in `a[:i]` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.
- `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `asum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.
- `ans` is the maximum of the following expressions:
  - `max(0, asum[k] + total[n] - total[k], total[n] - total[k])`
  - `(asum[1 + k] - asum[1]) + total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k]`
  - `total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k]`
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
- `tmp` is `asum[1 + k] - asum[1]`.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for i in xrange(n - k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - k + 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The loop condition `i < n - k + 1` must still hold true for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, `n - k + 1` must be greater than 2, which implies `n - k + 1 > 2` or `n - k > 1` or `n > k + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` where `total[i]` is the sum of all positive integers in `a[:i]` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `asum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `ans` is max(max(0, asum[k] + total[n] - total[k], total[n] - total[k]), (asum[1 + k] - asum[1]) + total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k], total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k]), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`, `tmp` is `asum[1 + k] - asum[1]`**
