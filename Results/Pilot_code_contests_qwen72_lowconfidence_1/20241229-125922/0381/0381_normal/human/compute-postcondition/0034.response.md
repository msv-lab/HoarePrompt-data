The function `func` is described with certain parameter constraints but lacks explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, we can infer that the function likely accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `a`. 

- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\).
- `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N\).
- `a` is a list of `N` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(|a_i| \leq 10^9\).

Since the output description is missing, I cannot provide a complete functionality statement. However, based on common patterns in algorithmic problems, the function might be expected to return some result based on the manipulation or analysis of the list `a` considering the values of `N` and `K`.

Without more specific information about the intended output, the best I can provide is a general statement about the parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `N`, an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\); `K`, an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N\); and `a`, a list of `N` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(|a_i| \leq 10^9\). The exact return value is not specified, but it is expected to be derived from the manipulation or analysis of the list `a` considering the values of `N` and `K`.**
