Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` with `total[0] = 0`, `total[1] = a[0]` if `a[0] > 0` or `0` if `a[0] <= 0`. If `a[1] > 0`, `total[2] = a[0] + a[1]` if `a[0] > 0` or `total[2] = a[1]` if `a[0] <= 0`. Otherwise, `total[2] = total[1]`. `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` with `asum[1] = a[0]` and `asum[2] = a[0] + a[1]`, `i` is 1.***
