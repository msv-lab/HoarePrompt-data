Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` with `total[0] = 0`, `total[1] = a[0]` if `a[0] > 0` or `0` if `a[0] <= 0`, `total[2]` is the same as before (if `a[1] > 0`, `total[2] = a[0] + a[1]` if `a[0] > 0` or `total[2] = a[1]` if `a[0] <= 0`; otherwise, `total[2] = total[1]`), `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` with `asum[1] = a[0]`, `asum[2] = a[0] + a[1]`, and `asum[3] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`, `i` is 2. If `a[2] > 0`, then `total[3] = total[2] + a[2]`. Otherwise, `total[3] = total[2]`.***
