The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, and `K` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ K ≤ N. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will take the values of `N` and `K` respectively. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies |a_i| ≤ 10^9.**
