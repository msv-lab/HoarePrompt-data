Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `N` and `K` from the input, followed by a list `a` of `N` integers. It calculates the maximum possible sum of a subarray of length `K` in `a`, while also considering the sum of positive integers outside this subarray. The function then prints this maximum sum. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `N`, `K`, and `a` are unchanged, and the result of the computation is printed to the console. If `N < K`, the function will print `0`. **
