The given Python code snippet updates the `asum` list at index `i + 1` by adding the current element `a[i]` to the cumulative sum stored in `asum[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n
- `a` is a list of integers read from input with length `n`
- `total` is a list of length `n + 1` with `total[0] = 0`, `total[1] = a[0]` if `a[0] > 0` or `0` if `a[0] <= 0`. If `a[1] > 0`, `total[2] = a[0] + a[1]` if `a[0] > 0` or `total[2] = a[1]` if `a[0] <= 0`. Otherwise, `total[2] = total[1]`.
- `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` with `asum[1] = a[0]` and `asum[2] = a[0] + a[1]`
- `i` is 2

The code snippet:
```python
asum[i + 1] = asum[i] + a[i]
```

Now, let's calculate the new state:
- `i` is currently 2, so `i + 1` is 3.
- `asum[3]` is updated to `asum[2] + a[2]`.

Since `asum[2] = a[0] + a[1]` and `a[2]` is the third element in the list `a`, the new value of `asum[3]` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` with `total[0] = 0`, `total[1] = a[0]` if `a[0] > 0` or `0` if `a[0] <= 0`. If `a[1] > 0`, `total[2] = a[0] + a[1]` if `a[0] > 0` or `total[2] = a[1]` if `a[0] <= 0`. Otherwise, `total[2] = total[1]`. `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` with `asum[1] = a[0]`, `asum[2] = a[0] + a[1]`, and `asum[3] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`, `i` is 2**.
