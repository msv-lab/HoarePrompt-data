Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` with `asum[1] = a[0]` and all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is less than or equal to 0**
