The value of `asum[1]` is set to `asum[0] + a[0]`. Given that `asum[0]` is initialized to 0, `asum[1]` becomes `a[0]`. The other elements of `asum` and `total` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `i` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` with `asum[1] = a[0]` and all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is 0**
