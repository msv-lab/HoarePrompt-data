To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- `a` is a list of integers read from input with length `n`.
- `total` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized as follows:
  - `total[0] = 0`
  - `total[1] = a[0]` if `a[0] > 0` or `0` if `a[0] <= 0`.
  - `total[2] = a[0] + a[1]` if `a[0] > 0` or `total[2] = a[1]` if `a[0] <= 0`.
  - Otherwise, `total[2] = total[1]`.
- `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized as follows:
  - `asum[1] = a[0]`
  - `asum[2] = a[0] + a[1]`
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the condition `i < n` must still hold true.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- Since the loop is iterating over `xrange(n)`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains the same as it is a fixed integer.
- `k` remains the same as it is a fixed integer.
- `a` remains the same as it is a fixed list.
- `total` remains the same as it is a fixed list.
- `asum` remains the same as it is a fixed list.
- `i` is incremented to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` with `total[0] = 0`, `total[1] = a[0]` if `a[0] > 0` or `0` if `a[0] <= 0`. If `a[1] > 0`, `total[2] = a[0] + a[1]` if `a[0] > 0` or `total[2] = a[1]` if `a[0] <= 0`. Otherwise, `total[2] = total[1]`. `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` with `asum[1] = a[0]` and `asum[2] = a[0] + a[1]`, `i` is 2**.
