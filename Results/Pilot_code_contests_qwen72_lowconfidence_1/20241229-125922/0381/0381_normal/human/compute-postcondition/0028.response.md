The given code updates the value of `ans` by computing the maximum of the current value of `ans` and two new expressions. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. The current value of `ans` is already defined as `max(0, asum[k] + total[n] - total[k], total[n] - total[k])`.
2. The first new expression is `tmp + total[i] + total[n] - total[i + k]`. Given `tmp` is `asum[1 + k] - asum[1]` and `i` is 1, this expression simplifies to `(asum[1 + k] - asum[1]) + total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k]`.
3. The second new expression is `total[i] + total[n] - total[i + k]`. With `i` being 1, this expression simplifies to `total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k]`.

The new value of `ans` is the maximum of these three expressions:
- The original `ans`
- `asum[1 + k] - asum[1] + total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k]`
- `total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k]`

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` where `total[i]` is the sum of all positive integers in `a[:i]` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `asum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `ans` is max(max(0, asum[k] + total[n] - total[k], total[n] - total[k]), (asum[1 + k] - asum[1]) + total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k], total[1] + total[n] - total[1 + k]), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `tmp` is `asum[1 + k] - asum[1]`**
