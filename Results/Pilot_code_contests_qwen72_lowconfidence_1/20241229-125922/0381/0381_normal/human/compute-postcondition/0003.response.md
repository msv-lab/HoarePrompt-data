The code initializes a new list `asum` with a length of `n + 1`, where all elements are set to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, or `total`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0**
