To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for i in xrange(n - k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range of the Loop (`xrange(n - k + 1)`):**
   - The loop will execute if `n - k + 1` is greater than 0.
   - This means `n - k + 1 > 0`.
   - Simplifying this inequality, we get `n > k - 1`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
   - `a` is a list of integers with length `n`.
   - `total` is a list of length `n + 1` where `total[i]` is the sum of all positive integers in `a[:i]` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.
   - `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `asum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.
   - `ans` is 0.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n - k + 1` must be greater than 0.
   - Given the constraints on `n` and `k`, the condition `n > k - 1` must hold true.
   - Since `k` is at least 1, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute at least once.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the initial state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `i` should be 0, and `n` must be at least `k`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` where `total[i]` is the sum of all positive integers in `a[:i]` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `asum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.**
