To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `a` is a list of integers with length `n`.
- `total` is a list of length `n + 1` where `total[i]` is the sum of all positive integers in `a[:i]` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.
- `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `asum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.
- `ans` is max(0, `asum[k] + total[n] - total[k]`, `total[n] - total[k]`).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
- `tmp` is `asum[k]`.

### Loop Condition:
```
for i in xrange(n - k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - k + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
- The loop condition requires `i` to be less than `n - k + 1` for the next iteration to occur.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the increment of `i` and the condition that `n` must still be greater than or equal to `k` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `total` is a list of length `n + 1` where `total[i]` is the sum of all positive integers in `a[:i]` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `asum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `asum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, `ans` is max(0, `asum[k] + total[n] - total[k]`, `total[n] - total[k]`), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `tmp` is `asum[k]`**
