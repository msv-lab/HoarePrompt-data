The code snippet `a = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and assigns the resulting sequence of integers to `a`. This operation changes the value of `a` from a list of integers to a new list of integers derived from the input.

- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- After executing the code, `a` will be a new list of integers read from the input.

The preconditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this code snippet. The new state of `a` is now a list of integers read from the input, which may or may not satisfy the original condition about the range of `a_i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input**.
