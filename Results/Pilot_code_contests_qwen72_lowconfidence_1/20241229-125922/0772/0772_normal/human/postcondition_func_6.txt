The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` and a function `getKey`. It returns a new list that is sorted based on the values returned by the `getKey` function for each element in the original list `l`. The elements in the returned list maintain their relative order as determined by the values of `getKey(element)`. The function does not modify the original list `l`. If `getKey` returns the same value for multiple elements, those elements will appear in the same order in the sorted list as they did in the original list. The function assumes that `getKey` is defined and works correctly for all elements in `l`. If `l` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
