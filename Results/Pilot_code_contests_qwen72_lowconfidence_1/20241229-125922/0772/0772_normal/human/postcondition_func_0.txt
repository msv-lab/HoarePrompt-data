The function `func_1` accepts a variable number of arguments (`args`), a bytes separator (`sep`), a file-like object (`file`), a bytes end-of-line character (`end`), and a boolean flush flag (`flush`). It writes the string representations of the arguments to the specified file, separated by `sep`, and appends `end` at the end. If `flush` is `True`, it flushes the file after writing. The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the `file` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` (if `args` is not empty) separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. If `args` is empty, the `file` remains unchanged except for the addition of `end`. The `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the keys `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'` if they were present.
