The function `func_11` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where both are integers and `y` is non-negative. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the state of the program is such that the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y` is returned, and the internal variables `x` and `y` used within the function no longer affect the external state. If `y` is 0 initially, the function returns `x` without entering the loop, which is consistent with the mathematical definition of GCD (GCD(a, 0) = a).
