The function `func_10` accepts three parameters: `x` (an integer), `y` (a non-negative integer), and `p` (a positive integer). It computes and returns `res`, which is the result of `x` raised to the power of the initial value of `y`, modulo `p`. After the function executes, the final state is as follows: `y` is 0, `res` holds the value `x^initial_y % p`, `p` remains a positive integer, and `x` is the result of repeatedly squaring the initial value of `x` modulo `p` for the number of bits in the initial `y`. Note that there is a minor issue in the code where `p1` is used instead of `p` in the line `x = x * x % p1`, which should be corrected to `x = x * x % p` to match the intended functionality.
