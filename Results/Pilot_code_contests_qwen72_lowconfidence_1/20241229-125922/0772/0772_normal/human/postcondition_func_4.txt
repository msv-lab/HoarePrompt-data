The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of values generated by calling the function `func_4()`. The exact content of the returned list depends on the implementation of `func_4()`, which is not provided. The function assumes that `func_4()` is defined elsewhere and returns an iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, generator). If `func_4()` returns a non-iterable or raises an exception, `func_5` will fail and propagate the exception. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned list, and no other side effects are observed.
