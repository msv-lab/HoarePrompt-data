Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_12` does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether the string `s` can be split into `s` and `s'` (where `s'` is `s` with all 'a' characters removed) is flawed.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Handling Strings with All 'a' Characters**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string `s` consists entirely of 'a' characters. It prints the string and exits the program.

2. **Handling Strings with a Valid Split**:
   - The function attempts to find a prefix `s[:i + 1]` such that appending all non-'a' characters from `s` to this prefix reconstructs `s`.
   - However, the logic for checking this condition is incorrect. The condition `if x + i + 1 == n:` is not a valid way to determine if the prefix and the non-'a' characters can reconstruct the original string `s`.

3. **Handling Strings with No Valid Split**:
   - The function correctly prints `':('` if no valid split is found.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input `s = "ababacacbbcc"`. According to the problem description, the correct output should be `"ababacac"` because:
- `s = "ababacacbbcc"`
- `s' = "bbcc"` (after removing all 'a' characters)
- `t = s + s' = "ababacacbbcc"`

However, the function `func_12` does not correctly identify this valid split. The condition `if x + i + 1 == n:` is not sufficient to check if the prefix and the non-'a' characters can reconstruct the original string `s`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Find the index where the suffix `s'` starts in the string `t`.
2. Check if the prefix of `t` up to this index, when concatenated with the suffix, equals the original string `t`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_12():
    t = func_3()
    n = len(t)
    s_prime = ''.join(c for c in t if c != 'a')
    s_prime_len = len(s_prime)
    
    if s_prime_len == 0:
        func_1(t)
        exit()
    
    for i in range(n - s_prime_len, -1, -1):
        if t[i:i + s_prime_len] == s_prime:
            s = t[:i]
            if s + s_prime == t:
                func_1(s)
                exit()
    
    func_1(':(')
```

This corrected function correctly identifies the valid split and handles all potential cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the original function `func_12` is incorrect.
