You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bob has a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. He defines s' to be the string after removing all "a" characters from s (keeping all other characters in the same order). He then generates a new string t by concatenating s and s'. In other words, t=s+s' (look at notes for an example).

You are given a string t. Your task is to find some s that Bob could have used to generate t. It can be shown that if an answer exists, it will be unique.

Input

The first line of input contains a string t (1 ≤ |t| ≤ 10^5) consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

Print a string s that could have generated t. It can be shown if an answer exists, it is unique. If no string exists, print ":(" (without double quotes, there is no space between the characters).

Examples

Input


aaaaa


Output


aaaaa


Input


aacaababc


Output


:(


Input


ababacacbbcc


Output


ababacac


Input


baba


Output


:(

Note

In the first example, we have s =  "aaaaa", and s' =  "".

In the second example, no such s can work that will generate the given t.

In the third example, we have s =  "ababacac", and s' =  "bbcc", and t = s + s' =  "ababacacbbcc".

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
Input:
aabbcc
```

Expected Output:
```
aabbcc
```

Actual Output:
```
:(
```

The program incorrectly outputs `:(` for this input. According to the problem description, the string `s` should be `aabbcc`, and `s'` would be an empty string since there are no 'a' characters to remove. Therefore, `t` should be `aabbcc + "" = aabbcc`, which matches the input. However, the program incorrectly concludes that no valid `s` exists and prints `:(`. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle cases where the input string `t` does not contain any 'a' characters that need to be removed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 12 : The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters. It generates a string `s` from a previous function call `func_3()`, which is guaranteed to consist of lowercase English letters. The function then processes this string to determine if it meets specific conditions:

1. If the string `s` consists entirely of the character 'a', the function calls `func_1` with the string `s` and exits the program.
2. If the string `s` contains a prefix such that appending all non-'a' characters from `s` to this prefix reconstructs `s`, the function calls `func_1` with this prefix and exits the program.
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, the function calls `func_1` with the string `':('`.

In all cases, the function `func_1` is called exactly once, and the program exits immediately after the call. The final state of the program is that `func_1` has been called with one of the three possible strings: the original string `s` (if all characters are 'a'), a prefix of `s` (if the condition involving non-'a' characters is met), or `':('` (if neither condition is met).+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
