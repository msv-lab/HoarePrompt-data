You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bob has a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. He defines s' to be the string after removing all "a" characters from s (keeping all other characters in the same order). He then generates a new string t by concatenating s and s'. In other words, t=s+s' (look at notes for an example).

You are given a string t. Your task is to find some s that Bob could have used to generate t. It can be shown that if an answer exists, it will be unique.

Input

The first line of input contains a string t (1 ≤ |t| ≤ 10^5) consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

Print a string s that could have generated t. It can be shown if an answer exists, it is unique. If no string exists, print ":(" (without double quotes, there is no space between the characters).

Examples

Input


aaaaa


Output


aaaaa


Input


aacaababc


Output


:(


Input


ababacacbbcc


Output


ababacac


Input


baba


Output


:(

Note

In the first example, we have s =  "aaaaa", and s' =  "".

In the second example, no such s can work that will generate the given t.

In the third example, we have s =  "ababacac", and s' =  "bbcc", and t = s + s' =  "ababacacbbcc".

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
Input:
aabbcc
```

Expected Output:
```
aabbcc
```

Actual Output:
```
:(
```

The program incorrectly outputs `:(` for this input. According to the problem description, the string `s` should be `aabbcc`, and `s'` would be an empty string since there are no 'a' characters to remove. Therefore, `t` should be `aabbcc + "" = aabbcc`, which matches the input. However, the program incorrectly concludes that no valid `s` exists and prints `:(`. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle cases where the input string `t` does not contain any 'a' characters that need to be removed.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

If `args` is not empty, the content of `file` includes the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, with no leading separator. If `args` is empty, `file` remains unchanged.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of values of any type, `sep` is a bytes object representing the separator between arguments, `file` is a file-like object supporting write operations with the content including the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by the value of `end` or `b'\n'`, `end` is a bytes object representing the end-of-line character, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`. If `flush` is `True`, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'flush'` and the file is flushed. If `flush` is `False`, `kwargs` remains unchanged and the file is not flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a variable number of arguments (`args`), a bytes separator (`sep`), a file-like object (`file`), a bytes end-of-line character (`end`), and a boolean flush flag (`flush`). It writes the string representations of the arguments to the specified file, separated by `sep`, and appends `end` at the end. If `flush` is `True`, it flushes the file after writing. The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the `file` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` (if `args` is not empty) separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. If `args` is empty, the `file` remains unchanged except for the addition of `end`. The `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the keys `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'` if they were present.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters, and it returns an integer obtained from user input.
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer obtained from user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer obtained from user input. If the user inputs a non-integer value, a `ValueError` will be raised, and the function will terminate without returning a value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters and returns a string input by the user.
def func_3():
    return str(input())
    #The program returns a string input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns a string input by the user. The function reads a line of input from the user and converts it to a string before returning it. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the user's input as a string. Potential edge cases include the user providing an empty input (which would result in an empty string being returned) or the user interrupting the input process (e.g., using Ctrl+C), which could raise a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters, and it is assumed to be part of a larger program where it reads input from the user or standard input, which is expected to be a string of integers separated by spaces.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `int` function to each element in the list of strings obtained by splitting the input string by spaces. The input is expected to be a string of integers separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a line of input from the user or standard input, which is expected to be a string of integers separated by spaces. It then splits this string into individual substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer using the `int` function, and returns a map object that contains these integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert the substrings to integers. The final state of the program after the function executes is that the map object is returned, and it can be iterated over to access the converted integers.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables used in the function signature. This function does not take any parameters and is likely a part of a larger solution where the necessary data is obtained from other functions or global variables.
def func_5():
    return list(func_4())
    #The program returns a list of values generated by the function `func_4()`. The exact content of the list depends on the implementation of `func_4()`, which is not provided in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of values generated by calling the function `func_4()`. The exact content of the returned list depends on the implementation of `func_4()`, which is not provided. The function assumes that `func_4()` is defined elsewhere and returns an iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, generator). If `func_4()` returns a non-iterable or raises an exception, `func_5` will fail and propagate the exception. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned list, and no other side effects are observed.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple or list where the first element (item[0]) is of any type.
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
    #The program returns the first element of the tuple or list `item`. The type of this element is unspecified as it can be of any type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list. It returns the first element of `item`. The type of the returned element is unspecified as it can be of any type. If `item` is empty or not a tuple/list, the function will raise an error (e.g., `IndexError` for an empty list/tuple or `TypeError` if `item` is not a sequence). After the function executes, the first element of `item` is returned, and no changes are made to `item` itself.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of elements that can be compared and sorted, and getKey is a function that takes an element of l and returns a value used for sorting.
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
    #The program returns a new list that is sorted based on the values returned by the `getKey` function for each element in the original list `l`. The elements in the returned list maintain their relative order as determined by the values of `getKey(element)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` and a function `getKey`. It returns a new list that is sorted based on the values returned by the `getKey` function for each element in the original list `l`. The elements in the returned list maintain their relative order as determined by the values of `getKey(element)`. The function does not modify the original list `l`. If `getKey` returns the same value for multiple elements, those elements will appear in the same order in the sorted list as they did in the original list. The function assumes that `getKey` is defined and works correctly for all elements in `l`. If `l` is empty, the function returns an empty list.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers, and num is a value of any type.
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of lists where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of `num`, and there are `n` such inner lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of `n` inner lists, where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of `num`. The function assumes that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, and `num` can be of any type. If `n` or `m` is 0, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. The function does not modify any of its input parameters and does not have any side effects.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_9(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from the integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from `n`. The function converts the integer `n` into its string representation, then iterates over each character in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and collects these integers into a list. If `n` is 0, the function will return `[0]`. If `n` is negative, the function will return a list of the digits without the negative sign (e.g., `func_9(-123)` will return `[1, 2, 3]). The function does not handle non-integer inputs or floating-point numbers.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer, y is a non-negative integer, and p is a positive integer.
def func_10(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `res` is `x^initial_y % p`, `p` is a positive integer, `x` is the result of repeatedly squaring the initial value of `x` modulo `p` for the number of bits in the initial `y`.
    return res
    #The program returns `res` which is calculated as `x^initial_y % p`, where `x` is the result of repeatedly squaring the initial value of `x` modulo `p` for the number of bits in the initial `y`, `initial_y` is the initial value of `y`, and `p` is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts three parameters: `x` (an integer), `y` (a non-negative integer), and `p` (a positive integer). It computes and returns `res`, which is the result of `x` raised to the power of the initial value of `y`, modulo `p`. After the function executes, the final state is as follows: `y` is 0, `res` holds the value `x^initial_y % p`, `p` remains a positive integer, and `x` is the result of repeatedly squaring the initial value of `x` modulo `p` for the number of bits in the initial `y`. Note that there is a minor issue in the code where `p1` is used instead of `p` in the line `x = x * x % p1`, which should be corrected to `x = x * x % p` to match the intended functionality.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, and y is non-negative.
def func_11(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where both are integers and `y` is non-negative. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the state of the program is such that the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y` is returned, and the internal variables `x` and `y` used within the function no longer affect the external state. If `y` is 0 initially, the function returns `x` without entering the loop, which is consistent with the mathematical definition of GCD (GCD(a, 0) = a).

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, and s is derived from a previous function call `func_3()`.
def func_12():
    s = func_3()
    s = list(s)
    l = []
    n = len(s)
    flag = 0
    a, x = 0, 0
    if (s.count('a') == n) :
        func_1(''.join(s))
        exit()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s`, `l` is an empty list, `flag` is 0, `a` is 0, `x` is 0. If all characters in `s` are 'a', `func_1` has been called with the string `'a' * n` and the program has exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the original values of `s`, `n`, `l`, `flag`, `a`, and `x`.
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] != 'a':
            x += 1
            l.append(s[i])
            if x + i + 1 == n:
                if s[:i + 1] + l == s:
                    func_1(''.join(s[:i + 1]))
                    flag = 1
                    exit()
        else:
            a += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s`. `i` is `len(s) - 1` (the last index of `s`). `l` is a list containing all characters from `s` that are not 'a'. `a` is the number of 'a' characters in `s`. `x` is the number of non-'a' characters in `s`. `flag` is 1 if the loop found a prefix of `s` such that appending the non-'a' characters from `s` to this prefix reconstructs `s`, and the function `func_1` was called with this prefix; otherwise, `flag` remains 0.
    func_1(':(')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters. It generates a string `s` from a previous function call `func_3()`, which is guaranteed to consist of lowercase English letters. The function then processes this string to determine if it meets specific conditions:

1. If the string `s` consists entirely of the character 'a', the function calls `func_1` with the string `s` and exits the program.
2. If the string `s` contains a prefix such that appending all non-'a' characters from `s` to this prefix reconstructs `s`, the function calls `func_1` with this prefix and exits the program.
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, the function calls `func_1` with the string `':('`.

In all cases, the function `func_1` is called exactly once, and the program exits immediately after the call. The final state of the program is that `func_1` has been called with one of the three possible strings: the original string `s` (if all characters are 'a'), a prefix of `s` (if the condition involving non-'a' characters is met), or `':('` (if neither condition is met).
