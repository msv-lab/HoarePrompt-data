Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_12` fails to correctly identify and handle the case where the input string `t` cannot be formed by concatenating `s` and `s'` (where `s'` is `s` with all 'a' characters removed).

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
aacaababc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
:(
```

**Actual Output:**
The program incorrectly outputs a prefix of `s` that does not satisfy the conditions.

**Reason:**
The logic in the for-loop of `func_12` is flawed. It checks if `s[:i + 1] + l == s`, which is incorrect because `s` should be checked against `t` (which is `s + s'`). The correct check should be if `s[:i + 1] + l == t`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
