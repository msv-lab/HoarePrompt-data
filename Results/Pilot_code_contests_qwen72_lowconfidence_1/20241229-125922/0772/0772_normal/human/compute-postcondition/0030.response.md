Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, if the character at index 1 of `s` is not 'a', `l` is a list containing the character at index 1 of `s` twice, `a` is 0, `x` is 2, and if `x + i + 1` is equal to `n`, then if the concatenation of the sublist `s[:i + 1]` and the list `l` is equal to the list `s`, `flag` is 1 and `n` is 2. Otherwise, `flag` is 1. If the character at index 1 of `s` is 'a', `l` is a list containing 'a', `a` is 1, `x` is 2, and `flag` is 1. If the concatenation of the sublist `s[:i + 1]` and the list `l` is not equal to the list `s`, `flag` remains 0.***
