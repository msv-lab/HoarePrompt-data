The function call `func_1(''.join(s[:i + 1]))` involves joining the first `i + 1` characters of the list `s` into a single string and passing this string to the function `func_1`. However, since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact behavior or what it returns. Assuming `func_1` does not modify global variables or have side effects (such as modifying `s`, `n`, `i`, `l`, `a`, `x`, or `flag`), the only effect of this line is the potential return of a value from `func_1`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter.
- `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If the character at index 1 of `s` is not 'a', `l` is a list containing the character at index 1 of `s` twice.
- `a` is 0.
- `x` is 2.
- If `x + i + 1` is equal to `n`, then if the concatenation of the sublist `s[:i + 1]` and the list `l` is equal to the list `s`, `flag` is 1 and `n` is 2. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0.
- If the character at index 1 of `s` is 'a', `l` is a list containing 'a', `a` is 1, `x` is 2, and `flag` is 0.

Since `func_1` is called with the string `''.join(s[:i + 1])`, which is the concatenation of the first two characters of `s`, and assuming `func_1` does not have side effects, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, if the character at index 1 of `s` is not 'a', `l` is a list containing the character at index 1 of `s` twice, `a` is 0, `x` is 2, and if `x + i + 1` is equal to `n`, then if the concatenation of the sublist `s[:i + 1]` and the list `l` is equal to the list `s`, `flag` is 1 and `n` is 2. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0. If the character at index 1 of `s` is 'a', `l` is a list containing 'a', `a` is 1, `x` is 2, and `flag` is 0.**
