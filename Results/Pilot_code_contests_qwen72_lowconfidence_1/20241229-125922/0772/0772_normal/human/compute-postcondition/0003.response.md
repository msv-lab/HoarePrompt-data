`n` is assigned the length of the list `s`. Since `s` is a list of characters obtained from converting the string returned by `func_3()`, the value of `n` is the number of characters in this list. The variable `l` remains an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s`, and `l` is an empty list.
Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s`, and `l` is an empty list.**
