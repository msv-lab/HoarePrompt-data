Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list containing the first character of `s` which is not 'a', `flag` is 0 or 1, `a` is 0, `x` is 1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not 'a'. Additionally, the current value of `x + i + 1` is equal to `n`. If the concatenation of the sublist `s[:i + 1]` and the list `l` is equal to the list `s`, then `flag` is 1 and `n` is 2. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0.***
