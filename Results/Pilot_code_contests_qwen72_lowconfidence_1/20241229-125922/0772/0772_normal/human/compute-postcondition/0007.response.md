To address this, let's consider the function call `func_1(''.join(s))`. This function call converts the list `s` into a single string by joining its elements and passes this string to the function `func_1`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter.
- `n` is the number of characters in `s`.
- `l` is an empty list.
- `flag` is 0.
- `a` is 0.
- `x` is 0.
- All characters in `s` are 'a'.

The code snippet `func_1(''.join(s))` does the following:
- `''.join(s)` creates a string where all characters in `s` are concatenated together. Since all characters in `s` are 'a', the resulting string will be a string of 'a' repeated `n` times.
- This string is then passed to the function `func_1`.

However, the definition of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine what changes it makes to the variables or what it returns. Without this information, we can only state that the function `func_1` has been called with a string of 'a' repeated `n` times.

Since no other changes are specified, the output state remains the same for all variables except for the fact that `func_1` has been called with the string `'a' * n`.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, each character being 'a', `n` is the number of characters in `s`, `l` is an empty list, `flag` is 0, `a` is 0, `x` is 0, `func_1` has been called with the string `'a' * n`.**
