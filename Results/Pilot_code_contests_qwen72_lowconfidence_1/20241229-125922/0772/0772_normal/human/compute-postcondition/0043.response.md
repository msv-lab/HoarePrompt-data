Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If the character at index 2 of `s` is not 'a': `l` is a list containing the character at index 2 of `s`, `a` is 0, `x` is 1. If `x + i + 1` equals `n` and the concatenation of the sublist `s[:i + 1]` and the list `l` is equal to the list `s`, then `flag` is 1, `n` is 2, and `func_1(''.join(s[:i + 1]))` has been called. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0. If the character at index 2 of `s` is 'a': `l` is an empty list, `a` is 1, `x` is 0, and `flag` is 0.***
