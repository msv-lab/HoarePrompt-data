The `exit()` function call causes the program to terminate immediately. No further code execution occurs after this point, and no changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, if the character at index 1 of `s` is not 'a', `l` is a list containing the character at index 1 of `s` twice, `a` is 0, `x` is 2, and if `x + i + 1` is equal to `n`, then if the concatenation of the sublist `s[:i + 1]` and the list `l` is equal to the list `s`, `flag` is 1 and `n` is 2. Otherwise, `flag` is 1. If the character at index 1 of `s` is 'a', `l` is a list containing 'a', `a` is 1, `x` is 2, and `flag` is 1.**
