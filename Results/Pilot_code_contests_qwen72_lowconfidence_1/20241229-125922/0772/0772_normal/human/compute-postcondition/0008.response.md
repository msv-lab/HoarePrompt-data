The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. No further code is executed after this point, and no changes are made to the variables.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, each character being 'a', `n` is the number of characters in `s`, `l` is an empty list, `flag` is 0, `a` is 0, `x` is 0, `func_1` has been called with the string `'a' * n`. The program has exited.**
