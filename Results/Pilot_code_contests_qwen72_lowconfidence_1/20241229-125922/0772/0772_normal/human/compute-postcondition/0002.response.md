The code initializes an empty list `l`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a list of characters, each being a lowercase English letter, and `s` is the result of converting the string returned by `func_3()` into a list. The initialization of `l` does not affect the value of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, and `s` is the result of converting the string returned by `func_3()` into a list, `l` is an empty list**
