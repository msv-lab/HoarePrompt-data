The provided code snippet calls the function `func_1` with the argument `':('`. However, the initial state does not specify what `func_1` does, nor does it provide any information about what `func_1` might return or modify. Since there's no additional context about the behavior of `func_1`, we cannot infer changes to the state based on this call alone.

Therefore, the only change that can be definitively stated is that `func_1` has been called with the argument `':('`.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s`, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `l` is a list containing all characters from `s` that are not 'a', `a` is the number of 'a' characters in `s`, `x` is the number of non-'a' characters in `s`, `flag` is 1 if the loop found a prefix of `s` such that appending the non-'a' characters from `s` to this prefix reconstructs `s`, and the function `func_1` was called with this prefix; otherwise, `flag` remains 0. `func_1(':(')` has been called.**
