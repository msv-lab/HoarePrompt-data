Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list containing the first character of `s` which is not 'a', `a` is 0, `x` is 1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not 'a'. If `x + i + 1` is equal to `n`, then if the concatenation of the sublist `s[:i + 1]` and the list `l` is equal to the list `s`, `flag` is 1 and `n` is 2. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0.***
