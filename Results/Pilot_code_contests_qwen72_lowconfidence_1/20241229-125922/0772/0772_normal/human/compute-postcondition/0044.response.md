Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s`. `i` is `len(s) - 1` (the last index of `s`). `l` is a list containing all characters from `s` that are not 'a'. `a` is the number of 'a' characters in `s`. `x` is the number of non-'a' characters in `s`. `flag` is 1 if the loop found a prefix of `s` such that appending the non-'a' characters from `s` to this prefix reconstructs `s`, and the function `func_1` was called with this prefix; otherwise, `flag` remains 0.**
