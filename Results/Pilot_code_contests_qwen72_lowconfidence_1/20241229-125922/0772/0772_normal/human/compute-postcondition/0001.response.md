The code `s = list(s)` converts the string `s` into a list of its characters. Since `s` was initially a string consisting of lowercase English letters and was the result of the function call `func_3()`, after this operation, `s` will be a list where each element is a character from the original string.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, and `s` is the result of converting the string returned by `func_3()` into a list.**
