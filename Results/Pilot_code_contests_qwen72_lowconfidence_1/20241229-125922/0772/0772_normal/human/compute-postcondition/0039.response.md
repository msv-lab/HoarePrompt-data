The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. This means no further code execution occurs after this point, and the program does not continue to evaluate any subsequent statements or conditions.

Given the initial state and the execution of `exit()`, the program stops, and no changes are made to the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the character at index 2 of `s` twice, `a` is 0, `x` is 2, if `x + i + 1` is equal to `n`, then if the concatenation of the sublist `s[:i + 1]` and the list `l` is equal to the list `s`, `flag` is 1 and `n` is 2, otherwise `flag` is 1. `func_1(''.join(s[:i + 1]))` has been called.**
