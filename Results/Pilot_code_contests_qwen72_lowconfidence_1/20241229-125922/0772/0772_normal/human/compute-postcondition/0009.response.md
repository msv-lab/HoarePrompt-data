Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is the number of characters in `s`, `l` is an empty list, `flag` is 0, `a` is 0, `x` is 0. If all characters in `s` are 'a', `func_1` has been called with the string `'a' * n` and the program has exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the original values of `s`, `n`, `l`, `flag`, `a`, and `x`.***
