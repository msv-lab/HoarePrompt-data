The function `func_1` is called with the argument `'' . join(s[:i + 1])`, which is a string formed by joining the elements of the sublist `s[:i + 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter.
- `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `l` is a list containing the first character of `s` which is not 'a'.
- `flag` is 0.
- `a` is 0.
- `x` is 1.
- `i` is 0.
- The character at index `i` of `s` is not 'a'.
- The current value of `x + i + 1` is equal to `n`.
- The concatenation of the sublist `s[:i + 1]` and the list `l` is equal to the list `s`.

From the given conditions, we can infer:
- Since `i` is 0 and the character at index `i` of `s` is not 'a', the first character of `s` is not 'a'.
- Since `x + i + 1` is equal to `n`, and `x` is 1 and `i` is 0, `n` is 2.
- Therefore, `s` contains exactly two characters, and the first character is not 'a'.
- The list `l` contains the first character of `s` which is not 'a', so `l` is equivalent to `[s[0]]`.
- The concatenation of `s[:i + 1]` (which is `[s[0]]`) and `l` (which is also `[s[0]]`) is `s`, which means `s` is `[s[0], s[0]]`.

The function `func_1` is called with the argument `''.join(s[:i + 1])`, which is the string representation of the first character of `s`.

Since the problem does not specify what `func_1` does, we cannot determine the exact impact on the program state. However, since no changes to the variables are specified, we assume that the function does not modify any of the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is 2, `l` is a list containing the first character of `s` which is not 'a', `flag` is 0, `a` is 0, `x` is 1, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is not 'a', the current value of `x + i + 1` is equal to `n`, the concatenation of the sublist `s[:i + 1]` and the list `l` is equal to the list `s`.**
