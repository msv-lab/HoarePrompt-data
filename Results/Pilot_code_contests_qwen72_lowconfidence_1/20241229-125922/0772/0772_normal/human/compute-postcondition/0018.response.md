The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. This means that no further code will be executed, and the program will end. As a result, the state of the variables remains unchanged from their initial state before the `exit()` call.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, each character being a lowercase English letter, `n` is 2, `l` is a list containing the first character of `s` which is not 'a', `flag` is 1, `a` is 0, `x` is 1, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is not 'a', the current value of `x + i + 1` is equal to `n`, the concatenation of the sublist `s[:i + 1]` and the list `l` is equal to the list `s`.**
