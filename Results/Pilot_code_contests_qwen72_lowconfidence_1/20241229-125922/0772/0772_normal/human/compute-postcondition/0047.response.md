Functionality: ** The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters. It generates a string `s` from a previous function call `func_3()`, which is guaranteed to consist of lowercase English letters. The function then processes this string to determine if it meets specific conditions:

1. If the string `s` consists entirely of the character 'a', the function calls `func_1` with the string `s` and exits the program.
2. If the string `s` contains a prefix such that appending all non-'a' characters from `s` to this prefix reconstructs `s`, the function calls `func_1` with this prefix and exits the program.
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, the function calls `func_1` with the string `':('`.

In all cases, the function `func_1` is called exactly once, and the program exits immediately after the call. The final state of the program is that `func_1` has been called with one of the three possible strings: the original string `s` (if all characters are 'a'), a prefix of `s` (if the condition involving non-'a' characters is met), or `':('` (if neither condition is met). **
