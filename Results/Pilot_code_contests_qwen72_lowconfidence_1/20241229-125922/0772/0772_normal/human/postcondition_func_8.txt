The function `func_9` accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from `n`. The function converts the integer `n` into its string representation, then iterates over each character in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and collects these integers into a list. If `n` is 0, the function will return `[0]`. If `n` is negative, the function will return a list of the digits without the negative sign (e.g., `func_9(-123)` will return `[1, 2, 3]). The function does not handle non-integer inputs or floating-point numbers.
