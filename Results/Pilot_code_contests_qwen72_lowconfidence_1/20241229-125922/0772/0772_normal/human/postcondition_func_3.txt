The function `func_4` reads a line of input from the user or standard input, which is expected to be a string of integers separated by spaces. It then splits this string into individual substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer using the `int` function, and returns a map object that contains these integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert the substrings to integers. The final state of the program after the function executes is that the map object is returned, and it can be iterated over to access the converted integers.
