The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns a string input by the user. The function reads a line of input from the user and converts it to a string before returning it. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the user's input as a string. Potential edge cases include the user providing an empty input (which would result in an empty string being returned) or the user interrupting the input process (e.g., using Ctrl+C), which could raise a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception.
