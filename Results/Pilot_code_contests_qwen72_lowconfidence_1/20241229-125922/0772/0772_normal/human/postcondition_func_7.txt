The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of `n` inner lists, where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of `num`. The function assumes that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, and `num` can be of any type. If `n` or `m` is 0, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. The function does not modify any of its input parameters and does not have any side effects.
