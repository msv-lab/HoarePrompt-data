You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: We have N integers. The i-th integer is A_i.

Find \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} (A_i \mbox{ XOR } A_j), modulo (10^9+7).

What is \mbox{ XOR }?

The XOR of integers A and B, A \mbox{ XOR } B, is defined as follows:

* When A \mbox{ XOR } B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k \geq 0) is 1 if either A or B, but not both, has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 otherwise.

For example, 3 \mbox{ XOR } 5 = 6. (In base two: 011 \mbox{ XOR } 101 = 110.)

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 3 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Print the value \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} (A_i \mbox{ XOR } A_j), modulo (10^9+7).
