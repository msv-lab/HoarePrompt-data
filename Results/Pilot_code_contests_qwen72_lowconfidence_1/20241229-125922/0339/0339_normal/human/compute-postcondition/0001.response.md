The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into parts, converting each part into an integer and storing them in the list `A_l`. The initial state specifies that `N` is an input integer within the range 2 to 3 * 10^5, and `A_l` is supposed to be a list of `N` integers, each satisfying 0 <= A_i < 2^60.

After executing the code snippet, `A_l` is updated to contain the integers from the input. The length of `A_l` will be `N`, and each element `A_i` in `A_l` will satisfy the condition 0 <= A_i < 2^60, as per the initial state constraints.

Therefore, the Output State is: **N is an input integer such that 2 <= N <= 3 * 10^5, and `A_l` is a list of N integers where each element `A_i` satisfies 0 <= `A_i` < 2^60, `A_l` is updated to the list of integers from input.**
