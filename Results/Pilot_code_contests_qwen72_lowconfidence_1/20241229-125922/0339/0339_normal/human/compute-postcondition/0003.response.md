The function `func_2` does not explicitly show parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts two parameters: `N` and `A_l`. `N` is an integer with the constraint 2 <= N <= 3 * 10^5, and `A_l` is a list of `N` integers where each element `A_i` satisfies 0 <= A_i < 2^60.

However, since the output or return value of the function is not specified in the provided context, I cannot accurately describe what the function returns. For the purpose of this exercise, I will assume that the function processes the list `A_l` in some way and returns a result based on the elements of `A_l`.

Given the lack of specific output details, the functionality can only be described up to the point of understanding the input parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `N`, an integer such that 2 <= N <= 3 * 10^5, and `A_l`, a list of `N` integers where each element `A_i` satisfies 0 <= A_i < 2^60. The function processes the list `A_l` and returns a result based on the elements of `A_l`.** 

If more specific output details were provided, the functionality description could be more precise.
