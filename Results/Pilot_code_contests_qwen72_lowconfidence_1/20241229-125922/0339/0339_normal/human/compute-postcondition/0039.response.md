Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `num` is the third element in `arr`, `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the third element in `arr` (non-empty and must have at least 3 characters), `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`, `i` is 2, and `s` is the third character of `b`. If `s` is '1', `bitcount[2]` is incremented by 1.***
