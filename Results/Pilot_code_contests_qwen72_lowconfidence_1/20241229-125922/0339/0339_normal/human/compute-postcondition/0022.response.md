The code snippet `bitcount[i] += int(s)` impacts the variable `bitcount` at the index `i`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the current index in the string `b`, which is the reversed binary string representation of the second element in `arr`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, it indicates the position of the next character to be processed.

2. **Variable `s`**: This is the next character in the string `b`. The value of `s` is checked to see if it is not '0'. If `s` is '1', then the corresponding index in `bitcount` is incremented by 1.

3. **Variable `bitcount`**: This is a list where the value at index `i` is updated based on the value of `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\)
- `sum` is 0
- `num` is the second element in `arr`
- `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the second element in `arr`, and `b` is non-empty
- `i` is the next character in the string `b`, and `i` is incremented by 1
- If the next character `s` in the string `b` is not '0', the element at the corresponding index in `bitcount` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bitcount` remains unchanged.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `bitcount[i]` is incremented by 1 if `s` is '1'.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, indicating the next character to be processed in `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `num` is the second element in `arr`, `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the second element in `arr`, and `b` is non-empty, `i` is incremented by 1, if the next character `s` in the string `b` is '1', then `bitcount[i]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `bitcount` remains unchanged.**
