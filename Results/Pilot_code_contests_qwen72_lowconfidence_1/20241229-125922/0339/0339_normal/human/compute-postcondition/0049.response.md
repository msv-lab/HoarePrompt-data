Output State: **The program returns the value of `sum % (10 ** 9 + 7)` where `sum` is the sum of \( b_i \times (n - b_i) \times 2^i \) for all \( i \) from 0 to 99, and \( b_i \) is the \( i \)-th element in `bitcount`. Here, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`, and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).**
