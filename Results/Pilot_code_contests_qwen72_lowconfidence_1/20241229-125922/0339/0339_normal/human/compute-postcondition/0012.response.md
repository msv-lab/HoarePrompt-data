The code snippet updates the `bitcount` list by adding the integer value of `s` to the `bitcount` at index `i`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\)
- `sum` is 0
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros except `bitcount[0]` is 1 if the first character in `b` is '1' and `bitcount[1]` is set to `int(s)` if `i` is not '0'
- `num` is the first element in `arr`
- `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`
- `i` is 2
- `s` is the third character in `b`

The code `bitcount[i] += int(s)` will increment the value at `bitcount[2]` by the integer value of `s`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\)
- `sum` is 0
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros except `bitcount[0]` is 1 if the first character in `b` is '1', `bitcount[1]` is set to `int(s)` if `i` is not '0', and `bitcount[2]` is now `bitcount[2] + int(s)`
- `num` is the first element in `arr`
- `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`
- `i` is 2
- `s` is the third character in `b`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros except `bitcount[0]` is 1 if the first character in `b` is '1', `bitcount[1]` is set to `int(s)` if `i` is not '0', and `bitcount[2]` is now `bitcount[2] + int(s)`, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`, `i` is 2, `s` is the third character in `b`**
