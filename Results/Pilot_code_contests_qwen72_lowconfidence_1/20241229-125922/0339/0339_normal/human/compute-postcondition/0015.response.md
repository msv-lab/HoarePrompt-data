To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
- `sum` is 0.
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`.
- `num` is the first element in `arr`.
- `b` is a reversed binary string representation of `num`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for num in arr:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `arr` to iterate over.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is the total number of elements in `arr`.
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `sum` is 0.
   - `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements.
   - `num` is the first element in `arr`.
   - `b` is a reversed binary string representation of `num`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **`num`**: In the next iteration, `num` will be the second element in `arr`.
- **`b`**: `b` will be the reversed binary string representation of the new `num`.
- **`sum`**: Since the loop body is omitted, we assume `sum` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified in the loop body.
- **`bitcount`**: Similarly, `bitcount` will remain unchanged unless modified in the loop body.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `num` should be the second element in `arr`.
- `b` should be the reversed binary string representation of the new `num`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`, `num` is the second element in `arr`, `b` is a reversed binary string representation of the second element in `arr`.**
