To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for (i, b) in enumerate(bitcount):`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the `bitcount` list, with `i` being the index and `b` being the value at that index.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
   - `sum` is `b * (n - b)`.
   - `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` is the first element in `bitcount`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next iteration should increment `i` by 1 and set `b` to the next element in `bitcount`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - The next value of `b` will be the second element in `bitcount`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `b` will be set to the second element in `bitcount`.
   - `sum` will be recalculated based on the new value of `b` and the current value of `n`.

Given this analysis, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is the second element in `bitcount` * (n - second element in `bitcount`), `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`, `i` is 1, `b` is the second element in `bitcount`**
