The code snippet `b = reversed(bin(num)[2:])` changes the value of `b`. Here's the detailed breakdown:

- `bin(num)` converts the integer `num` (which is the third element in `arr`) to its binary string representation, prefixed with '0b'.
- `[2:]` removes the '0b' prefix from the binary string.
- `reversed(...)` reverses the resulting binary string.

Therefore, `b` is now the reversed binary string representation of `num`.

All other variables (`n`, `arr`, `sum`, `num`, and `bitcount`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `num` is the third element in `arr`, `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the third element in `arr`, and `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`.**
