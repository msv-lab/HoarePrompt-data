To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
   - `sum` is 0.
   - `num` is the second element in `arr`.
   - `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the second element in `arr`, and `b` is non-empty.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - If the next character `s` in the string `b` is '1', then `bitcount[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bitcount` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (i, s) in enumerate(b):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the characters in the string `b` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the character `s`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so the next iteration will use `i + 1`.
   - The next character `s` in the string `b` needs to be considered.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The next character `s` in the string `b` is the character at position `i + 1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The next character `s` in the string `b` is the character at position `i + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `num` is the second element in `arr`, `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the second element in `arr`, and `b` is non-empty. `i` is incremented by 1, and `s` is the next character in the string `b` at position `i + 1`.**
