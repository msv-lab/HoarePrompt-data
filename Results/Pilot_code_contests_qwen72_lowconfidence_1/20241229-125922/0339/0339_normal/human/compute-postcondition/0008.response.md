To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5 \).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \( 0 \leq A_i < 2^{60} \).
- `sum` is 0.
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros except `bitcount[0]` is 1 if `s` is '1', otherwise `bitcount` remains a list of 100 zeros.
- `num` is the first element in `arr`.
- `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is the first character in `b`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (i, s) in enumerate(b):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the characters in the string `b` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the character `s`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is the first character in `b`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must have at least one more character beyond the first character.
   - Therefore, `b` must have at least 2 characters.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `s` will be the second character in `b`.

### Conclusion:
The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `s` should be the second character in `b`.

Thus, the updated state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 0 ≤ A_i < 2^60, `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros except `bitcount[0]` is 1 if the first character in `b` is '1', otherwise `bitcount` remains a list of 100 zeros, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`, `i` is 1, and `s` is the second character in `b`.**
