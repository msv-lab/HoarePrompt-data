Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 0 ≤ A_i < 2^60, `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros except `bitcount[0]` is 1 if the first character in `b` is '1'. If `i` is not '0', `bitcount[1]` is set to `int(s)`. `num` is the first element in `arr`, `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`, `i` is 1, and `s` is the second character in `b`.***
