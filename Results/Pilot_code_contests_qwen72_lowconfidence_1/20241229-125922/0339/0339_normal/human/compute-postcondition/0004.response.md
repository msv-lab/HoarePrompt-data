Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list `A_l` of `N` integers from the standard input. It then calls another function `func_1` with `N` and `A_l` as arguments and prints the result returned by `func_1`. The function does not return any value itself, but its primary purpose is to process the input list `A_l` through `func_1` and output the result. The state of the program after `func_2` concludes is that `N` and `A_l` have been read and processed, and the result of `func_1` has been printed to the standard output. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input values do not meet the constraints (e.g., `N` is outside the range 2 to 3 * 10^5, or any `A_i` is outside the range 0 to 2^60 - 1), the behavior of `func_2` is undefined, and it may raise exceptions or produce incorrect results.
- The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not handle invalid input gracefully. For example, if the number of integers provided in the second input line does not match `N`, the function will raise an error.
- The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, so the specific processing and output depend on the implementation of `func_1`.
