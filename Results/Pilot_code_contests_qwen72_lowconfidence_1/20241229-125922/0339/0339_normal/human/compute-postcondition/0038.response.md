The code snippet `bitcount[i] += int(s)` updates the value of `bitcount[i]` by adding the integer value of `s`. Given that `i` is 2 and `s` is the third character of the binary string `b`, which represents the binary form of `num`, the value of `bitcount[2]` will be incremented by 1 if `s` is '1'. If `s` is '0', `bitcount[2]` remains unchanged.

Since the initial state specifies that `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements, and `i` is 2, the only change in the state is the potential increment of `bitcount[2]` by 1 if `s` is '1'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `num` is the third element in `arr`, `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the third element in `arr` (non-empty and must have at least 3 characters), `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`, `i` is 2, `s` is the third character of `b`. If `s` is '1', `bitcount[2]` is incremented by 1.**
