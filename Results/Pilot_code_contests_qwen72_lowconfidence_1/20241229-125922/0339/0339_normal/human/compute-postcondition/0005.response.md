Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 0 ≤ A_i < 2^60, `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`, `i` is 0, `s` is the first character in `b`. The current value of `s` is not '0'.***
