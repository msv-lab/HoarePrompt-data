Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `num` is the second element in `arr`, `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the second element in `arr`, and `b` is non-empty. If the current character `i` in the string `b` is not '0', the element at the corresponding index in `bitcount` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bitcount` remains unchanged.***
