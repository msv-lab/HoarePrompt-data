The value of `sum` is updated by adding the product of `b * (n - b) * 2 ** i`. The value of `b` is the first element in `bitcount`, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `i` is 0. The calculation `2 ** i` results in 1 because `i` is 0.

Therefore, the new value of `sum` is `sum + b * (n - b) * 1`, which simplifies to `sum + b * (n - b)`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state includes the updated value of `sum` and the unchanged values of `n`, `arr`, `bitcount`, `i`, and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is `b * (n - b)`, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`, `i` is 0, `b` is the first element in `bitcount`**.
