The code snippet updates the `bitcount` list by incrementing the value at index `i` by the integer value of `s`. Let's analyze this step by step:

1. **Initial State Review**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
   - `sum` is 0.
   - `num` is the third element in `arr`.
   - `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the third element in `arr` (non-empty).
   - `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the second character of `b`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `bitcount[i] += int(s)` increments the value at index `i` of `bitcount` by the integer value of `s`.

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the second character of `b`.
   - If `s` is '1', `int(s)` will be 1, and `bitcount[1]` will be incremented by 1.
   - If `s` is '0', `int(s)` will be 0, and `bitcount[1]` will remain unchanged.

4. **Output State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
   - `sum` is 0.
   - `num` is the third element in `arr`.
   - `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the third element in `arr` (non-empty).
   - `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the second character of `b`.
   - If `s` is '1', `bitcount[1]` is incremented by 1. If `s` is '0', `bitcount[1]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `num` is the third element in `arr`, `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the third element in `arr` (non-empty), `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`, `i` is 1, `s` is the second character of `b`, and if `s` is '1', `bitcount[1]` is incremented by 1.**
