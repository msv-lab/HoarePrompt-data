To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
- `sum` is 0.
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros except:
  - `bitcount[0]` is 1 if the first character in `b` is '1'.
  - If `i` is not '0', `bitcount[1]` is set to `int(s)`.
- `num` is the first element in `arr`.
- `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is the second character in `b`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (i, s) in enumerate(b):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the characters in the string `b` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the character `s` at each iteration.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `s` is the second character in `b`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `s` must be the third character in `b`.

### Adjustments:
- **Index `i`**: Increment `i` from 1 to 2.
- **Character `s`**: `s` should now be the third character in `b`.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains the same: \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` remains the same: a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
- `sum` remains the same: 0.
- `bitcount` remains the same: a list of 100 zeros except `bitcount[0]` is 1 if the first character in `b` is '1', and `bitcount[1]` is set to `int(s)` if `i` is not '0'.
- `num` remains the same: the first element in `arr`.
- `b` remains the same: a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`.
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is the third character in `b`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros except `bitcount[0]` is 1 if the first character in `b` is '1' and `bitcount[1]` is set to `int(s)` if `i` is not '0', `num` is the first element in `arr`, `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`, `i` is 2, and `s` is the third character in `b`.**
