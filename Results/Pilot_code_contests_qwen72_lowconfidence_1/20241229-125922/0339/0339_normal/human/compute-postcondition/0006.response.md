The code snippet `bitcount[i] += int(s)` increments the value at index `i` in the list `bitcount` by the integer value of `s`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, and `s` is the first character in the reversed binary string `b` of `num`, which is not '0'. Therefore, `s` must be '1'. The value of `bitcount[0]` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 0 ≤ A_i < 2^60, `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros except `bitcount[0]` is 1, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`, `i` is 0, `s` is the first character in `b` and `s` is '1'.**
