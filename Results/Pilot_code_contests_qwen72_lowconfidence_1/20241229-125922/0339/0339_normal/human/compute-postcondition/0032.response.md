The code snippet `bitcount[i] += int(s)` updates the `bitcount` list by incrementing the value at index `i` by the integer value of `s`. Given that `i` is 0 and `s` is the first character of `b` (which is not '0'), `s` must be '1'. Therefore, `bitcount[0]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `num` is the third element in `arr`, `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the third element in `arr` (non-empty), `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`, `i` is 0, `s` is '1', `bitcount[0]` is incremented by 1**.
