The code `b = reversed(bin(num)[2:])` reverses the binary string representation of `num`, excluding the '0b' prefix. Here's the step-by-step impact on the program:

1. `bin(num)` converts `num` (the second element in `arr`) to its binary string representation, prefixed with '0b'.
2. `[2:]` removes the '0b' prefix from the binary string.
3. `reversed(...)` reverses the resulting binary string.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\)
- `sum` is 0
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`
- `num` is the second element in `arr`
- `b` is a reversed binary string representation of the second element in `arr`

After executing the code, the only change is in the value of `b`. The new value of `b` is the reversed binary string of `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`, `num` is the second element in `arr`, `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the second element in `arr`**
