To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the effect of the loop after all iterations have completed. The loop iterates over the `bitcount` list, which has 100 elements. Each iteration updates the `sum` variable based on the current bit count and the position of the bit.

Let's break down the loop and its effects:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
   - `sum` is initially 0.
   - `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` (from 0 to 99):
     - `b` is the value at index `i` in `bitcount`.
     - `sum` is updated by adding \( b \times (n - b) \times 2^i \).

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `sum` will have accumulated the value of the expression \( b \times (n - b) \times 2^i \) for all \( i \) from 0 to 99.
   - The values of `n`, `arr`, and `bitcount` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Given this, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is the sum of \( b_i \times (n - b_i) \times 2^i \) for all \( i \) from 0 to 99, where \( b_i \) is the \( i \)-th element in `bitcount`, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`.**
