Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `num` is the second element in `arr`, `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the second element in `arr`, `i` is 1, and `s` is the character at position 2 in `b`. If `i` is not '0', `bitcount[1]` is incremented by the integer value of `s`. Otherwise, there is no change to `bitcount[1]`.***
