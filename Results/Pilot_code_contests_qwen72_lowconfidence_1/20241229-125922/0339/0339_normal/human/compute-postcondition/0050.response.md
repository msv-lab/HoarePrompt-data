The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `arr`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 0 ≤ A_i < 2^60. After executing the function body, the function returns the value of `sum % (10`.

However, the output description seems incomplete. Assuming the intended output is `sum % (10^9 + 7)`, which is a common practice in programming contests for large numbers to prevent overflow:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, and returns the value of the sum of elements in `arr` modulo 10^9 + 7.**
