The code snippet updates the value of `sum` by adding the product of `b`, `(n - b)`, and `2 ** i` to its current value. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `sum` is updated to `sum + b * (n - b) * 2 ** i`.
- `b` is the second element in `bitcount`, which is a fixed value and does not change.
- `n` is a fixed value and does not change.
- `i` is 1, and this value is used in the calculation of `2 ** i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
- `sum` is initially the second element in `bitcount` * (n - second element in `bitcount`).
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`.
- `i` is 1.
- `b` is the second element in `bitcount`.

After executing the code:
- `sum` is updated to `sum + b * (n - b) * 2 ** 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `arr`, `bitcount`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is the second element in `bitcount` * (n - second element in `bitcount`) + b * (n - b) * 2, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`, `i` is 1, `b` is the second element in `bitcount`.**
