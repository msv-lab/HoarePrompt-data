To determine the final state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to consider the initial conditions and how the loop modifies the variables over time. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step analysis:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
- `sum` is 0.
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros.
- `num` is the first element in `arr`.
- `b` is a reversed binary string representation of `num`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i, s in enumerate(b):
    if i != '0':
        bitcount[i] += int(s)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the characters in the reversed binary string `b`.
   - For each character `s` at index `i` in `b`, if `i` is not '0' (which is always true since `i` is an integer index), `bitcount[i]` is incremented by `int(s)`.

2. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - `bitcount[i]` will be incremented by the value of the corresponding bit in `b` (which is either 0 or 1).
   - The loop will run for each bit in the binary representation of `num`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `bitcount` will reflect the count of 1s in each bit position of the binary representation of `num`.
   - The length of `b` (the reversed binary string of `num`) determines how many times the loop runs.
   - Since `b` is a reversed binary string, the most significant bit (MSB) will be at the last index of `b`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
- `sum` remains 0.
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`.
- `num` is the first element in `arr`.
- `b` is a reversed binary string representation of `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `b` is a reversed binary string representation of `num`.**
