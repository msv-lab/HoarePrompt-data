The code snippet provided calls the function `func_1` with arguments `N` and `A_l`. Since the specifics of `func_1` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact return value or any side effects of this function call. However, we can infer that the function `func_1` is expected to process the list `A_l` and possibly return a value or modify `A_l` in some way.

Given that the function call `func_1(N, A_l)` is executed, and assuming it returns a value (since `print` is used), the output of the function will be printed to the console. The impact on the state of the program is that the function `func_1` is called with `N` and `A_l` as arguments, and the result of the function is printed.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot specify what the function does to `A_l` or what it returns. However, the variables `N` and `A_l` remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and constraints.

Therefore, the Output State is: **N is an input integer such that 2 <= N <= 3 * 10^5, `A_l` is a list of N integers where each element `A_i` satisfies 0 <= `A_i` < 2^60, and the result of `func_1(N, A_l)` is printed.**
