Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros except `bitcount[0]` is 1 if the first character in `b` is '1'. If `i` is not '0', `bitcount[1]` is set to `int(s)` and `bitcount[2]` is incremented by `int(s)`. `num` is the first element in `arr`, `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`, `i` is 2, and `s` is the third character in `b`.***
