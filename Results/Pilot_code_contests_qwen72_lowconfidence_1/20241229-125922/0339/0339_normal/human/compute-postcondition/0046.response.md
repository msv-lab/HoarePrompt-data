To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
- `sum` is initially the second element in `bitcount` * (n - second element in `bitcount`).
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`.
- `i` is 1.
- `b` is the second element in `bitcount`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (i, b) in enumerate(bitcount):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Control Variables**:
   - The loop uses `enumerate(bitcount)` to iterate over the indices and values of `bitcount`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.
   - The loop variable `b` takes the value of `bitcount[i]` for each iteration.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `b` is the second element in `bitcount`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `b` must be set to the next element in `bitcount`, which is `bitcount[2]`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` should be incremented to 2.
   - `b` should be set to the third element in `bitcount`.

### Conclusion:
The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `b` is set to the third element in `bitcount`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is the second element in `bitcount` * (n - second element in `bitcount`) + b * (n - b) * 2, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`, `i` is 2, `b` is the third element in `bitcount`.**
