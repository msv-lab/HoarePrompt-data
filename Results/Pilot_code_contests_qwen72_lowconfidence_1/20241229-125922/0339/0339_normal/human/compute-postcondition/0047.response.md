The value of `sum` is updated by adding the product of `b`, `(n - b)`, and `2 ** i`. Given that `i` is 2, this means multiplying by 4. The value of `b` is the third element in `bitcount`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `b` is the third element in `bitcount`.
- `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `2 ** i` is `2 ** 2`, which equals 4.

So, the new value of `sum` is:
\[ \text{sum} += b \times (n - b) \times 4 \]

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is the second element in `bitcount` * (n - second element in `bitcount`) + b * (n - b) * 2 + b * (n - b) * 4, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`, `i` is 2, `b` is the third element in `bitcount`.**
