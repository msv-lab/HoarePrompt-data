To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
- `sum` is 0.
- `num` is the third element in `arr`.
- `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the third element in `arr`.
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i, s in enumerate(b):
    if i != '0':
        bitcount[i] += int(s)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `s` in the string `b` with its corresponding index `i`.
   - The condition `if i != '0'` is always true because `i` is an integer, not a string. Therefore, this condition is redundant and can be ignored.

2. **Effect on Variables**:
   - For each character `s` in `b`, `bitcount[i]` is incremented by the integer value of `s` (which is either 0 or 1).

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `bitcount` will reflect the count of 1s in each bit position of the binary representation of `num`.
   - The length of `b` determines the number of iterations. Since `b` is the reversed binary string of `num`, its length is the number of bits in the binary representation of `num`.

4. **Variables Unchanged**:
   - `n`, `arr`, `sum`, and `num` remain unchanged.
   - `b` remains the reversed binary string representation of `num`.

### Output State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\).
- `sum` is 0.
- `num` is the third element in `arr`.
- `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the third element in `arr`.
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `num` is the third element in `arr`, `b` is the reversed binary string representation of the third element in `arr`, and `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position of the binary representation of `num`.**
