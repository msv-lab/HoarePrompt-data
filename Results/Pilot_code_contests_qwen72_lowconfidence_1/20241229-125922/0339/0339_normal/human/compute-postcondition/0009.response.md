The given code snippet modifies the `bitcount` list at index `i` by adding the integer value of `s`. Here’s the detailed impact:

- `i` is 1, so the modification will affect `bitcount[1]`.
- `s` is the second character in the reversed binary string `b` of `num`.
- Since `bitcount` is initially a list of 100 zeros, except `bitcount[0]` which is 1 if the first character in `b` is '1', the value of `bitcount[1]` before the code executes is 0.
- `s` is converted to an integer and added to `bitcount[1]`.

Therefore, the value of `bitcount[1]` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether the second character in `b` is '0' or '1'.

The output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 0 ≤ A_i < 2^60
- `sum` is 0
- `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros except `bitcount[0]` is 1 if the first character in `b` is '1', and `bitcount[1]` is `int(s)`
- `num` is the first element in `arr`
- `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`
- `i` is 1
- `s` is the second character in `b`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 0 ≤ A_i < 2^60, `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 zeros except `bitcount[0]` is 1 if the first character in `b` is '1', and `bitcount[1]` is `int(s)`, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `b` is a non-empty reversed binary string representation of `num`, `i` is 1, and `s` is the second character in `b`**
