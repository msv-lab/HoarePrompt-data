The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list `A_l` of `N` integers from the standard input. It then calls another function `func_1` with `N` and `A_l` as arguments and prints the result returned by `func_1`. The function does not return any value itself, but its primary purpose is to process the input list `A_l` through `func_1` and output the result. The state of the program after `func_2` concludes is that `N` and `A_l` have been read and processed, and the result of `func_1` has been printed to the standard output.
