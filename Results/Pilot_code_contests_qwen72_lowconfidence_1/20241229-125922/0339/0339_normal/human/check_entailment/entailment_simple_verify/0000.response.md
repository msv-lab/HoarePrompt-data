Final: **False**

Reasoning:

The original assessment was marked as **True**, but upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, there is a critical issue that affects the correctness of the program. Specifically, the issue lies in the handling of the bit positions in the `bitcount` array.

### Issue in `func_1`:

1. **Bit Position Handling**:
   - The code initializes `bitcount` as a list of 100 elements, which is intended to count the number of 1s at each bit position.
   - However, the loop that processes the binary representation of each number (`b = reversed(bin(num)[2:])`) does not handle the bit positions correctly. The loop uses `enumerate` to iterate over the reversed binary string, but the condition `if i != '0':` is incorrect. The variable `i` is an integer index, not a character, so this condition will always be true.

2. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition should be `if s != '0':` to check if the current bit is '1'. The current condition `if i != '0':` will always evaluate to `True` because `i` is an integer index, not a character.

### Impact of the Issue:
- Because the condition `if i != '0':` is always true, every bit position is counted regardless of whether it is actually a '1' or '0'. This leads to incorrect bit counts in the `bitcount` array.
- As a result, the calculation of the XOR sum in the second loop will be incorrect, leading to the wrong final result.

### Corrected Code:
To fix this issue, the condition inside the loop should be changed to `if s != '0':`.

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    sum = 0
    bitcount = [0] * 100
    for num in arr:
        b = reversed(bin(num)[2:])
        for i, s in enumerate(b):
            if s != '0':
                bitcount[i] += int(s)
    for i, b in enumerate(bitcount):
        sum += b * (n - b) * 2 ** i
    return sum % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issue identified in the bit position handling, the original assessment of the program being correct is not accurate. The program does not meet the problem description due to the incorrect condition in the loop. Therefore, the final assessment is **False**.
