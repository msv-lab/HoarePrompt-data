You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have N integers. The i-th integer is A_i.

Find \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} (A_i \mbox{ XOR } A_j), modulo (10^9+7).

What is \mbox{ XOR }?

The XOR of integers A and B, A \mbox{ XOR } B, is defined as follows:

* When A \mbox{ XOR } B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k \geq 0) is 1 if either A or B, but not both, has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 otherwise.

For example, 3 \mbox{ XOR } 5 = 6. (In base two: 011 \mbox{ XOR } 101 = 110.)

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 3 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Print the value \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} (A_i \mbox{ XOR } A_j), modulo (10^9+7).

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 0 ≤ A_i < 2^60.
def func_1(n, arr):
    sum = 0
    bitcount = [0] * 100
    for num in arr:
        b = reversed(bin(num)[2:])

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`.
    for (i, b) in enumerate(bitcount):
        sum += b * (n - b) * 2 ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is the sum of \( b_i \times (n - b_i) \times 2^i \) for all \( i \) from 0 to 99, where \( b_i \) is the \( i \)-th element in `bitcount`, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`.
    return sum % (10 ** 9 + 7)
    #The program returns the value of `sum % (10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\). It calculates the sum of the products of the counts of 1s in each bit position across all elements in `arr` and the corresponding complements, multiplied by the power of 2 for that bit position. The final result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function modifies a local variable `sum` and a local list `bitcount` during its execution, but the input parameters `n` and `arr` remain unchanged. The function handles the range of inputs correctly but does not explicitly handle edge cases like empty lists or invalid input ranges, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 3 * 10^5, and A_l is a list of N integers where each element A_i satisfies 0 <= A_i < 2^60.
def func_2():
    N = int(input())
    A_l = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    print(func_1(N, A_l))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list `A_l` of `N` integers from the standard input. It then calls another function `func_1` with `N` and `A_l` as arguments and prints the result returned by `func_1`. The function does not return any value itself, but its primary purpose is to process the input list `A_l` through `func_1` and output the result. The state of the program after `func_2` concludes is that `N` and `A_l` have been read and processed, and the result of `func_1` has been printed to the standard output.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
