Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the bit position index exceeds the length of the `bitcount` list. The `bitcount` list is initialized with a fixed size of 100, but the problem constraints allow for integers up to \(2^{60} - 1\), which means the maximum bit position index can be 59. If an integer in the input has more than 100 bits set to 1, the code will attempt to access an index out of bounds in the `bitcount` list, leading to an `IndexError`.

For example, if the input includes an integer with a bit set beyond the 100th position, the function will fail. To fix this, the `bitcount` list should be initialized with a size of at least 60 to cover all possible bit positions for the given input constraints. Additionally, the condition `if i != '0':` is incorrect because `i` is an integer index, not a string. This condition should be removed or corrected to ensure proper handling of bit positions.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    sum = 0
    bitcount = [0] * 60  # Initialize bitcount to handle up to 60 bits
    for num in arr:
        b = reversed(bin(num)[2:])
        for (i, s) in enumerate(b):
            if s == '1':
                bitcount[i] += 1
    for (i, b) in enumerate(bitcount):
        sum += b * (n - b) * (2 ** i)
    return sum % MOD
```

This corrected version initializes `bitcount` with a size of 60 and correctly checks if the bit is '1' before updating the `bitcount` list. With these changes, the function should handle all potential cases correctly.
