Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the bit position index exceeds the length of the binary representation of the numbers in the array. This can lead to incorrect results because the `bitcount` list is initialized with a fixed size of 100, which may not be sufficient for the largest possible values of `A_i` (which can be up to \(2^{60} - 1\)). For example, if the input contains a number like \(2^{60} - 1\), the binary representation will have 60 bits, and the `bitcount` list will not be large enough to store the counts for all bit positions, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the `bitcount` list should be dynamically sized to accommodate the maximum number of bits in the input numbers. Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    sum = 0
    max_bits = 60  # Since A_i < 2^60
    bitcount = [0] * max_bits
    for num in arr:
        b = reversed(bin(num)[2:])
        for (i, s) in enumerate(b):
            if s != '0':
                bitcount[i] += int(s)
    for (i, b) in enumerate(bitcount):
        sum += b * (n - b) * 2 ** i
    return sum % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

This ensures that the `bitcount` list is large enough to handle the maximum possible bit positions for the given constraints.
