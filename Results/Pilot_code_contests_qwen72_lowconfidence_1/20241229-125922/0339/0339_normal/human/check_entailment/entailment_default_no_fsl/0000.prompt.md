You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have N integers. The i-th integer is A_i.

Find \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} (A_i \mbox{ XOR } A_j), modulo (10^9+7).

What is \mbox{ XOR }?

The XOR of integers A and B, A \mbox{ XOR } B, is defined as follows:

* When A \mbox{ XOR } B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k \geq 0) is 1 if either A or B, but not both, has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 otherwise.

For example, 3 \mbox{ XOR } 5 = 6. (In base two: 011 \mbox{ XOR } 101 = 110.)

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 3 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Print the value \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} (A_i \mbox{ XOR } A_j), modulo (10^9+7).

Functions with output description for each function:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, arr):
    sum = 0
    bitcount = [0] * 100
    for num in arr:
        b = reversed(bin(num)[2:])
        for (i, s) in enumerate(b):
            if i != '0':
                bitcount[i] += int(s)
    for (i, b) in enumerate(bitcount):
        sum += b * (n - b) * 2 ** i
    return sum % (10 ** 9 + 7)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\). It calculates the sum of the products of the counts of 1s in each bit position across all elements in `arr` and the corresponding complements, multiplied by the power of 2 for that bit position. The final result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function modifies a local variable `sum` and a local list `bitcount` during its execution, but the input parameters `n` and `arr` remain unchanged. The function handles the range of inputs correctly but does not explicitly handle edge cases like empty lists or invalid input ranges, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    N = int(input())
    A_l = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    print(func_1(N, A_l))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list `A_l` of `N` integers from the standard input. It then calls another function `func_1` with `N` and `A_l` as arguments and prints the result returned by `func_1`. The function does not return any value itself, but its primary purpose is to process the input list `A_l` through `func_1` and output the result. The state of the program after `func_2` concludes is that `N` and `A_l` have been read and processed, and the result of `func_1` has been printed to the standard output.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
