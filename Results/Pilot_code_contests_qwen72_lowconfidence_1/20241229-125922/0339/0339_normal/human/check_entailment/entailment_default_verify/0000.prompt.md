You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have N integers. The i-th integer is A_i.

Find \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} (A_i \mbox{ XOR } A_j), modulo (10^9+7).

What is \mbox{ XOR }?

The XOR of integers A and B, A \mbox{ XOR } B, is defined as follows:

* When A \mbox{ XOR } B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k \geq 0) is 1 if either A or B, but not both, has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 otherwise.

For example, 3 \mbox{ XOR } 5 = 6. (In base two: 011 \mbox{ XOR } 101 = 110.)

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 3 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Print the value \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} (A_i \mbox{ XOR } A_j), modulo (10^9+7).

    for (i, b) in enumerate(bitcount):
        sum += b * (n - b) * 2 ** i
    return sum % (10 ** 9 + 7)

    A_l = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes a `sum` variable to store the result.
   - It uses a `bitcount` array to count the number of times each bit position is set to 1 across all numbers in the input array.
   - For each number in the array, it converts the number to its binary representation and updates the `bitcount` array accordingly.
   - After counting the bits, it calculates the contribution of each bit position to the final XOR sum using the formula \( b \times (n - b) \times 2^i \), where \( b \) is the count of 1s at the \( i \)-th bit position, and \( n \) is the total number of elements.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the input from standard input.
   - It parses the first line to get the number of elements \( N \).
   - It parses the second line to get the array of integers.
   - It calls `func_1` with the parsed inputs and prints the result.

The program handles the constraints and the problem requirements correctly. It efficiently counts the bit positions and calculates the XOR sum for all pairs of numbers, ensuring that the result is within the specified modulo. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list `A_l` of `N` integers from the standard input. It then calls another function `func_1` with `N` and `A_l` as arguments and prints the result returned by `func_1`. The function does not return any value itself, but its primary purpose is to process the input list `A_l` through `func_1` and output the result. The state of the program after `func_2` concludes is that `N` and `A_l` have been read and processed, and the result of `func_1` has been printed to the standard output.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
