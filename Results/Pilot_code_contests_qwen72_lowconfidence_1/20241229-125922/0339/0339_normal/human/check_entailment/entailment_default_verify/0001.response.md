Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment identifies a logical error in the program, specifically in the line `if i != '0':`. This condition is incorrect because `i` is an index, not a character. The correct condition should be `if s == '1':` to properly count the bits.

The output hints confirm that the function `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` correctly, but they do not address the internal logic of `func_1`. Given the problem description and the constraints, the logical error in `func_1` would lead to incorrect bit counting, resulting in an incorrect final sum.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect due to the identified logical error.
