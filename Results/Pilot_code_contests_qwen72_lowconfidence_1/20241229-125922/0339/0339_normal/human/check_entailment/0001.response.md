Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in how it processes the bits of the numbers. Specifically, the line `if i != '0':` is incorrect because `i` is an index, not a character. This condition will always be true because `i` is an integer index, and it will never be equal to the string `'0'`. This means that the `bitcount` array will be incorrectly populated.

To fix this, the condition should check the value of `s`, which is the bit at position `i`. The correct condition should be `if s == '1':`.

Here is the corrected version of the relevant part of the code:
```python
for num in arr:
    b = reversed(bin(num)[2:])
    for (i, s) in enumerate(b):
        if s == '1':
            bitcount[i] += 1
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all potential cases. However, since the original program contains this logical error, it is considered incorrect.
