You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have N integers. The i-th integer is A_i.

Find \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} (A_i \mbox{ XOR } A_j), modulo (10^9+7).

What is \mbox{ XOR }?

The XOR of integers A and B, A \mbox{ XOR } B, is defined as follows:

* When A \mbox{ XOR } B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k \geq 0) is 1 if either A or B, but not both, has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 otherwise.

For example, 3 \mbox{ XOR } 5 = 6. (In base two: 011 \mbox{ XOR } 101 = 110.)

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 3 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Print the value \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} (A_i \mbox{ XOR } A_j), modulo (10^9+7).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 0 ≤ A_i < 2^60.
def func_1(n, arr):
    sum = 0
    bitcount = [0] * 100
    for num in arr:
        b = reversed(bin(num)[2:])
        
        for i, s in enumerate(b):
            if i != '0':
                bitcount[i] += int(s)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is 0, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`.
    for (i, b) in enumerate(bitcount):
        sum += b * (n - b) * 2 ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\), `sum` is the sum of \( b_i \times (n - b_i) \times 2^i \) for all \( i \) from 0 to 99, where \( b_i \) is the \( i \)-th element in `bitcount`, `bitcount` is a list of 100 elements where each element at index `i` represents the total count of 1s in the \(i\)-th bit position across all elements in `arr`.
    return sum % (10 ** 9 + 7)
    #The program returns the value of `sum % (10

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 3 * 10^5, and A_l is a list of N integers where each element A_i satisfies 0 <= A_i < 2^60.
def func_2():
    N = int(input())
    A_l = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    print(func_1(N, A_l))


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
