The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, where each integer is in the range \(0 \leq A_i < 2^{60}\). It calculates the sum of the products of the counts of 1s in each bit position across all elements in `arr` and the corresponding complements, multiplied by the power of 2 for that bit position. The final result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function modifies a local variable `sum` and a local list `bitcount` during its execution, but the input parameters `n` and `arr` remain unchanged. The function handles the range of inputs correctly but does not explicitly handle edge cases like empty lists or invalid input ranges, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
