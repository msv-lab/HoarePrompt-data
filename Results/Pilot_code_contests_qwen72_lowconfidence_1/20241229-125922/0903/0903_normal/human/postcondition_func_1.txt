The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from the standard input and returns it. If the input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if the user inputs a non-numeric value), a `ValueError` will be raised. The function does not handle any input validation or errors, so it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the input is valid. After the function completes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned integer value.
