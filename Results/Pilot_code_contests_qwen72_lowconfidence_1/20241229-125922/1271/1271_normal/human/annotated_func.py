#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_1(x, y):
    """greatest common divisor of x and y"""
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0. Since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, the program returns the original value of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both expected to be positive integers. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the case where either or both inputs are zero, returning the non-zero value as the GCD or 0 if both are zero.
