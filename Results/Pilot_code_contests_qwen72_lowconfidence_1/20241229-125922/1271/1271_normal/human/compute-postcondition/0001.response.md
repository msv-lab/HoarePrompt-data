According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The loop condition `while y:` means the loop will execute as long as `y` is truthy (non-zero). Since `y` is a positive integer, it is already truthy, and no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **x and y are positive integers.**
