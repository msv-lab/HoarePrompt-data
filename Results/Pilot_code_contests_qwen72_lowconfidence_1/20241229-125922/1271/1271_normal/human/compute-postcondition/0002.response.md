The values of `x` and `y` are swapped such that `x` now holds the value of `y`, and `y` now holds the value of `x % y`. Since `x` and `y` are both positive integers, the new value of `y` will be the remainder of `x` divided by `y`.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the original value of `y`, `y` is equal to the original value of `x % y`**.
