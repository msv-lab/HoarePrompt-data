The code snippet `x, y = y, x % y` performs a simultaneous assignment. This means that the new value of `x` is set to the current value of `y`, and the new value of `y` is set to the current value of `x % y`. Given the initial state:

- `x` is equal to the original value of `x % y`
- `y` must be non-zero

After executing the code:

- The new value of `x` is the original value of `y`.
- The new value of `y` is the original value of `x % y`, which is the same as the current value of `x` (since `x` was already set to `x % y` in the initial state).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is equal to the original value of `y`, `y` is equal to the original value of `x % y`**.
