The loop continues to execute as long as `y` is non-zero. Each iteration updates `x` to the current value of `y`, and `y` to the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. This process repeats until `y` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.

From the initial state where `x` and `y` are positive integers, the loop essentially implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. When the loop terminates, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`**
