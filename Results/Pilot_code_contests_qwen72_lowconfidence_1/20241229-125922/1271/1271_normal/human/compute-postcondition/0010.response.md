Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both expected to be positive integers. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the case where either or both inputs are zero, returning the non-zero value as the GCD or 0 if both are zero. **
