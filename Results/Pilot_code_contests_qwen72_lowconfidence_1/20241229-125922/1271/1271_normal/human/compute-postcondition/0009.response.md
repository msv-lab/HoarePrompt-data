The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of which are positive integers. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. Given that `y` is 0, the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, so the function returns the original value of `x`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both positive integers. It returns the original value of `x` when `y` is 0.**
