The code `x, y = y, x % y` updates the values of `x` and `y` based on their current values.

- Initially, `x` is equal to the original value of `y`.
- Initially, `y` is equal to the original value of `x % y`.

When the code executes:
- The new value of `x` becomes the current value of `y`, which is the original value of `x % y`.
- The new value of `y` becomes the current value of `x % y`, which is the original value of `(x % y) % (x % y)`.

However, since `x % y` is already the remainder of `x` divided by `y`, and taking the remainder of this result again with the same value will always yield 0 (if `y` is not zero).

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `x` is now the original value of `x % y`.
- `y` is now 0.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the original value of `x % y`, `y` is 0**.
