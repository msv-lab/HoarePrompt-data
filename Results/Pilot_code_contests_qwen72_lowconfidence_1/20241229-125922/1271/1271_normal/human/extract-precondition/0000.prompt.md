You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: One day Sasha visited the farmer 2D and his famous magnetic farm. On this farm, the crop grows due to the influence of a special magnetic field. Maintaining of the magnetic field is provided by n machines, and the power of the i-th machine is a_i. 

This year 2D decided to cultivate a new culture, but what exactly he didn't say. For the successful growth of the new culture, it is necessary to slightly change the powers of the machines. 2D can at most once choose an arbitrary integer x, then choose one machine and reduce the power of its machine by x times, and at the same time increase the power of one another machine by x times (powers of all the machines must stay positive integers). Note that he may not do that if he wants. More formally, 2D can choose two such indices i and j, and one integer x such that x is a divisor of a_i, and change powers as following: a_i = (a_i)/(x), a_j = a_j ⋅ x

Sasha is very curious, that's why he wants to calculate the minimum total power the farmer can reach. There are too many machines, and Sasha can't cope with computations, help him!

Input

The first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of machines.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the powers of the machines.

Output

Print one integer — minimum total power.

Note

In the first example, the farmer can reduce the power of the 4-th machine by 2 times, and increase the power of the 1-st machine by 2 times, then the powers will be: [2, 2, 3, 2, 5].

In the second example, the farmer can reduce the power of the 3-rd machine by 2 times, and increase the power of the 2-nd machine by 2 times. At the same time, the farmer can leave is be as it is and the total power won't change.

In the third example, it is optimal to leave it be as it is.
Program:
```
def func_2(f):
    """ Memoization decorator for a function taking a single argument. """

    class memodict(dict):

    return func_2().__getitem__
