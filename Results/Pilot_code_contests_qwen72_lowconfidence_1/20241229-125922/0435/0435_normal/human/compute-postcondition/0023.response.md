Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `bags` is the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage. If `carry` is not 0, `bags` is incremented by 1, and `carry` remains the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag. Otherwise, `bags` and `carry` retain their final values from the loop.***
