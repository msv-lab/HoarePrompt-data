The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split part into an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This operation updates the value of `a` but does not affect the value of `k`.

Output State: **`k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), `a` is a list of non-negative integers where each element `a_i` is an input integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)**
