Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `a` of non-negative integers representing the amount of garbage produced each day, and a positive integer `k` representing the capacity of each garbage bag (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The function calculates and returns the total number of garbage bags needed to carry all the garbage. 

- **Initial State:**
  - `a` is a list of non-negative integers.
  - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).

- **Behavior:**
  - The function iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`.
  - If there is any leftover garbage (`carry`) from the previous iteration, it increments the bag count (`bags`) and reduces the current day's garbage (`i`) by the leftover amount.
  - The function then calculates the number of full bags needed for the current day's garbage (`i // k`) and updates the bag count (`bags`).
  - The remaining garbage that does not fit into a full bag (`i % k`) is stored in `carry`.

- **Final State:**
  - After the loop, if there is any remaining garbage (`carry`), one additional bag is used to carry this leftover garbage, and the bag count (`bags`) is incremented by 1.
  - The function returns the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the list `a` is empty, the function returns 0 because no garbage is produced.
  - If the capacity `k` is very large compared to the elements in `a`, the function will still correctly calculate the number of bags needed, even if most days produce less garbage than the bag capacity.
  - If the capacity `k` is 1, each unit of garbage will require its own bag, and the function will return the sum of all elements in `a`.

In summary, the function `func_1` accurately calculates the total number of garbage bags required to carry all the garbage produced over the days specified in the list `a`, considering the bag capacity `k`. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list and varying capacities effectively. **
