The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `k` and `a`. `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on the input parameters.

Since the specific output conditions are not provided, I will describe the general functionality based on the given parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `k`, an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on the input parameters.**
