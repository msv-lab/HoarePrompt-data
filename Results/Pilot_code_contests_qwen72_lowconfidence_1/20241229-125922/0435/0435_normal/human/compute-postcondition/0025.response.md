The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `k`. `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of garbage produced each day, and `k` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each garbage bag such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function returns the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage. If there is any remaining garbage (`carry` is not 0) after filling the last bag, the function increments the total number of bags by 1 to account for the remaining garbage. Otherwise, the function returns the total number of bags and the remaining garbage as they are after processing all the days' garbage.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers representing the amount of garbage produced each day and a positive integer `k` representing the capacity of each garbage bag (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). It returns the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage, incrementing the count by 1 if there is any remaining garbage that does not fit into the last full bag.**
