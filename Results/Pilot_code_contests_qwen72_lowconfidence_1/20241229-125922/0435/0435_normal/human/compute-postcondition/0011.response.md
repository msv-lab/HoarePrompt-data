Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\). If `carry` is not 0, `bags` is incremented by 1, `carry` is set to `a[1] % k`, and `i` is set to `max(0, a[1] - (a[1] % k))`. If `carry` is 0, `bags` is incremented by `(a[1] // k)`, `carry` is set to `a[1] % k`, and `i` is set to `a[1]`.***
