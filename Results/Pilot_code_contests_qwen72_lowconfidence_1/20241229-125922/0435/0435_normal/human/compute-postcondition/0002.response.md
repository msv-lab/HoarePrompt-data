The code snippet involves calling the function `func_1` twice with different arguments and printing the minimum of the two results. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values returned by `func_1`. However, we can describe the impact of the code on the program state.

1. `func_1(a, k)` is called, which returns some value, let's call it `result_1`.
2. `a[::-1]` creates a reversed copy of the list `a`.
3. `func_1(a[::-1], k)` is called, which returns some value, let's call it `result_2`.
4. `min(result_1, result_2)` is computed, and the result is printed.

Since the code does not modify any of the initial variables (`k` or `a`), their values remain unchanged. The only action taken is the print operation, which does not affect the state of the program.

Output State: **`k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), `a` is a list of non-negative integers where each element `a_i` is an input integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)**
