Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads two inputs: an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) and a list of non-negative integers `a` (where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It then computes the minimum value between the result of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)`, where `a[::-1]` is the reversed list of `a`. Finally, it prints this minimum value. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the result to the console. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input values `k` and `a` remain unchanged, and the computed minimum value has been printed. **

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads `k` and `a` from the standard input.
- **Computation**: It calls `func_1` twice, once with the original list `a` and once with the reversed list `a[::-1]`.
- **Output**: The minimum value of the two results is printed to the console.
- **State After Execution**: The input variables `k` and `a` are not modified, and the only side effect is the printed output.
