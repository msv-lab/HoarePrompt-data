The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `a` of non-negative integers representing the amount of garbage produced each day, and a positive integer `k` representing the capacity of each garbage bag (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The function calculates and returns the total number of garbage bags needed to carry all the garbage.
