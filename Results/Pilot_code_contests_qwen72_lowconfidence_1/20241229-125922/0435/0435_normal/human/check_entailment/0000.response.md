Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the garbage produced on the last day cannot fit into a single bag due to the remaining carry from the previous days. This results in an incorrect number of bags being calculated.

Example Case:
- Input: `3 2\n1 1 3`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Actual Output: `4`

In this case, the program calculates the number of bags incorrectly because it does not properly account for the carry when it spans across the last day. On the last day, the program should recognize that the carry from the previous day plus the garbage produced on the last day requires only two bags (one for the carry and one for the remaining garbage), but the program incorrectly adds an extra bag.
