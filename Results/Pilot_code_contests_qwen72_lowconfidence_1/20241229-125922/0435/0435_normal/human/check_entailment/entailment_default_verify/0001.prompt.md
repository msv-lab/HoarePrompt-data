You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Enough is enough. Too many times it happened that Vasya forgot to dispose of garbage and his apartment stank afterwards. Now he wants to create a garbage disposal plan and stick to it.

For each of next n days Vasya knows a_i — number of units of garbage he will produce on the i-th day. Each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. Vasya disposes of garbage by putting it inside a bag and dropping the bag into a garbage container. Each bag can contain up to k units of garbage. It is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags into a garbage container in a single day.

Being economical, Vasya wants to use as few bags as possible. You are to compute the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage for the given n days. No garbage should be left after the n-th day.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — number of days to consider and bag's capacity. The second line contains n space separated integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of units of garbage produced on the i-th day.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage. Each unit of garbage should be disposed on the day it was produced or on the next day. No garbage can be left after the n-th day. In a day it is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags.

Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import itertools
import sys
from atexit import register
from io import BytesIO
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, k):
    (bags, carry) = (0, 0)
    for i in a:
        if carry != 0:
            bags += 1
            i = max(0, i - carry)
        bags += i // k
        carry = i % k
    if carry != 0:
        bags += 1
    return bags

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (_, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    print(min(func_1(a, k), func_1(a[::-1], k)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in `func_2` where it incorrectly uses the `min` function to compare the results of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)`. This approach is flawed because the problem requires that all garbage be disposed of by the end of the n-th day, and reversing the array and comparing the results does not ensure that this requirement is met.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 2
1 0 1
```
The correct output should be `2` because:
- On the first day, Vasya produces 1 unit of garbage. He can put it in a bag.
- On the second day, he produces 0 units of garbage, so no action is needed.
- On the third day, he produces 1 unit of garbage. He can put it in another bag.

However, the program will incorrectly reverse the array and compare the results, leading to an incorrect output. This is a clear violation of the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads two inputs: an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) and a list of non-negative integers `a` (where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It then computes the minimum value between the result of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)`, where `a[::-1]` is the reversed list of `a`. Finally, it prints this minimum value. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the result to the console. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input values `k` and `a` remain unchanged, and the computed minimum value has been printed.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
