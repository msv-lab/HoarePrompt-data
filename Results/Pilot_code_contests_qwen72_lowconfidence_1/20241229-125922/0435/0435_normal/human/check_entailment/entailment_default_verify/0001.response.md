Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The key issue lies in the logic of `func_2`, which incorrectly uses the `min` function to compare the results of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)`. This approach is flawed because the problem requires that all garbage be disposed of by the end of the n-th day, and reversing the array and comparing the results does not ensure that this requirement is met.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 2
1 0 1
```
The correct output should be `2` because:
- On the first day, Vasya produces 1 unit of garbage. He can put it in a bag.
- On the second day, he produces 0 units of garbage, so no action is needed.
- On the third day, he produces 1 unit of garbage. He can put it in another bag.

However, the program will incorrectly reverse the array and compare the results, leading to an incorrect output. This is a clear violation of the problem requirements.

The output hints confirm that `func_2` computes the minimum value between the result of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)`, which is logically flawed for the reasons stated above. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
