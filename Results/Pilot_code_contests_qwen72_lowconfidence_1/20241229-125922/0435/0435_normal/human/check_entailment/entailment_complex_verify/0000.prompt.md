You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Enough is enough. Too many times it happened that Vasya forgot to dispose of garbage and his apartment stank afterwards. Now he wants to create a garbage disposal plan and stick to it.

For each of next n days Vasya knows a_i — number of units of garbage he will produce on the i-th day. Each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. Vasya disposes of garbage by putting it inside a bag and dropping the bag into a garbage container. Each bag can contain up to k units of garbage. It is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags into a garbage container in a single day.

Being economical, Vasya wants to use as few bags as possible. You are to compute the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage for the given n days. No garbage should be left after the n-th day.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — number of days to consider and bag's capacity. The second line contains n space separated integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of units of garbage produced on the i-th day.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage. Each unit of garbage should be disposed on the day it was produced or on the next day. No garbage can be left after the n-th day. In a day it is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags.

from atexit import register
from io import BytesIO
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, k):
    (bags, carry) = (0, 0)
    for i in a:
        if carry != 0:
            bags += 1
            i = max(0, i - carry)
        bags += i // k
        carry = i % k
    if carry != 0:
        bags += 1
    return bags

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (_, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    print(min(func_1(a, k), func_1(a[::-1], k)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the garbage produced on the last day cannot fit into a single bag due to the remaining carry from the previous days. This results in an incorrect number of bags being calculated.

Example Case:
- Input: `3 2\n1 1 3`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Actual Output: `4`

In this case, the program calculates the number of bags incorrectly because it does not properly account for the carry when it spans across the last day. On the last day, the program should recognize that the carry from the previous day plus the garbage produced on the last day requires only two bags (one for the carry and one for the remaining garbage), but the program incorrectly adds an extra bag.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop over all iterations. Let's break down the logic step by step:
    #
    #1. **Initial State:**
    #   - `a` is a list of non-negative integers.
    #   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
    #   - `bags` is initialized to 0.
    #   - `carry` is initialized to 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Behavior:**
    #   - For each element `i` in the list `a`:
    #     - If `carry` is not 0, increment `bags` by 1 and update `i` to `max(0, i - carry)`.
    #     - Increment `bags` by `i // k`.
    #     - Update `carry` to `i % k`.
    #
    #3. **Final State After All Iterations:**
    #   - The loop will iterate through all elements of `a`.
    #   - For each element `i` in `a`, the number of bags used is calculated based on the current value of `carry` and the value of `i`.
    #   - The final value of `bags` will be the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage.
    #   - The final value of `carry` will be the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag.
    #
    #4. **Detailed Final State:**
    #   - `a` remains a list of non-negative integers (unchanged).
    #   - `k` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\) (unchanged).
    #   - `bags` will be the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage.
    #   - `carry` will be the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag.
    #
    #If the list `a` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the values of `bags` and `carry` remain 0.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
    #**`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `bags` is the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage, `carry` is the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag.**
    if (carry != 0) :
        bags += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `bags` is the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage. If `carry` is not 0, `bags` is incremented by 1, and `carry` remains the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag. Otherwise, `bags` and `carry` retain their final values from the loop.
    return bags
    #The program returns the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage. If `carry` is not 0, `bags` is incremented by 1, and `carry` remains the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag. Otherwise, `bags` and `carry` retain their final values from the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `a` of non-negative integers representing the amount of garbage produced each day, and a positive integer `k` representing the capacity of each garbage bag (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The function calculates and returns the total number of garbage bags needed to carry all the garbage.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of non-negative integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    _, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    print(min(func_1(a, k), func_1(a[::-1], k)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two inputs: an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) and a list of non-negative integers `a` (where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It then computes the minimum value between the result of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)`, where `a[::-1]` is the reversed list of `a`. Finally, it prints this minimum value. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the result to the console. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input values `k` and `a` remain unchanged, and the computed minimum value has been printed.
