Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_2` computes the minimum value between the result of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)`. This approach is incorrect because it assumes that reversing the list and calculating the number of bags could yield a more optimal solution, which is not necessarily true according to the problem description.

The problem requires that each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. Reversing the list and calculating the number of bags does not align with this requirement, as it could lead to garbage being "disposed" before it was produced, which is not allowed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input:
3 2
1 0 1
```
- The correct output should be 2, as the garbage from the first day can be carried over to the second day, and the garbage from the third day can be disposed of on the third day.
- However, `func_2` will calculate `func_1([1, 0, 1], 2)` and `func_1([1, 0, 1][::-1], 2)`, which is `func_1([1, 0, 1], 2)`. Both will yield 2, so the output will be 2, which is correct in this case.

However, consider another input:
```
Input:
3 2
1 2 1
```
- The correct output should be 2, as the garbage from the first day can be combined with part of the garbage from the second day to fill one bag, and the remaining garbage from the second day can be combined with the garbage from the third day to fill another bag.
- However, `func_2` will calculate `func_1([1, 2, 1], 2)` and `func_1([1, 2, 1][::-1], 2)`, which is `func_1([1, 2, 1], 2)`. Both will yield 2, so the output will be 2, which is correct in this case as well.

The issue arises when the order of garbage production is significant, and reversing the list changes the order in a way that does not align with the problem constraints. For example:
```
Input:
4 2
1 3 1 1
```
- The correct output should be 3, as the garbage from the first day can be combined with part of the garbage from the second day to fill one bag, the remaining garbage from the second day can be combined with the garbage from the third day to fill another bag, and the garbage from the fourth day can be disposed of in a third bag.
- However, `func_2` will calculate `func_1([1, 3, 1, 1], 2)` and `func_1([1, 1, 3, 1], 2)`. The first call will correctly yield 3, but the second call will yield 4, leading to the output 3, which is correct in this case.

However, the approach of reversing the list and comparing the results is fundamentally flawed because it does not respect the constraint that garbage must be disposed of on the day it is produced or the next day. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
