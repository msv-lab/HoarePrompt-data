You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Enough is enough. Too many times it happened that Vasya forgot to dispose of garbage and his apartment stank afterwards. Now he wants to create a garbage disposal plan and stick to it.

For each of next n days Vasya knows a_i — number of units of garbage he will produce on the i-th day. Each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. Vasya disposes of garbage by putting it inside a bag and dropping the bag into a garbage container. Each bag can contain up to k units of garbage. It is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags into a garbage container in a single day.

Being economical, Vasya wants to use as few bags as possible. You are to compute the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage for the given n days. No garbage should be left after the n-th day.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — number of days to consider and bag's capacity. The second line contains n space separated integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of units of garbage produced on the i-th day.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage. Each unit of garbage should be disposed on the day it was produced or on the next day. No garbage can be left after the n-th day. In a day it is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of garbage produced each day, and k is a positive integer representing the capacity of each garbage bag such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a, k):
    bags, carry = 0, 0
    for i in a:
        if carry != 0:
            bags += 1

        bags += i // k
        
        carry = i % k
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop over all iterations. Let's break down the logic step by step:
    #
    #1. **Initial State:**
    #   - `a` is a list of non-negative integers.
    #   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
    #   - `bags` is initialized to 0.
    #   - `carry` is initialized to 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Behavior:**
    #   - For each element `i` in the list `a`:
    #     - If `carry` is not 0, increment `bags` by 1 and update `i` to `max(0, i - carry)`.
    #     - Increment `bags` by `i // k`.
    #     - Update `carry` to `i % k`.
    #
    #3. **Final State After All Iterations:**
    #   - The loop will iterate through all elements of `a`.
    #   - For each element `i` in `a`, the number of bags used is calculated based on the current value of `carry` and the value of `i`.
    #   - The final value of `bags` will be the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage.
    #   - The final value of `carry` will be the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag.
    #
    #4. **Detailed Final State:**
    #   - `a` remains a list of non-negative integers (unchanged).
    #   - `k` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\) (unchanged).
    #   - `bags` will be the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage.
    #   - `carry` will be the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag.
    #
    #If the list `a` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the values of `bags` and `carry` remain 0.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
    #**`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `bags` is the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage, `carry` is the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag.**
    if (carry != 0) :
        bags += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `bags` is the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage. If `carry` is not 0, `bags` is incremented by 1, and `carry` remains the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag. Otherwise, `bags` and `carry` retain their final values from the loop.
    return bags
    #The program returns the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage. If `carry` is not 0, `bags` is incremented by 1, and `carry` remains the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag. Otherwise, `bags` and `carry` retain their final values from the loop.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of non-negative integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    _, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    print(min(func_1(a, k), func_1(a[::-1], k)))


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
