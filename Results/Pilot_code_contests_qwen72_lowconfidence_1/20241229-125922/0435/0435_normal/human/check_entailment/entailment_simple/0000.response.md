Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description in certain cases. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Garbage Disposal Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of bags needed to dispose of garbage for a given sequence of days. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where garbage can be carried over to the next day.
   - Specifically, the program increments the number of bags whenever there is leftover garbage (`carry`), even if this garbage can be carried over to the next day. This leads to an overestimation of the number of bags needed.

2. **Incorrect Use of Minimum Function:**
   - The function `func_2` calls `func_1` twice, once with the original list `a` and once with the reversed list `a[::-1]`. It then prints the minimum of the two results.
   - This approach is flawed because the problem requires that each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. Reversing the list and taking the minimum of the two results does not ensure that the garbage is disposed of according to the rules specified in the problem.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:

Consider the following input:
```
3 2
1 0 1
```

- **Expected Output:** 2
- **Actual Output:** 2 (but the logic is flawed)

**Explanation:**
- On the first day, 1 unit of garbage is produced. It can be disposed of using 1 bag.
- On the second day, no garbage is produced.
- On the third day, 1 unit of garbage is produced. It can be disposed of using 1 bag.
- The total number of bags needed is 2.

However, the program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the carry-over of garbage to the next day. If the program were to reverse the list and take the minimum, it would still produce the correct result in this case, but it would fail in more complex scenarios.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate through the list of daily garbage production.
2. Keep track of the current carry-over garbage.
3. Calculate the number of bags needed for each day, considering the carry-over from the previous day.
4. Ensure that any leftover garbage is carried over to the next day.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(a, k):
    bags, carry = 0, 0
    for i in a:
        total_garbage = i + carry
        bags += (total_garbage + k - 1) // k  # Ceiling division to account for carry
        carry = total_garbage % k
    return bags

def func_2():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    print(func_1(a, k))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the garbage is correctly disposed of according to the rules specified in the problem description.
