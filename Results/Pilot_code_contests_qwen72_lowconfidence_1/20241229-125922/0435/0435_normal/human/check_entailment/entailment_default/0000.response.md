Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_2` computes the minimum value between the result of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)`. However, this approach is incorrect because the problem specifies that each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. Reversing the list `a` and computing the number of bags required does not align with the problem constraints, as it allows garbage to be disposed of on previous days, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 2
1 0 1
```
The correct output should be 2, as the garbage can be disposed of as follows:
- Day 1: 1 unit of garbage is produced and put into a bag.
- Day 2: No garbage is produced.
- Day 3: 1 unit of garbage is produced and added to the bag from Day 1, which now has 2 units of garbage.

However, if we reverse the list `a` to `[1, 0, 1]` and apply `func_1`, it would incorrectly consider disposing of the garbage on previous days, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
