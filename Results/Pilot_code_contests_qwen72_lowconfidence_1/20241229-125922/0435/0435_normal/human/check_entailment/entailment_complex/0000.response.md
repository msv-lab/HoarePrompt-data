Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_2` computes the minimum value between the result of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The problem requires that each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. By considering the reversed list `a[::-1]`, the program allows garbage to be disposed of before it is produced, which violates the constraints of the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 2
3 2 1
```
- The correct output should be 3 because:
  - Day 1: 3 units of garbage, 1 bag (2 units) + 1 unit carried over.
  - Day 2: 2 units of garbage + 1 unit carried over, 1 bag (2 units) + 1 unit carried over.
  - Day 3: 1 unit of garbage + 1 unit carried over, 1 bag (2 units).

However, the program will also consider the reversed list `[1, 2, 3]`:
- Day 1: 1 unit of garbage, 1 bag (1 unit).
- Day 2: 2 units of garbage, 1 bag (2 units).
- Day 3: 3 units of garbage, 1 bag (2 units) + 1 unit carried over.

This results in 3 bags, which is the same as the original order. However, if the input were:
```
3 2
1 3 1
```
- The correct output should be 3 because:
  - Day 1: 1 unit of garbage, 1 bag (1 unit).
  - Day 2: 3 units of garbage, 1 bag (2 units) + 1 unit carried over.
  - Day 3: 1 unit of garbage + 1 unit carried over, 1 bag (2 units).

However, the reversed list `[1, 3, 1]` would incorrectly allow the following:
- Day 1: 1 unit of garbage, 1 bag (1 unit).
- Day 2: 3 units of garbage, 1 bag (2 units) + 1 unit carried over.
- Day 3: 1 unit of garbage + 1 unit carried over, 1 bag (2 units).

This results in 3 bags, but the program might incorrectly consider the reversed order, leading to an incorrect result.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
