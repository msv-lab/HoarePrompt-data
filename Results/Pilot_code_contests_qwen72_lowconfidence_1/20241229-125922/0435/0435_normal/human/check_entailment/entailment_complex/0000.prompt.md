You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Enough is enough. Too many times it happened that Vasya forgot to dispose of garbage and his apartment stank afterwards. Now he wants to create a garbage disposal plan and stick to it.

For each of next n days Vasya knows a_i — number of units of garbage he will produce on the i-th day. Each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. Vasya disposes of garbage by putting it inside a bag and dropping the bag into a garbage container. Each bag can contain up to k units of garbage. It is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags into a garbage container in a single day.

Being economical, Vasya wants to use as few bags as possible. You are to compute the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage for the given n days. No garbage should be left after the n-th day.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — number of days to consider and bag's capacity. The second line contains n space separated integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of units of garbage produced on the i-th day.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage. Each unit of garbage should be disposed on the day it was produced or on the next day. No garbage can be left after the n-th day. In a day it is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags.

        if carry != 0:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop over all iterations. Let's break down the logic step by step:
    #
    #1. **Initial State:**
    #   - `a` is a list of non-negative integers.
    #   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
    #   - `bags` is initialized to 0.
    #   - `carry` is initialized to 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Behavior:**
    #   - For each element `i` in the list `a`:
    #     - If `carry` is not 0, increment `bags` by 1 and update `i` to `max(0, i - carry)`.
    #     - Increment `bags` by `i // k`.
    #     - Update `carry` to `i % k`.
    #
    #3. **Final State After All Iterations:**
    #   - The loop will iterate through all elements of `a`.
    #   - For each element `i` in `a`, the number of bags used is calculated based on the current value of `carry` and the value of `i`.
    #   - The final value of `bags` will be the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage.
    #   - The final value of `carry` will be the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag.
    #
    #4. **Detailed Final State:**
    #   - `a` remains a list of non-negative integers (unchanged).
    #   - `k` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\) (unchanged).
    #   - `bags` will be the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage.
    #   - `carry` will be the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag.
    #
    #If the list `a` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the values of `bags` and `carry` remain 0.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
    #**`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `bags` is the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage, `carry` is the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag.**
    if (carry != 0) :
        bags += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `bags` is the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage. If `carry` is not 0, `bags` is incremented by 1, and `carry` remains the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag. Otherwise, `bags` and `carry` retain their final values from the loop.
    return bags
    #The program returns the total number of bags used to carry all the garbage. If `carry` is not 0, `bags` is incremented by 1, and `carry` remains the remaining garbage that could not fit into the last full bag. Otherwise, `bags` and `carry` retain their final values from the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `a` of non-negative integers representing the amount of garbage produced each day, and a positive integer `k` representing the capacity of each garbage bag (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The function calculates and returns the total number of garbage bags needed to carry all the garbage.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of non-negative integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    _, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    print(min(func_1(a, k), func_1(a[::-1], k)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two inputs: an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) and a list of non-negative integers `a` (where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It then computes the minimum value between the result of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)`, where `a[::-1]` is the reversed list of `a`. Finally, it prints this minimum value. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the result to the console. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input values `k` and `a` remain unchanged, and the computed minimum value has been printed.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
