The code snippet `max_len = tmp` updates the value of `max_len` to the current value of `tmp`. Based on the initial state, `tmp` is updated based on the value of `a[2]`:

- If `a[2]` is not equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is set to 0.
- If `a[2]` equals `max_a`, `tmp` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the value of `max_len` will be updated to either 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[2]` equals `max_a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 2, `max_len` is either 0 or 1 (depending on whether `a[2]` equals `max_a`), and `tmp` is either 0 or 1 (depending on whether `a[2]` equals `max_a`).**
