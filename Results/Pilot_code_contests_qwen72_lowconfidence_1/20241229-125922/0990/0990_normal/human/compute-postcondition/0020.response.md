The code initializes the variable `tmp` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `max_avg`, `max_a`, or `i`. The condition regarding `max_len` and `tmp` remains unchanged since `tmp` was just initialized and has not yet been compared to `max_len`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 1, `tmp` is 0. If `tmp` > `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to `tmp`. Otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged and `tmp` remains unchanged.**
