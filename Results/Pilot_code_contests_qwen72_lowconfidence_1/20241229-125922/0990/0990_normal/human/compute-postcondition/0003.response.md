The value of `max_a` is assigned the maximum value from the list `a`. The values of `n`, `a`, `max_avg`, and `max_len` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_len` is the length of the longest subarray that has this maximum average, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`.**
