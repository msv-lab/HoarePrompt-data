The code snippet initializes the variable `tmp` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `tmp`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is 0, and `max_len` is updated to `tmp` if `tmp` > `max_len`; otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged.**
