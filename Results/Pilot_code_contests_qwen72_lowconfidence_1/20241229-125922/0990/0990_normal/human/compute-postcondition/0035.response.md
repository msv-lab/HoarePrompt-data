The code prints the value of `max_len`. This does not alter any variables or their values; it only outputs the current value of `max_len`. Therefore, the state of the program remains the same except for the side effect of printing `max_len`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `i` is \(n-1\). If `tmp` is greater than `max_len`, `max_len` is updated to the value of `tmp`, which is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `max_a` values or 0 if the last element is not `max_a`. Otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged.**
