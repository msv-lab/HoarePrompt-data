To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`.
- `max_len` is 0.
- `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`.
- `tmp` is 0.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the list `a` and updates the variables `max_len` and `tmp` based on whether the current element `a[i]` is equal to `max_a`.

### Loop Execution:
- For each `i` in the range from 0 to \(n-1\):
  - If `a[i]` is not equal to `max_a`:
    - If `tmp` is greater than `max_len`, update `max_len` to `tmp`.
    - Reset `tmp` to 0.
  - If `a[i]` is equal to `max_a`:
    - Increment `tmp` by 1.

### Final State:
- After the loop finishes, `max_len` will hold the length of the longest contiguous subarray in `a` where all elements are equal to `max_a`.
- `tmp` will be the length of the last contiguous subarray of `max_a` values, or 0 if the last element is not `max_a`.
- `i` will be \(n-1\), the last index of the list `a`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `max_avg`, and `max_a` remain unchanged.

### Summary:
- `n` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` remains a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `max_avg` remains the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`.
- `max_a` remains the maximum value in `a`.
- `max_len` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray in `a` where all elements are equal to `max_a`.
- `tmp` is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `max_a` values, or 0 if the last element is not `max_a`.
- `i` is \(n-1\).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `max_len` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray in `a` where all elements are equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `max_a` values, or 0 if the last element is not `max_a`, `i` is \(n-1\).**
