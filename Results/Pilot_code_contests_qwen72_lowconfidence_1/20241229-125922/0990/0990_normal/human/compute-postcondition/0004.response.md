The value of `max_len` is set to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `max_avg`, and `max_a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_len` is 0, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`.**
