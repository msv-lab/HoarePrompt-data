Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 2, `max_len` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is updated based on the value of `a[2]` (if `a[2]` is not equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is set to 0; if `a[2]` equals `max_a`, `tmp` is incremented by 1). If `tmp` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to the value of `tmp`. Otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged.***
