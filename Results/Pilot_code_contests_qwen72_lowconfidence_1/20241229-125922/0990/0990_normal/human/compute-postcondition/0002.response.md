The provided Python code snippet aims to find the maximum average of any contiguous subarray within the list `a` and also determine the length of this subarray. Here’s the impact of the code on the program:

- `max_avg` starts at 0 and gets updated whenever a new subarray's average is found that is higher than the current `max_avg`.
- `max_len` starts at 0 and gets updated to the length of the subarray whose average equals the current `max_avg` but is longer than the current `max_len`.
- The code iterates through all possible subarrays of `a` from indices `i` to `j` (inclusive), calculates their average, and updates `max_avg` and `max_len` accordingly.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 (updated from input).
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.

After executing the code:
- `max_avg` will be the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`.
- `max_len` will be the length of the longest subarray that has this maximum average.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_len` is the length of the longest subarray that has this maximum average.**
