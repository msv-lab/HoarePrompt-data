To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`.
- `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`.
- `i` is 0.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `max_a`, then `max_len` is updated to `tmp` if `tmp` > `max_len`; otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is 0.
- If `a[i]` is equal to `max_a`, then `max_len` is 0, `tmp` is 1, and `i` is 0.
- Otherwise, the values of `max_len`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The other variables (`max_avg`, `max_a`, `max_len`, `tmp`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 1, `max_len` remains unchanged, `tmp` remains unchanged.**
