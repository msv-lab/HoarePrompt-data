The value of `max_len` is updated to the value of `tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_len` is `tmp`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `tmp` is greater than `max_len`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `max_a`.**
