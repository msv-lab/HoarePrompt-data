Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 1. If `tmp` > `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to `tmp`. Otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged and `tmp` remains unchanged.***
