The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `tmp` is updated based on the value of `a[2]` (if `a[2]` is not equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is set to 0; if `a[2]` equals `max_a`, `tmp` is incremented by 1), and assuming `tmp` was already updated according to these rules before this snippet, the value of `tmp` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `tmp` could have been set to 0 or incremented by 1 depending on the condition involving `a[2]` and `max_a`, the exact initial value of `tmp` is not specified. However, since the code increments `tmp` by 1, the new value of `tmp` will be:

- If `a[2]` was not equal to `max_a`, `tmp` was initially 0, and now `tmp` is 1.
- If `a[2]` was equal to `max_a`, `tmp` was initially 1 (or more, depending on previous updates), and now `tmp` is 2 (or the initial value plus 1).

The rest of the variables (`n`, `a`, `max_avg`, `max_a`, `i`, `max_len`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 2, `max_len` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is incremented by 1.**
