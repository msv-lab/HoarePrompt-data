To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the current state and how the loop variable `i` changes at the start of each iteration.

### Current State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`.
- `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_len` remains unchanged.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is set to 0.
- If `tmp` > `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to `tmp`.
- Otherwise, if `a[i]` equals `max_a`, `tmp` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. **Other Variables**:
   - `max_avg` and `max_a` remain unchanged because they are not modified in the loop condition.
   - `max_len` remains unchanged unless `tmp` exceeds it during the loop execution.
   - `tmp` will be updated based on the value of `a[i]` at the start of the next iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- `a[i]` will now refer to `a[2]`.
- `tmp` will be updated based on the value of `a[2]`:
  - If `a[2]` is not equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is set to 0.
  - If `a[2]` is equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is incremented by 1.
- `max_len` will only be updated if `tmp` exceeds its current value.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 2, `max_len` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is updated based on the value of `a[2]` (if `a[2]` is not equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is set to 0; if `a[2]` equals `max_a`, `tmp` is incremented by 1).**
