Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_len` is 0, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `tmp` is 0, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is equal to `max_a`**
