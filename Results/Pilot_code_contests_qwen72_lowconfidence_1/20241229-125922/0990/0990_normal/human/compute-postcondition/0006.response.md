To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`.
   - `max_len` is 0.
   - `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`.
   - `tmp` is 0.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for i in range(0, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if the range from 0 to `n` (exclusive) contains at least one element.
   - This means `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - Since `n` is already given as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), it ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

5. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) (no change needed).
   - `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) (no change needed).
   - `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a` (no change needed).
   - `max_len` is 0 (no change needed).
   - `max_a` is the maximum value in `a` (no change needed).
   - `tmp` is 0 (no change needed).
   - `i` is 0 (new state).

Therefore, the state after adjustments for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_len` is 0, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `tmp` is 0, `i` is 0**
