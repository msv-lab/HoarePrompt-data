The code snippet `a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 (updated from input)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9

After executing the code snippet, the list `a` is updated to contain the integers read from the input. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 (updated from input), `a` is a list of integers read from the input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9**
