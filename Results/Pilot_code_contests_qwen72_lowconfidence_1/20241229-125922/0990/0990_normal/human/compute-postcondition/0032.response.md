Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `max_len` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray in `a` where all elements are equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `max_a` values, or 0 if the last element is not `max_a`, `i` is \(n-1\). The current value of `tmp` is greater than `max_len`.***
