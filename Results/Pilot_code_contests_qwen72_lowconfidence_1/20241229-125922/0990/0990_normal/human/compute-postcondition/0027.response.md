The code snippet sets `tmp` to 0. This affects the value of `tmp` but does not change the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 2, `max_len` remains unchanged, `tmp` is 0.**
