Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, and `a[i]` is equal to `max_a`. If `a[i]` is equal to `max_a`, then `max_len` is 0, `tmp` is 1, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `max_len`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
