Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input as specified. It reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input. This matches the input format described in the problem.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value**: The program finds the maximum value `max_a` in the list `a`. This step is crucial because the subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean will always consist of the maximum value repeated.

3. **Finding the Longest Subsegment with Maximum Value**: The program iterates through the list `a` to find the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are equal to `max_a`. It keeps track of the current length of such a subarray using the variable `tmp` and updates `max_len` whenever a longer subarray is found.

4. **Handling the Last Subarray**: After the loop, the program checks if the last subarray of `max_a` values is the longest and updates `max_len` accordingly. This ensures that the longest subarray is correctly identified even if it ends at the last element of the list.

5. **Output**: The program prints the length of the longest subarray with the maximum value, which corresponds to the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean.

The program efficiently finds the longest subarray with the maximum value, which is equivalent to finding the subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean. This approach is both correct and efficient, avoiding the need for nested loops that would make the solution O(n^2). Instead, it runs in O(n) time, which is suitable for the constraints given (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
