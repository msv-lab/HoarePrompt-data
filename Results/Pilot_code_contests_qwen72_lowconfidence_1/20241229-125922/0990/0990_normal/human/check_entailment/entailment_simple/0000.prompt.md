You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Find the subsegment a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) with maximum arithmetic mean (1)/(r - l + 1)∑_{i=l}^{r}{a_i} (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).

If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the array a.

Output

Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.

Example

Input


5
6 1 6 6 0


Output


2

Note

The subsegment [3, 4] is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    """
max_avg = 0
max_len = 0
for i in range(0, n):
    for j in range(i, n):
        tmp = sum(a[i:j+1])/float(j-i+1)
        if tmp > max_avg:
            max_avg = tmp
            max_len = (j-i+1)
        elif tmp == max_avg:
            if (j-i+1) > max_len:
                max_len = (j-i+1)
"""
    max_a = max(a)
    max_len = 0
    tmp = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        if a[i] != max_a:
            if tmp > max_len:
                max_len = tmp
            tmp = 0
        elif a[i] == max_a:
            tmp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `max_len` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray in `a` where all elements are equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `max_a` values, or 0 if the last element is not `max_a`, `i` is \(n-1\).
    if (tmp > max_len) :
        max_len = tmp
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `i` is \(n-1\). If `tmp` is greater than `max_len`, `max_len` is updated to the value of `tmp`, which is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `max_a` values or 0 if the last element is not `max_a`. Otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged.
    print(max_len)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
