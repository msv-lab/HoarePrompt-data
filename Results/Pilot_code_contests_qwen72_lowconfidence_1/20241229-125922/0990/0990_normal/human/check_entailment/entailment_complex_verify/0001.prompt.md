You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Find the subsegment a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) with maximum arithmetic mean (1)/(r - l + 1)∑_{i=l}^{r}{a_i} (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).

If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the array a.

Output

Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.

Example

Input


5
6 1 6 6 0


Output


2

Note

The subsegment [3, 4] is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    '\nmax_avg = 0\nmax_len = 0\nfor i in range(0, n):\n    for j in range(i, n):\n        tmp = sum(a[i:j+1])/float(j-i+1)\n        if tmp > max_avg:\n            max_avg = tmp\n            max_len = (j-i+1)\n        elif tmp == max_avg:\n            if (j-i+1) > max_len:\n                max_len = (j-i+1)\n'
    max_a = max(a)
    max_len = 0
    tmp = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        if a[i] != max_a:
            if tmp > max_len:
                max_len = tmp
            tmp = 0
        elif a[i] == max_a:
            tmp += 1
    if tmp > max_len:
        max_len = tmp
    print(max_len)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_a` is set to the maximum value in the array `a`.
   - `max_len` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the length of the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean.
   - `tmp` is initialized to 0 to count the current length of the subsegment being considered.

2. **Iterating through the array**:
   - For each element in the array, the program checks if the element is equal to `max_a`.
   - If the element is equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is incremented to extend the current subsegment.
   - If the element is not equal to `max_a`, the current subsegment ends, and `tmp` is compared to `max_len`. If `tmp` is greater than `max_len`, `max_len` is updated to `tmp`, and `tmp` is reset to 0.

3. **Final check**:
   - After the loop, there is a final check to update `max_len` if `tmp` is greater than `max_len`.

This approach ensures that the program finds the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean, which is the highest value in the array. The program correctly handles edge cases and different input scenarios, making it correct for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

"""
    max_a = max(a)
    max_len = 0
    tmp = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        if a[i] != max_a:
            if tmp > max_len:
                max_len = tmp

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `max_len` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray in `a` where all elements are equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `max_a` values, or 0 if the last element is not `max_a`, `i` is \(n-1\).
    if (tmp > max_len) :
        max_len = tmp
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray in `a`, `max_a` is the maximum value in `a`, `i` is \(n-1\). If `tmp` is greater than `max_len`, `max_len` is updated to the value of `tmp`, which is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `max_a` values or 0 if the last element is not `max_a`. Otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged.
    print(max_len)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input: the first line is a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the second line is a space-separated list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It then processes this list to find the maximum value in the list (`max_a`) and the length of the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are equal to `max_a`. Finally, it prints the length of this longest contiguous subarray. If the list is empty or contains no elements equal to `max_a`, the function will print 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
