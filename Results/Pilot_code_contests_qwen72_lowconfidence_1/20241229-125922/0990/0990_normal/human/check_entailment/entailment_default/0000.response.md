Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the solution to find the longest subsegment with the maximum possible arithmetic mean in the array. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The code reads the input as specified, taking the length `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Finding Maximum Value**: It determines the maximum value in the array (`max_a`). This is crucial because the maximum possible arithmetic mean of any subsegment is the maximum value in the array itself.

3. **Finding Longest Subsegment**: The code then iterates through the array to find the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are equal to `max_a`. This is done by maintaining a temporary length `tmp` that counts the current contiguous segment of `max_a` values. When a different value is encountered, it checks if the current segment length `tmp` is greater than the previously recorded maximum length `max_len` and updates `max_len` accordingly. After the loop, it performs a final check to update `max_len` if the last segment is the longest.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the length of the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are equal to `max_a`.

The code handles all edge cases correctly:
- If the array is empty, `max_len` will remain 0, and the output will be 0.
- If there are no elements equal to `max_a`, the same logic applies, and the output will be 0.
- If there are multiple segments with the same maximum mean, it correctly finds the longest one.

Thus, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
