You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Find the subsegment a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) with maximum arithmetic mean (1)/(r - l + 1)∑_{i=l}^{r}{a_i} (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).

If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the array a.

Output

Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.

Example

Input


5
6 1 6 6 0


Output


2

Note

The subsegment [3, 4] is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    '\nmax_avg = 0\nmax_len = 0\nfor i in range(0, n):\n    for j in range(i, n):\n        tmp = sum(a[i:j+1])/float(j-i+1)\n        if tmp > max_avg:\n            max_avg = tmp\n            max_len = (j-i+1)\n        elif tmp == max_avg:\n            if (j-i+1) > max_len:\n                max_len = (j-i+1)\n'
    max_a = max(a)
    max_len = 0
    tmp = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        if a[i] != max_a:
            if tmp > max_len:
                max_len = tmp
            tmp = 0
        elif a[i] == max_a:
            tmp += 1
    if tmp > max_len:
        max_len = tmp
    print(max_len)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the longest subsegment with the maximum possible arithmetic mean. Here’s how:

1. **Identifying the Maximum Value**: The program first finds the maximum value in the array `a`. This is because the subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean will always consist of the maximum value repeated, as this will yield the highest mean.

2. **Finding the Longest Subsegment**: The program then iterates through the array to find the longest contiguous subsegment consisting of this maximum value. It keeps track of the current length of the subsegment (`tmp`) and updates the maximum length found so far (`max_len`) whenever a longer subsegment is found.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same (e.g., `[6, 6, 6, 6]`), arrays with no repeated maximum values (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), and arrays with multiple subsegments of the maximum value (e.g., `[6, 1, 6, 6, 0]`).

Given these points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly, and thus, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two lines of input: the first line is a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the second line is a space-separated list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It then processes this list to find the maximum value in the list (`max_a`) and the length of the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are equal to `max_a`. Finally, it prints the length of this longest contiguous subarray. If the list is empty or contains no elements equal to `max_a`, the function will print 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
