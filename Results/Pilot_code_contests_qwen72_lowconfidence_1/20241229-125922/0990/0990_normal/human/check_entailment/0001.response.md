Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_a` is set to the maximum value in the array `a`.
   - `max_len` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the length of the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean.
   - `tmp` is initialized to 0 to count the current length of the subsegment being considered.

2. **Iterating through the array**:
   - For each element in the array, the program checks if the element is equal to `max_a`.
   - If the element is equal to `max_a`, `tmp` is incremented to extend the current subsegment.
   - If the element is not equal to `max_a`, the current subsegment ends, and `tmp` is compared to `max_len`. If `tmp` is greater than `max_len`, `max_len` is updated to `tmp`, and `tmp` is reset to 0.

3. **Final check**:
   - After the loop, there is a final check to update `max_len` if `tmp` is greater than `max_len`.

This approach ensures that the program finds the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean, which is the highest value in the array. The program correctly handles edge cases and different input scenarios, making it correct for the given problem description.
