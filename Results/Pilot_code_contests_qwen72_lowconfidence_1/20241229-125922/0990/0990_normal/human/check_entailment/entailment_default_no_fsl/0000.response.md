Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the longest contiguous subarray with the maximum arithmetic mean. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input values as specified in the problem description. It reads `n` and the list `a`.

2. **Finding Maximum Value**: It finds the maximum value in the list `a` using `max_a = max(a)`.

3. **Finding Longest Subarray with Maximum Value**:
   - It initializes `max_len` to 0, which will store the length of the longest subarray with all elements equal to `max_a`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and uses a temporary variable `tmp` to count the length of the current contiguous subarray where all elements are equal to `max_a`.
   - If an element is not equal to `max_a`, it checks if the current subarray length `tmp` is greater than `max_len` and updates `max_len` accordingly, then resets `tmp` to 0.
   - If an element is equal to `max_a`, it increments `tmp` by 1.
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to update `max_len` in case the last subarray is the longest.

4. **Output**: The program prints `max_len`, which is the length of the longest contiguous subarray with all elements equal to `max_a`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the longest subarray with the maximum arithmetic mean, as the arithmetic mean of a subarray where all elements are equal to the maximum value is simply the maximum value itself. The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints and produces the correct output for every valid input.
