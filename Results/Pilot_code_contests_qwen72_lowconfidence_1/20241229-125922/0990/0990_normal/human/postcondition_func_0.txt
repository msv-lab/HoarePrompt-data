The function reads two lines of input: the first line is a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the second line is a space-separated list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It then processes this list to find the maximum value in the list (`max_a`) and the length of the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are equal to `max_a`. Finally, it prints the length of this longest contiguous subarray. If the list is empty or contains no elements equal to `max_a`, the function will print 0.
