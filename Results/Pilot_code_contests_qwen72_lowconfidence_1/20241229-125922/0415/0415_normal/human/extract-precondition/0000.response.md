Precondition: **delta is an integer representing the minimum number of changes required to make the sequence valid, and it is initialized to 0. However, this function definition does not match the problem description provided, as the function should take a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` as inputs, not an optional parameter `delta`.** 

For a more accurate function definition based on the problem statement, the precondition should be:

```
def min_changes_to_valid_tree(n, a):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.**
