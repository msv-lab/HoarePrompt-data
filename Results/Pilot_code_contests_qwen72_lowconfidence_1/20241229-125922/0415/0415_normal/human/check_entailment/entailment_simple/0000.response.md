Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from meeting the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Function Definition Mismatch**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined with an optional parameter `delta`, which is not mentioned in the problem description. The problem description specifies that the input should be a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The function `func_1` is used to read input, but it adds an unnecessary `delta` parameter and does not align with the expected input format.

2. **Handling of Roots**:
   - The program attempts to handle multiple roots by selecting the first root found and making all other roots point to it. However, the logic for handling the case where no root is found is incorrect. Specifically, the line `root = roots[0] if len(roots) > 0 else issues[0]` will raise an error if `roots` is empty and `issues` is also empty, because `issues[0]` will attempt to access an index that does not exist.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Changes**:
   - The calculation of the number of changes required is not entirely correct. The program attempts to count the number of changes by adding the length of `roots` and `issues`, but this approach may overcount or undercount the actual number of changes needed to form a valid tree.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is not strictly adhered to. The program should print the minimum number of changes followed by the modified sequence, but the way it handles the output might not always produce the correct format, especially if there are issues with the logic for determining the number of changes.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the input:
```
4
2 3 3 4
```

The expected output is:
```
1
2 3 4 4
```

However, the program might produce an incorrect output due to the issues mentioned above. For example, it might not correctly identify the root and the number of changes required, leading to an incorrect sequence.

### Conclusion:

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description due to the issues in input handling, root selection, and calculation of the number of changes. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
