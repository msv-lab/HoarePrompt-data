Functionality: ** The function `func_1` is intended to take an integer `delta` as a parameter, but it does not actually use this parameter effectively. Instead, it reads a space-separated string of integers from user input, converts each substring to an integer, and adds `delta` (which is always 0) to each of these integers. The function then returns a list of these modified integers. In practice, the function always returns a list of integers that are identical to the integers provided by the user, since `delta` is always 0. This means that the function effectively just parses a space-separated string of integers from user input and returns them as a list. Potential edge cases include handling non-integer inputs, which would result in a `ValueError` if the user provides invalid input. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `delta` is not 0, as it is not used in the actual computation. **
