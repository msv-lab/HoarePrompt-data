The function `func_1` is intended to accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, but the provided function definition only includes an integer `delta` which is set to 0. Based on the intended functionality, the function should process the list `a` by adding the integer `delta` (which is 0) to each element of the list. The function then returns a new list of integers where each element is the sum of the corresponding element from the input list `a` and the integer `delta`.

However, given the actual function definition provided, the function `func_1` currently only accepts a single parameter `delta`, which is an integer initialized to 0. The function returns a list of integers where each element is the sum of the corresponding integer from the user input (split by spaces) and the integer `delta` which is 0.
