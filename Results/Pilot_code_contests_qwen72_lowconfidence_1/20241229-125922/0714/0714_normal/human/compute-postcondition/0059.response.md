The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end immediately and jumps to the next iteration. This means that no further code within the loop body will be executed for this iteration. The values of `a[1]`, `j`, `i`, `prime`, and `p` remain unchanged, but the loop will proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`a[1]` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`. If `prime[j]` is `True` and `a[i] % j == 0`, `p[j]` is incremented by 1.**
