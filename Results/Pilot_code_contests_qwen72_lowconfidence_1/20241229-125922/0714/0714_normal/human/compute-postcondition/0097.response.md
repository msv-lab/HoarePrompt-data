According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit of the range, which is 10000005. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 10000005.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `i` is 2, `p[1]` is 0**
