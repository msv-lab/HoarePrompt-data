Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and `a[i] // j` is a prime number, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, and `j` is `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`. After the loop finishes, `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the same range where `a[i] // j` is a prime number.**
