To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Initial State:
- `args` is a tuple of values of any type.
- `sep` is the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '` if not.
- `file` is the value from `kwargs` if present or `sys.stdout` if not.
- `end` is a string appended after all values are written.
- `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
- `at_start` is True.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the `args` tuple.
- For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `args` must be a non-empty tuple for the loop to execute.
- `x` should be the first element in `args` at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
- `args` is a tuple of values of any type and must have at least one element.
- `sep` is the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '` if not.
- `file` is the value from `kwargs` if present or `sys.stdout` if not.
- `end` is a string appended after all values are written.
- `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
- `at_start` is True.
- `x` is the first element in `args`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`args` is a tuple of values of any type and must have at least one element, `sep` is the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '` if not, `file` is the value from `kwargs` if present or `sys.stdout` if not, `end` is a string appended after all values are written, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `at_start` is True, `x` is the first element in `args`**
