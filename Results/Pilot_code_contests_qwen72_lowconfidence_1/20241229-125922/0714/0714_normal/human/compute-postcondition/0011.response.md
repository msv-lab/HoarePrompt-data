Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of values of any type and must have at least two elements. `sep` remains the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '`. `file` remains the value from `kwargs` if present or `sys.stdout` and now contains the string representation of the first element in `args` followed by `sep` if `at_start` is False. `end` remains a string appended after all values are written. `flush` remains a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream. `at_start` remains False. `x` is the second element in `args`.***
