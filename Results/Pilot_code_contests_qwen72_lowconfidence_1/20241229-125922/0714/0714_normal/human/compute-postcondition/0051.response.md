The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables within the current iteration. However, the loop condition and the incrementation of `j` will be evaluated in the next iteration.

Output State: **`a[1]` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`. If `prime[j]` is `True` and `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[j]` is incremented by 1, and `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1 if `prime[a[i] // j]` is `True`. If `prime[j]` is `False`, `j` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.**
