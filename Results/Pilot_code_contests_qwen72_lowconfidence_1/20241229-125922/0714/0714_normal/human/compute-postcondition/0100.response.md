The value of `p[i]` is updated by adding the value of `p[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is 3, `p[3]` is updated by adding the value of `p[2]`. Since `p[2]` is 0, `p[3]` remains unchanged from its initial value, which was also 0.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `i` is 3, `p[1]` is 0, `p[2]` is 0, `p[3]` is 0**
