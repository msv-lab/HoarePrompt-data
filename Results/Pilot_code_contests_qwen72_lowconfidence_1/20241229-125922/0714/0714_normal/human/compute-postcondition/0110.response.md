The line of code `l, r = func_3()` assigns new values to `l` and `r` based on the return values of `func_3()`. Since the initial state specifies that `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and this line of code reassigns `l` and `r` using the same function, the values of `l` and `r` are updated but remain consistent with being the output of `func_3()`. 

No other variables are directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains largely unchanged except for the reassignment of `l` and `r`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005, `q` must be greater than `i + 2`, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_3()`, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005, `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` has been called, `i` is `i + 2`**
