`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object specified by `file`.

- `args` remains a tuple of values of any type and must have at least one element.
- `sep` remains the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '` if not.
- `file` remains the value from `kwargs` if present or `sys.stdout` if not.
- `end` remains a string appended after all values are written.
- `flush` remains a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
- `at_start` is still True, indicating that this is the first write operation.
- `x` is the first element in `args`, and its string representation has been written to `file`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple of values of any type and must have at least one element, `sep` is the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '`, `file` is the value from `kwargs` if present or `sys.stdout`, `end` is a string appended after all values are written, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `at_start` is True, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `file` contains the string representation of `x`.**
