The code snippet assigns new values to `l` and `r` using the function `func_3()`. Since the initial state specifies that `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, the new values of `l` and `r` after the assignment will also satisfy these conditions. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005, `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`**.
