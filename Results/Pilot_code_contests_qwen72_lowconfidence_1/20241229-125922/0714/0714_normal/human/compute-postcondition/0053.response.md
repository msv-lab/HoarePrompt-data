The given code snippet increments the value of `p[a[i] // j]` by 1. This means that the value of `p[a[i] // j]` is updated to its current value plus 1. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a[1]` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`. If `prime[j]` is `True` and `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[j]` is incremented by 1. If `prime[a[i] // j]` is `True`, `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1. If `prime[j]` is `False`, `j` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues. `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1.**
