The function `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` is called, which means the argument passed to `func_20` is the difference between the cumulative sums at indices `r` and `l - 1` of the list `p`. This call does not directly modify any of the variables in the initial state, but it does execute the function `func_20` with the specified argument.

Given that no return value or side effects of `func_20` are mentioned, we assume that this function call does not alter the state of the variables `n`, `a`, `p`, `q`, `l`, `r`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` has been called.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005, `q` must be greater than `i + 2`, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_3()`, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005, `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` has been called, `i` is `i + 2`**
