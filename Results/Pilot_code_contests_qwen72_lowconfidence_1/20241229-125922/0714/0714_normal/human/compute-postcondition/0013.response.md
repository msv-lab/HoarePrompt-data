The value of `at_start` is set to `False`. Since this value was already `False` in the initial state, no change occurs in the state of `at_start`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of values of any type and must have at least two elements, `sep` remains the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '`, `file` remains the value from `kwargs` if present or `sys.stdout` and now contains the string representation of the first element in `args` followed by `sep` if `at_start` is False, followed by the string representation of the second element in `args`, `end` remains a string appended after all values are written, `flush` remains a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `at_start` is False, `x` is the second element in `args`.**
