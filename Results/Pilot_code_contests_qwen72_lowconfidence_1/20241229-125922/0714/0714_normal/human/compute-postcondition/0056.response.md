The value of `p[j]` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`. The value of `a[1]` remains at least 1, and the loop condition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a[1]` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `p[j]` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`.**
