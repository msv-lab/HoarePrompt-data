The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file object specified by `file`. Since `at_start` is False, the `file` already contains the string representation of the first element in `args` followed by `sep` and the string representation of the second element in `args`. After executing this line, `sep` is appended to the content of `file`.

The values of `args`, `sep`, `end`, `flush`, `at_start`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of values of any type and must have at least three elements, `sep` remains the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '`, `file` now contains the string representation of the first element in `args` followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the second element in `args`, followed by another `sep`, `end` remains a string appended after all values are written, `flush` remains a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `at_start` is False, `x` is the third element in `args`**
