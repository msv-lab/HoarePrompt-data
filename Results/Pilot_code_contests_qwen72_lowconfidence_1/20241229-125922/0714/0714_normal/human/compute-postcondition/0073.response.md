The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of the loop.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `a[2]` must be a positive integer, `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[2] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and `a[2] // j` is a prime number, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `j` is 1, `prime[j]` is `True`, `a[i] % j == 0`, `p[1]` is incremented by 1, `prime[a[i] // j]` is `False`, and the current iteration is skipped.
