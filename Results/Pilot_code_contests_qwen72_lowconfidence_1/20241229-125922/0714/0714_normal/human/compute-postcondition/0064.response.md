To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i in range(n)`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the result of `func_5()`.
   - `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and `a[i] // j` is a prime number.
   - `q` is an integer.
   - `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9.
   - `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
   - `j` is `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`.

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `i`. Since `i` will be 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The values of `a`, `p`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and the fact that `func_18(10000005)` has been called remain unchanged.
   - The value of `j` will be recalculated for the new `i` (which will be 2), so `j` will be `int(sqrt(a[2])) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[2] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and `a[2] // j` is a prime number, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, and `j` is `int(sqrt(a[2])) + 1`.**
