To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is the result of `func_5()`.
- `a[2]` is a positive integer.
- `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[2] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and `a[2] // j` is a prime number.
- `q` is an integer.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9.
- `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
- `j` is 2.
- If `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[a[2] // 2]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(1, int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a[i]` is `a[2]`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - The current value of `j` is 2, and the loop will execute again if `j < int(sqrt(a[2])) + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The next value of `j` will be `j + 1`, which is 3.
   - The loop will execute again if `3 < int(sqrt(a[2])) + 1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3.
   - The condition `3 < int(sqrt(a[2])) + 1` must be true for the loop to execute again.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is the result of `func_5()`.
- `a[2]` is a positive integer.
- `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[2] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and `a[2] // j` is a prime number.
- `q` is an integer.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9.
- `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
- `j` is 3.
- If `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[a[2] // 3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `a[2]` is a positive integer, `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[2] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and `a[2] // j` is a prime number, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `j` is 3. If `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[a[2] // 3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
