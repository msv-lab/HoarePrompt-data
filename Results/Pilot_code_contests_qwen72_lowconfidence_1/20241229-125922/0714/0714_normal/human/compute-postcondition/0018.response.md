The code snippet `at_start = False` explicitly sets the variable `at_start` to `False`. Since `at_start` was already `False` according to the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The rest of the variables (`args`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`, and `x`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple of values of any type and must have at least three elements, `sep` remains the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '`, `file` now contains the string representation of the first element in `args` followed by `sep` if `at_start` is False, followed by the string representation of the second element in `args`, followed by another `sep` if `at_start` is False, followed by the string representation of the third element in `args`, `end` remains a string appended after all values are written, `flush` remains a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `at_start` is False, `x` is the third element in `args`.**
