Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of values of any type and must have at least three elements, `sep` remains the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '`, `file` now contains the string representation of the first element in `args` followed by `sep` if `at_start` is False, followed by the string representation of the second element in `args`, and followed by another `sep` if `at_start` is False, `end` remains a string appended after all values are written, `flush` remains a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `at_start` is False, `x` is the third element in `args`.***
