The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the control flow is affected.

Given the initial state:
- `a[1]` is at least 1.
- If `prime[j]` is `True` and `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[j]` is incremented by 1.
- The current value of `a[i] % j` is 0.
- `prime[a[i] // j]` is `False`.

The `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables but affects the loop control flow. The conditions and values remain the same.

Output State: **`a[1]` is at least 1, if `prime[j]` is `True` and `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[j]` is incremented by 1, the current value of `a[i] % j` is 0, `prime[a[i] // j]` is `False`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
