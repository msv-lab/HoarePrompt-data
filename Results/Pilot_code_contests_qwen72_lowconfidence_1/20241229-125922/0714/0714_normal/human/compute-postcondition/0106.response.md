To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the current state and the conditions required for the loop to continue.

### Current State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is the result of `func_5()`.
- `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9.
- `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
- `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005.
- `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` has been called.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(q):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `q`.
2. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `q` is greater than `i_prev`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i_prev + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.
- **Check `q`**: `q` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue. Therefore, `q` must be greater than `i_prev + 1`.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `a` remains the result of `func_5()`.
- `p` remains a list of cumulative sums with a length of 10000005.
- `q` must be greater than `i_prev + 1`.
- `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
- `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005.
- `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` has been called.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005, `q` must be greater than `i + 1`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005, `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` has been called, `i` is `i + 1`**
