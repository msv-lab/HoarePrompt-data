To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the effects of the loop on the variables involved. Let's break down the loop and its effects step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is the result of `func_5()`.
- `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005.
- `q` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9.
- `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
- `i` is 10000005.
- `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_3()
    func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute `q` times. If `q` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.
2. **Variable Changes**:
   - `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()` in each iteration.
   - `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` is called in each iteration.

### Output State:
- **If `q` is 0**:
  - The loop does not execute.
  - `n` remains a non-negative integer.
  - `a` remains the result of `func_5()`.
  - `p` remains a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005.
  - `q` is 0.
  - `l` and `r` retain their initial values (2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9).
  - `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
  - `i` remains 10000005.
  - `p[10000005]` remains the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005.
  - `func_20` is not called.

- **If `q` is greater than 0**:
  - The loop will execute `q` times.
  - After `q` iterations:
    - `n` remains a non-negative integer.
    - `a` remains the result of `func_5()`.
    - `p` remains a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005.
    - `q` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
    - `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration.
    - `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
    - `i` remains 10000005.
    - `p[10000005]` remains the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005.
    - `func_20` has been called `q` times with the arguments `p[r] - p[l - 1]` for each pair of `l` and `r` returned by `func_3()` in each iteration.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005, `q` is the number of iterations the loop executed, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `i` is 10000005, `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005, `func_20` has been called `q` times with the arguments `p[r] - p[l - 1]` for each pair of `l` and `r` returned by `func_3()` in each iteration.**
