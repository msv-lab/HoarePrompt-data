The value of `p[j]` is incremented by 1. Given that `j` is 3, `p[3]` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `a[2]` is a positive integer, `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[2] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and `a[2] // j` is a prime number, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `j` is 3, `p[3]` is incremented by 1.**
