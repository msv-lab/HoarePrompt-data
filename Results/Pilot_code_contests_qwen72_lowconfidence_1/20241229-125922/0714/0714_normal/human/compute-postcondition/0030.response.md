Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `a[0]` must be at least 1, `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005. If `prime[j]` is True and `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[j]` is set to 1. If `prime[a[i] // j]` is False, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[0]))` for the loop to execute one more time. If `prime[a[i] // j]` is True, `j` remains unchanged.***
