The function `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` is called, which means the expression `p[r] - p[l - 1]` is evaluated and passed to `func_20`. The values of `l` and `r` are determined by the return values of `func_3()`, and `p` is a list of cumulative sums with a length of 10000005.

Since the function `func_20` is called, the output state will reflect that this function has been invoked with the specified argument. However, without knowing the implementation of `func_20`, we cannot determine what it does or what it returns. We assume that `func_20` might modify some state or return a value, but we don't have enough information to specify the exact changes.

Therefore, the output state remains mostly unchanged, except for the fact that `func_20` has been called with the specified argument.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005, `q` must be greater than `i + 1`, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005, `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` has been called, `i` is `i + 1`**
