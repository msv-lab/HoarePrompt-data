Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005, where each `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `0` to `n-1` and for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and `a[i] // j` is a prime number. `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called.**
