The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` (which is the third element in `args`) to the file object `file`. This operation does not change the values of `args`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`, or `at_start`. However, it updates the content of `file`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of values of any type and must have at least three elements, `sep` remains the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '`, `file` now contains the string representation of the first element in `args` followed by `sep` if `at_start` is False, followed by the string representation of the second element in `args`, followed by another `sep` if `at_start` is False, followed by the string representation of the third element in `args`, `end` remains a string appended after all values are written, `flush` remains a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `at_start` is False, `x` is the third element in `args`.**
