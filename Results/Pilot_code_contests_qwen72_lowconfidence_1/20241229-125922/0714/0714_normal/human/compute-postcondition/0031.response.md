The code snippet `p[a[i] // j] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] // j` in the list `p` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `a` is the result of `func_5()`, and `a[0]` must be at least 1
- `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005
- If `prime[j]` is True and `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[j]` is set to 1
- If `prime[a[i] // j]` is False, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[0]))` for the loop to execute one more time
- If `prime[a[i] // j]` is True, `j` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet:
- The value at the index `a[i] // j` in the list `p` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 0, this means `p[a[0] // j]` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `a` is the result of `func_5()`, and `a[0]` must be at least 1
- `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005, except for the element at index `a[0] // j` which is now 1 (if it was 0 before) or incremented by 1 if it had a non-zero value before
- If `prime[j]` is True and `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[j]` is set to 1
- If `prime[a[i] // j]` is False, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[0]))` for the loop to execute one more time
- If `prime[a[i] // j]` is True, `j` remains unchanged

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the result of `func_5()` and `a[0]` is at least 1, `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005, `p[a[0] // j]` is incremented by 1, if `prime[j]` is True and `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[j]` is set to 1, if `prime[a[i] // j]` is False, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[0]))` for the loop to execute one more time, if `prime[a[i] // j]` is True, `j` remains unchanged.**
