Postcondition: ***`a[1]` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`. If `a[i] % j == 0`, and `prime[j]` is `True`, `p[j]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % j != 0`, there are no changes to `p[j]` or `p[a[i] // j]`.***
