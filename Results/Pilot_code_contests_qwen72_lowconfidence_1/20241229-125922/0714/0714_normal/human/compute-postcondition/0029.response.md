The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end prematurely and immediately jump to the next iteration of the loop. It does not alter the values of any variables directly. However, since the loop is controlled by the condition involving `j`, and `j` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[0]))` for the loop to continue, the next iteration will involve incrementing `j` by 1 (assuming this is part of the loop's logic, which is typical in such scenarios).

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `a[0]` must be at least 1, `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005. If `prime[j]` is True and `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[j]` is set to 1. `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[0]))` for the loop to execute one more time.
