To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues and how the loop variable `j` is updated.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` is the result of `func_5()`.
   - `a[2]` is a positive integer.
   - `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[2] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and `a[2] // j` is a prime number.
   - `q` is an integer.
   - `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9.
   - `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `prime[j]` is `True`.
   - If `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[1]` is incremented by 1 and `prime[a[i] // j]` is `False`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(a[2])) + 1`.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The condition `j <= int(sqrt(a[2]))` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is the result of `func_5()`.
- `a[2]` is a positive integer.
- `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[2] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and `a[2] // j` is a prime number.
- `q` is an integer.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9.
- `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
- `j` is 2.
- `prime[j]` is `True`.
- If `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[1]` is incremented by 1 and `prime[a[i] // j]` is `False`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `a[2]` is a positive integer, `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[2] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and `a[2] // j` is a prime number, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `j` is 2, `prime[j]` is `True`. If `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[1]` is incremented by 1 and `prime[a[i] // j]` is `False`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
