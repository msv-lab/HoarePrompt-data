The values of `sep` and `file` are updated based on the `kwargs` dictionary. If `sep` is present in `kwargs`, its value is assigned to `sep`; otherwise, `sep` is set to a space `' '`. Similarly, if `file` is present in `kwargs`, its value is assigned to `file`; otherwise, `file` is set to `sys.stdout`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **args is a tuple of values of any type, sep is the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '` if not, file is the value from `kwargs` if present or `sys.stdout` if not, end is a string appended after all values are written, and flush is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.**
