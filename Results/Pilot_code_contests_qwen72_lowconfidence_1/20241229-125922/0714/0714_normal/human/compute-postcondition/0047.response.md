To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `a[1]` is at least 1.
  - If `prime[j]` is `True` and `a[i] % j == 0`, then `p[j]` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `a[i] % j` is 0.
  - Additionally, if `prime[a[i] // j]` is `False`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for j in range(1, int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range.
2. **Current State**:
   - `j` is the current value of the iterator.
   - `a[i]` is the element being processed in the array `a`.
   - `p[j]` and `p[a[i] // j]` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop.

### Adjusting the State:
- **Increment `j`**: Since `j` is the loop iterator, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
- **Range Check**: The new value of `j` must still be within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`.

### Updated State:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`a[1]` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `a[i] % j` is 0, `p[j]` is incremented by 1 if `prime[j]` is `True` and `a[i] % j == 0`, and `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1 if `prime[a[i] // j]` is `True`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`.**
