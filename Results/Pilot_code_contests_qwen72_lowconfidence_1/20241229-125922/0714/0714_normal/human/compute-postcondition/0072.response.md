Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `a[2]` must be a positive integer, `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[2] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and `a[2] // j` is a prime number, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `j` is 1, `prime[j]` is `True`, `a[i] % j == 0`, and `p[1]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `prime[a[i] // j]` is `False`.***
