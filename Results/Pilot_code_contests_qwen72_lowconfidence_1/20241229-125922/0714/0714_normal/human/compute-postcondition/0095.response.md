To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is the result of `func_5()`.
- `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005.
- Each `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `0` to `n-1` and for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and is a prime number.
- `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and `a[i] // j` is a prime number.
- `q` is an integer.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9.
- `func_18(10000005)` has been called.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, 10000005):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to 10000004 (inclusive). This means `i` starts at 1 and goes up to 10000004.
- For the loop to execute, the range must be valid, which means the start value (1) must be less than or equal to the end value (10000004).

### States to Adjust:
- The loop will always execute because the range from 1 to 10000004 is valid.
- No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given state and the loop statement.

### Final State:
Since no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute, the state remains as follows:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is the result of `func_5()`.
- `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005.
- Each `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `0` to `n-1` and for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and is a prime number.
- `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and `a[i] // j` is a prime number.
- `q` is an integer.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9.
- `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
- `i` is 1 (the starting value of the loop).

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `i` is 1**
