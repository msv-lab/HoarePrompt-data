The function `func_20` is called with the argument `p[r] - p[l - 1]`. Given the initial state, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of original values with a length of 10000005, and `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. The value of `p[r] - p[l - 1]` represents the sum of elements in the list `p` from index `l` to `r-1`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_20` is not provided, we assume it processes its argument and possibly returns a value. However, without knowing what `func_20` does, we cannot determine the specific impact on the variables. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables and the fact that `func_20` has been called with the specified argument.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005, `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` has been called.**
