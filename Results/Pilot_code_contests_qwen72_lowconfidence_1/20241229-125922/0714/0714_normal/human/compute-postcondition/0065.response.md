To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the provided code snippet and the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is the result of `func_5()`.
- `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[2] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and `a[2] // j` is a prime number.
- `q` is an integer.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9.
- `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
- `j` is `int(sqrt(a[2])) + 1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(1, int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1` is greater than 1, which means `int(sqrt(a[i]))` must be at least 1.
3. **Value of `a[i]`**: Since `i` is 2, we need to ensure that `a[2]` is a positive integer. If `a[2]` is 0 or negative, `int(sqrt(a[2]))` will be 0, and the loop will not execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `a[2]` must be a positive integer to ensure that `int(sqrt(a[2]))` is at least 1.
- `i` is 2, which is already given and does not need adjustment.
- `j` should start at 1, which is already given and does not need adjustment.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the result of `func_5()` and `a[2]` must be a positive integer, `p` is a list where `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[2] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[2]` and `a[2] // j` is a prime number, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `j` is 1**.
