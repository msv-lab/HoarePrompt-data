Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of values of any type, `sep` is the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '`, `file` now contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by the value of `end` (or `'\n'`), `end` is a string appended after all values are written, `flush` is `False`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the last element in `args`, `kwargs` no longer contains `end` if it was present. If `args` is an empty tuple, `file` remains unchanged, `at_start` remains True, and `x` is undefined. Additionally, if `flush` was `True`, the stream is forcibly flushed.***
