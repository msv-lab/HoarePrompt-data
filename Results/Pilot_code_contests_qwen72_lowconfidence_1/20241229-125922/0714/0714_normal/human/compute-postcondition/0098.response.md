The code snippet `p[i] += p[i - 1]` updates the value of `p[i]` by adding the value of `p[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is 2, this means `p[2]` will be updated by adding the value of `p[1]` to it.

From the initial state:
- `p[1]` is 0.
- `p[2]` initially is 0 (as part of the list `p` initialized with zeros).

Therefore, `p[2]` will be updated to `p[2] + p[1]`, which is `0 + 0 = 0`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `i` is 2, `p[1]` is 0, `p[2]` is 0**
