The values of `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005, `q` must be greater than `i + 1`, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005, `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` has been called, `i` is `i + 1`**
