The value of `p[i]` is updated by adding the value of `p[i - 1]` to it. Since `i` is 1, `p[1]` will be updated to `p[1] + p[0]`. Given that `p` is initially a list of zeros, `p[0]` is 0, and `p[1]` is also 0. Therefore, after the operation, `p[1]` remains 0.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `func_18(10000005)`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `i` is 1, `p[1]` is 0**
