The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of elements that can be compared and sorted. It returns a new list that is the sorted version of `l` in descending order, based on the key function `getKey`. The elements in the returned list maintain their relative order as defined by the `getKey` function. If the `getKey` function is not defined or raises an exception for any element in the list, the function will raise an error. If the input list `l` is empty, the function will return an empty list.
