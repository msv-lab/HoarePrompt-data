The function `func_18` takes a positive integer `n` as input and initializes a list `prime` where `prime[1]` is set to `False`. It then iterates through integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `n`. For each integer `p` that is marked as `True` in the `prime` list, it marks all multiples of `p` (starting from `p * p`) as `False` in the `prime` list. After the function completes, the `prime` list will have `True` values for indices that are prime numbers and `False` for non-prime indices. The function does not return any value, but the side effect is the modification of the `prime` list. Note that the `prime` list is not defined within the function, which could lead to errors if it is not initialized before calling `func_18`.
