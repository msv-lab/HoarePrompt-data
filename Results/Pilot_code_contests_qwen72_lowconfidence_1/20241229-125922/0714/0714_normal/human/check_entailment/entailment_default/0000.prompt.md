You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently, the bear started studying data structures and faced the following problem.

You are given a sequence of integers x1, x2, ..., xn of length n and m queries, each of them is characterized by two integers li, ri. Let's introduce f(p) to represent the number of such indexes k, that xk is divisible by p. The answer to the query li, ri is the sum: <image>, where S(li, ri) is a set of prime numbers from segment [li, ri] (both borders are included in the segment).

Help the bear cope with the problem.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106). The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn (2 ≤ xi ≤ 107). The numbers are not necessarily distinct.

The third line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50000). Each of the following m lines contains a pair of space-separated integers, li and ri (2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·109) — the numbers that characterize the current query.

Output

Print m integers — the answers to the queries on the order the queries appear in the input.

Note

Consider the first sample. Overall, the first sample has 3 queries.

  1. The first query l = 2, r = 11 comes. You need to count f(2) + f(3) + f(5) + f(7) + f(11) = 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 9. 
  2. The second query comes l = 3, r = 12. You need to count f(3) + f(5) + f(7) + f(11) = 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 7. 
  3. The third query comes l = 4, r = 4. As this interval has no prime numbers, then the sum equals 0.

    func_19()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input and returns it. If the input is not a valid integer, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the returned value is the integer read from the standard input, assuming the input was valid.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input and returns it as a string. If no input is provided, the function will block (wait) until input is available. The function does not handle any errors or invalid input, so if the input is not correctly formatted or if there is an issue with the input stream, the behavior is undefined. After the function executes, the input provided by the user is returned, and the program state is unchanged in terms of global variables or side effects.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads a line of input from `stdin`, expecting it to be a string of space-separated integers. It then returns a map object that converts each element of the input string into an integer. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised when attempting to convert these values to integers. The function does not handle such errors, so the caller must ensure the input is correctly formatted. After the function executes, the input string is consumed, and the returned map object can be iterated over to access the converted integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input by spaces, and converts each element into a string. The function then returns a map object containing these string elements. The map object can be iterated over to access the individual strings. If the user inputs nothing or only whitespace, the function will return an empty map object.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the provided context, the exact content of the list cannot be determined. If `func_3()` raises an exception, `func_5` will also raise that exception. If `func_3()` returns an iterable other than a list, `func_5` will convert it to a list. If `func_3()` returns a non-iterable, a `TypeError` will be raised when attempting to convert it to a list.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It sets the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and increases the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread that starts the `main` function and begins the thread's execution. After the function completes, the recursion limit and stack size will be modified, and a new thread will be running the `main` function. The function itself does not wait for the thread to finish; it returns immediately after starting the thread.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a list or tuple containing at least two elements. The function returns the second element of `item`. The returned element must support comparison operations, meaning it can be compared using operators like `<`, `>`, `==`, etc. However, the function does not validate whether `item` meets these conditions; it assumes the input is correct. If `item` is not a list or tuple, or if it contains fewer than two elements, the function will raise an error. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the second element of `item` is returned, and no changes are made to the original `item`.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of elements that can be compared and sorted. It returns a new list that is the sorted version of `l` in descending order, based on the key function `getKey`. The elements in the returned list maintain their relative order as defined by the `getKey` function. If the `getKey` function is not defined or raises an exception for any element in the list, the function will raise an error. If the input list `l` is empty, the function will return an empty list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the integer `num`, and there are `n` such inner lists. The function ensures that both `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `num` is an integer. If `n` or `m` are zero, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. If `n` or `m` are negative, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error or unexpected output.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts an integer `x` and returns `False` if `x` is 0. If `x` is not 0, the function returns `True` if `x` is a power of two, and `False` otherwise. This means that for any non-zero integer `x`, the function will return `True` only if `x` is a power of two (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.). For all other non-zero integers, the function will return `False`.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. If `n` is 0, the function returns '0'. The function handles all non-negative integers correctly, converting them to their binary string representation.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from the integer `n`. If `n` is negative, the function will still return the digits of the absolute value of `n` without any sign. If `n` is zero, the function will return a list containing a single element `[0]`. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, and passing a non-integer value to the function will result in a `ValueError` or `TypeError` depending on the input type.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `n` and `r`, both of which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n. It returns the binomial coefficient C(n, r), which represents the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. The binomial coefficient is calculated as `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))`. If either `n` or `r` is negative or if `r` is greater than `n`, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the invalid input conditions for the factorial function.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, and `p` is a positive integer greater than 1. It computes and returns the result of \( x^y \mod p \). After the function executes, the state of the program is such that `y` is 0, `res` is \( x^{\text{initial value of } y} \mod p \), and `x` is a non-negative integer less than `p`. The function correctly handles edge cases where `y` is 0, returning 1 as expected.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both integers, with `y` being non-negative. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns the original value of `x`, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. After the function concludes, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. Specifically, it returns `False` for `n <= 1`, `True` for `n = 2` or `n = 3`, and `False` for any `n` that is divisible by 2 or 3. For `n > 3`, it checks if `n` is divisible by any integer of the form `6m ± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If no such divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output hints for function17:  The function `func_17` redirects the standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to a file named 'output.txt'. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, any subsequent input operations (e.g., `input()`) will read from 'input.txt', and any subsequent output operations (e.g., `print()`) will write to 'output.txt'. The function does not handle any edge cases, such as the files not existing or being inaccessible, which could result in exceptions being raised.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18(n):
    p = 2
    prime[1] = False
    while p * p <= n:
        if prime[p] == True:
            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                prime[i] = False
        p += 1
''' 

 Output hints for function18:  The function `func_18` takes a positive integer `n` as input and initializes a list `prime` where `prime[1]` is set to `False`. It then iterates through integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `n`. For each integer `p` that is marked as `True` in the `prime` list, it marks all multiples of `p` (starting from `p * p`) as `False` in the `prime` list. After the function completes, the `prime` list will have `True` values for indices that are prime numbers and `False` for non-prime indices. The function does not return any value, but the side effect is the modification of the `prime` list. Note that the `prime` list is not defined within the function, which could lead to errors if it is not initialized before calling `func_18`.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    n = func_1()

    for i in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_3()
        func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])
''' 

 Output hints for function19:  The function `func_19` processes a sequence of integers `a` and handles a series of queries defined by bounds `l` and `r`. Specifically, it performs the following actions:

1. Initializes `n` as the length of the sequence `a`, obtained from the function `func_1()`.
2. Initializes `a` as a list of integers, obtained from the function `func_5()`.
3. Creates a list `p` of length 10000005, initialized with zeros.
4. Calls the function `func_18(10000005)`, which is assumed to perform some initialization (details not provided).
5. Iterates over each element `a[i]` in the sequence `a` and for each integer `j` up to the square root of `a[i]`, it checks if `j` is a prime number and if `a[i]` is divisible by `j`. If both conditions are met, it increments `p[j]` and `p[a[i] // j]` if `a[i] // j` is also a prime number.
6. Computes the cumulative sum of the list `p`, such that each `p[i]` becomes the sum of all elements from `p[1]` to `p[i]`.
7. Initializes `q` as the number of queries, obtained from the function `func_1()`.
8. For each query, it retrieves the bounds `l` and `r` from the function `func_3()`.
9. Calls the function `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` for each query, passing the difference between the cumulative sums `p[r]` and `p[l - 1]`.

After the function concludes:
- `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the sequence `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005.
- `q` is the number of queries processed.
- `l` and `r` are the bounds of the last query processed.
- `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
- `func_20` has been called `q` times with the arguments `p[r] - p[l - 1]` for each pair of `l` and `r` returned by `func_3()` in each iteration.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `a` contains negative numbers or non-integer values, the behavior is undefined.
- If `l` or `r` are out of bounds (less than 1 or greater than 10000005), the behavior is undefined.
- If `prime` is not properly initialized or contains incorrect values, the results will be incorrect.
- If `func_18`, `func_3`, or `func_20` have side effects or dependencies, they could affect the overall state of the program.
Function number 20 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_20(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function20:  The function `func_20` prints the values provided in the `args` tuple to a specified stream (`file`), with each value separated by the string `sep`. After printing all values, it appends the string `end` (defaulting to a newline character `\n`). If the `flush` parameter is `True`, the stream is forcibly flushed. If `args` is an empty tuple, nothing is written to the stream, and `file` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the `file` stream contains the concatenated string representation of the elements in `args`, separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `flush` was `True`, the stream is guaranteed to be flushed.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
