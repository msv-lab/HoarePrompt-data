Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input values for `l` and `r` are out of bounds. According to the problem description, `l` and `r` can be as large as \(2 \times 10^9\), but the program only initializes and uses a list `p` of length 10000005. This means that if `r` is greater than 10000005, the program will raise an index out of range error when accessing `p[r]` or `p[l - 1]`. Therefore, the program does not meet the specification for all potential cases.
