You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently, the bear started studying data structures and faced the following problem.

You are given a sequence of integers x1, x2, ..., xn of length n and m queries, each of them is characterized by two integers li, ri. Let's introduce f(p) to represent the number of such indexes k, that xk is divisible by p. The answer to the query li, ri is the sum: <image>, where S(li, ri) is a set of prime numbers from segment [li, ri] (both borders are included in the segment).

Help the bear cope with the problem.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106). The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn (2 ≤ xi ≤ 107). The numbers are not necessarily distinct.

The third line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50000). Each of the following m lines contains a pair of space-separated integers, li and ri (2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·109) — the numbers that characterize the current query.

Output

Print m integers — the answers to the queries on the order the queries appear in the input.

Note

Consider the first sample. Overall, the first sample has 3 queries.

  1. The first query l = 2, r = 11 comes. You need to count f(2) + f(3) + f(5) + f(7) + f(11) = 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 9. 
  2. The second query comes l = 3, r = 12. You need to count f(3) + f(5) + f(7) + f(11) = 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 7. 
  3. The third query comes l = 4, r = 4. As this interval has no prime numbers, then the sum equals 0.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in every potential case:

1. **Prime Sieve Initialization**: The `func_18` function initializes a sieve to mark non-prime numbers up to 10,000,005. However, the `prime` array is never defined or initialized before calling `func_18`. This will cause a runtime error because the `prime` array is used without being properly initialized.

2. **Handling Large Prime Numbers**: The problem statement specifies that the queries can involve large ranges up to \(2 \times 10^9\). The program only precomputes primes up to 10,000,005, which means it will not handle prime numbers larger than this limit correctly. For example, if a query involves a range that includes a prime number greater than 10,000,005, the program will not be able to handle it.

3. **Divisibility Check**: In the `func_19` function, the loop that checks divisibility and updates the `p` array has a logical issue. The inner loop iterates over `j` from 1 to the square root of `a[i]`, but it should start from 2 to ensure it only checks prime numbers. Additionally, the check `if prime[a[i] // j] == False` is redundant and can be removed.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases where the input values are at the boundaries of the specified ranges. For example, if the input sequence contains very large numbers close to \(10^7\) and the queries involve large ranges, the program may not handle these cases correctly due to the limitations mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
