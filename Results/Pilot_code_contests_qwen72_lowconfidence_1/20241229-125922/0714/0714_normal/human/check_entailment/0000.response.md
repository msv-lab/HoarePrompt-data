Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Prime Number Sieve Initialization**: The `prime` list, which is supposed to store the primality of numbers, is not initialized before being used in the `func_18` function. This will lead to errors when accessing `prime[j]` and `prime[a[i] // j]`.

2. **Handling of Divisors**: In the `func_19` function, the loop that checks divisors of `a[i]` only iterates up to `int(sqrt(a[i]))`. This means that if `a[i]` is a perfect square, its square root will be checked, but the corresponding divisor `a[i] // j` might not be a prime number, leading to incorrect counts.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where the input values for `l` and `r` are very large (up to \(2 \times 10^9\)). The `p` array is only sized up to 10,000,005, which is insufficient for the upper bound of \(2 \times 10^9\).

4. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The cumulative sum calculation in the `p` array assumes that all indices up to 10,000,005 are valid, which may not be the case if the input values for `l` and `r` exceed this range.

Given these issues, the program will fail to produce the correct output for certain inputs, particularly those involving large values of `l` and `r` or specific edge cases in the input data. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
