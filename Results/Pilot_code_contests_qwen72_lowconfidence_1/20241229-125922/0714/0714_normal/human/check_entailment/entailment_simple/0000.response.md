Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program provided appears to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the length of the sequence `n` and the sequence itself `a` using `func_1()` and `func_5()`, respectively.
   - It then reads the number of queries `q` using `func_1()`.
   - For each query, it reads the range `[l, r]` using `func_3()`.

2. **Prime Number Sieve:**
   - The function `func_18(n)` implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes to mark all non-prime numbers up to 10,000,005. This ensures that the `prime` array correctly identifies prime numbers.

3. **Counting Divisors:**
   - The program iterates over the sequence `a` and for each element, it counts the number of times it is divisible by each prime number up to its square root. This is done using nested loops and the `prime` array.
   - The results are stored in the `p` array, where `p[j]` represents the number of elements in `a` that are divisible by the prime number `j`.

4. **Cumulative Sum:**
   - The program computes the cumulative sum of the `p` array to allow efficient range queries. This is done using a simple loop where each element in `p` is added to the sum of the previous elements.

5. **Answering Queries:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the number of divisors for all prime numbers in the range `[l, r]` using the cumulative sum array `p`.
   - The result is printed using `func_20()`.

### Why the Program is Correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input as specified in the problem description. It reads the sequence length `n`, the sequence `a`, the number of queries `q`, and the query ranges `[l, r]`.

2. **Prime Number Identification:**
   - The Sieve of Eratosthenes is correctly implemented to identify prime numbers up to 10,000,005. This ensures that the program can efficiently check if a number is prime.

3. **Divisor Counting:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of times each element in the sequence `a` is divisible by each prime number. This is done by iterating over the sequence and checking divisibility for each prime number up to the square root of the element.

4. **Efficient Range Queries:**
   - The use of a cumulative sum array allows the program to efficiently answer range queries in constant time. This is crucial for handling up to 50,000 queries efficiently.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results of the queries as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles the input and output as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
