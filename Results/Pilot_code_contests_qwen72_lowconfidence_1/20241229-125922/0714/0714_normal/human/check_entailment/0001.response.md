Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in every potential case:

1. **Prime Sieve Initialization**: The `func_18` function initializes a sieve to mark non-prime numbers up to 10,000,005. However, the `prime` array is never defined or initialized before calling `func_18`. This will cause a runtime error because the `prime` array is used without being properly initialized.

2. **Handling Large Prime Numbers**: The problem statement specifies that the queries can involve large ranges up to \(2 \times 10^9\). The program only precomputes primes up to 10,000,005, which means it will not handle prime numbers larger than this limit correctly. For example, if a query involves a range that includes a prime number greater than 10,000,005, the program will not be able to handle it.

3. **Divisibility Check**: In the `func_19` function, the loop that checks divisibility and updates the `p` array has a logical issue. The inner loop iterates over `j` from 1 to the square root of `a[i]`, but it should start from 2 to ensure it only checks prime numbers. Additionally, the check `if prime[a[i] // j] == False` is redundant and can be removed.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases where the input values are at the boundaries of the specified ranges. For example, if the input sequence contains very large numbers close to \(10^7\) and the queries involve large ranges, the program may not handle these cases correctly due to the limitations mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
