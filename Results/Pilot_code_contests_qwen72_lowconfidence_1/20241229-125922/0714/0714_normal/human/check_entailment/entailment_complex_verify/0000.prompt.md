You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently, the bear started studying data structures and faced the following problem.

You are given a sequence of integers x1, x2, ..., xn of length n and m queries, each of them is characterized by two integers li, ri. Let's introduce f(p) to represent the number of such indexes k, that xk is divisible by p. The answer to the query li, ri is the sum: <image>, where S(li, ri) is a set of prime numbers from segment [li, ri] (both borders are included in the segment).

Help the bear cope with the problem.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106). The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn (2 ≤ xi ≤ 107). The numbers are not necessarily distinct.

The third line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50000). Each of the following m lines contains a pair of space-separated integers, li and ri (2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·109) — the numbers that characterize the current query.

Output

Print m integers — the answers to the queries on the order the queries appear in the input.

Note

Consider the first sample. Overall, the first sample has 3 queries.

  1. The first query l = 2, r = 11 comes. You need to count f(2) + f(3) + f(5) + f(7) + f(11) = 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 9. 
  2. The second query comes l = 3, r = 12. You need to count f(3) + f(5) + f(7) + f(11) = 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 7. 
  3. The third query comes l = 4, r = 4. As this interval has no prime numbers, then the sum equals 0.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Prime Number Sieve Initialization**: The `prime` list, which is supposed to store the primality of numbers, is not initialized before being used in the `func_18` function. This will lead to errors when accessing `prime[j]` and `prime[a[i] // j]`.

2. **Handling of Divisors**: In the `func_19` function, the loop that checks divisors of `a[i]` only iterates up to `int(sqrt(a[i]))`. This means that if `a[i]` is a perfect square, its square root will be checked, but the corresponding divisor `a[i] // j` might not be a prime number, leading to incorrect counts.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where the input values for `l` and `r` are very large (up to \(2 \times 10^9\)). The `p` array is only sized up to 10,000,005, which is insufficient for the upper bound of \(2 \times 10^9\).

4. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The cumulative sum calculation in the `p` array assumes that all indices up to 10,000,005 are valid, which may not be the case if the input values for `l` and `r` exceed this range.

Given these issues, the program will fail to produce the correct output for certain inputs, particularly those involving large values of `l` and `r` or specific edge cases in the input data. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters. It reads an integer from the standard input, which should be a valid integer.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer read from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input and returns it. If the input is not a valid integer, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the returned value is the integer read from the standard input, assuming the input was valid.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters, and it is expected to read input from the standard input, which should be available and correctly formatted according to the problem's input specification.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided through the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input and returns it as a string. If no input is provided, the function will block (wait) until input is available. The function does not handle any errors or invalid input, so if the input is not correctly formatted or if there is an issue with the input stream, the behavior is undefined. After the function executes, the input provided by the user is returned, and the program state is unchanged in terms of global variables or side effects.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed into the function, and it is expected to read input from stdin which should be formatted as a string of space-separated integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element of the input string, which consists of space-separated integers, into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from `stdin`, expecting it to be a string of space-separated integers. It then returns a map object that converts each element of the input string into an integer. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised when attempting to convert these values to integers. The function does not handle such errors, so the caller must ensure the input is correctly formatted. After the function executes, the input string is consumed, and the returned map object can be iterated over to access the converted integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as parameters to the function `func_4`. This function is used to read input from the user, typically for parsing the input into a list of strings.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing the elements from the user's input, split by spaces and converted to strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input by spaces, and converts each element into a string. The function then returns a map object containing these string elements. The map object can be iterated over to access the individual strings. If the user inputs nothing or only whitespace, the function will return an empty map object.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, thus there are no preconditions related to input variables.
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the provided context, the exact content of the list cannot be determined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the provided context, the exact content of the list cannot be determined. If `func_3()` raises an exception, `func_5` will also raise that exception. If `func_3()` returns an iterable other than a list, `func_5` will convert it to a list. If `func_3()` returns a non-iterable, a `TypeError` will be raised when attempting to convert it to a list.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters and therefore has no preconditions related to input variables.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It sets the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and increases the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread that starts the `main` function and begins the thread's execution. After the function completes, the recursion limit and stack size will be modified, and a new thread will be running the `main` function. The function itself does not wait for the thread to finish; it returns immediately after starting the thread.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a list or tuple with at least two elements, and the second element is comparable (i.e., supports comparison operations).
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the second element of the list or tuple 'item', which is comparable (i.e., supports comparison operations).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a list or tuple containing at least two elements. The function returns the second element of `item`. The returned element must support comparison operations, meaning it can be compared using operators like `<`, `>`, `==`, etc. However, the function does not validate whether `item` meets these conditions; it assumes the input is correct. If `item` is not a list or tuple, or if it contains fewer than two elements, the function will raise an error. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the second element of `item` is returned, and no changes are made to the original `item`.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of elements that can be compared and sorted.
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a new list that is the sorted version of list `l` in descending order, based on the key function `getKey`. The elements in the returned list maintain their relative order as defined by the `getKey` function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of elements that can be compared and sorted. It returns a new list that is the sorted version of `l` in descending order, based on the key function `getKey`. The elements in the returned list maintain their relative order as defined by the `getKey` function. If the `getKey` function is not defined or raises an exception for any element in the list, the function will raise an error. If the input list `l` is empty, the function will return an empty list.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, and num is an integer.
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of lists where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the integer `num`, and there are `n` such inner lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the integer `num`, and there are `n` such inner lists. The function ensures that both `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `num` is an integer. If `n` or `m` are zero, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. If `n` or `m` are negative, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error or unexpected output.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer.
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns False if x is 0, otherwise it returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts an integer `x` and returns `False` if `x` is 0. If `x` is not 0, the function returns `True` if `x` is a power of two, and `False` otherwise. This means that for any non-zero integer `x`, the function will return `True` only if `x` is a power of two (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.). For all other non-zero integers, the function will return `False`.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, where `n` is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. If `n` is 0, the function returns '0'. The function handles all non-negative integers correctly, converting them to their binary string representation.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from the integer `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from the integer `n`. If `n` is negative, the function will still return the digits of the absolute value of `n` without any sign. If `n` is zero, the function will return a list containing a single element `[0]`. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, and passing a non-integer value to the function will result in a `ValueError` or `TypeError` depending on the input type.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n.
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))
    #The program returns the binomial coefficient C(n, r), which is the number of ways to choose r elements from a set of n elements without regard to the order of selection. This value is calculated as factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r)), where n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `n` and `r`, both of which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n. It returns the binomial coefficient C(n, r), which represents the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. The binomial coefficient is calculated as `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))`. If either `n` or `r` is negative or if `r` is greater than `n`, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the invalid input conditions for the factorial function.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, and p is a positive integer greater than 1.
def func_14(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `res` is \( x^{\text{initial value of } y} \mod p \), `x` is a non-negative integer less than `p`
    return res
    #The program returns 1, since `res` is calculated as \( x^{0} \mod p \) which equals 1 for any non-negative integer `x` less than `p`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, and `p` is a positive integer greater than 1. It computes and returns the result of \( x^y \mod p \). After the function executes, the state of the program is such that `y` is 0, `res` is \( x^{\text{initial value of } y} \mod p \), and `x` is a non-negative integer less than `p`. The function correctly handles edge cases where `y` is 0, returning 1 as expected.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, and y is non-negative.
def func_15(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0. Since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, the program returns the original value of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both integers, with `y` being non-negative. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns the original value of `x`, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. After the function concludes, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_16(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False

    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. Specifically, it returns `False` for `n <= 1`, `True` for `n = 2` or `n = 3`, and `False` for any `n` that is divisible by 2 or 3. For `n > 3`, it checks if `n` is divisible by any integer of the form `6m ± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If no such divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number.

#Function 17:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is used to redirect standard input and output to files 'input.txt' and 'output.txt', respectively.
def func_17():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` redirects the standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to a file named 'output.txt'. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, any subsequent input operations (e.g., `input()`) will read from 'input.txt', and any subsequent output operations (e.g., `print()`) will write to 'output.txt'. The function does not handle any edge cases, such as the files not existing or being inaccessible, which could result in exceptions being raised.

#Function 18:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_18(n):
    p = 2
    prime[1] = False
    while p * p <= n:
        if prime[p] == True:
            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                prime[i] = False
        
        p += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is the smallest integer such that \( p \times p > n \), `prime[1]` is `False`. For each integer `q` where \( 2 \leq q < p \), if `prime[q]` was `True` at the start of the loop, then `prime[i]` is `False` for all multiples of `q` (i.e., \( q \times q, q \times (q + 1), \ldots, \) up to the largest multiple of `q` less than or equal to `n`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` takes a positive integer `n` as input and initializes a list `prime` where `prime[1]` is set to `False`. It then iterates through integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `n`. For each integer `p` that is marked as `True` in the `prime` list, it marks all multiples of `p` (starting from `p * p`) as `False` in the `prime` list. After the function completes, the `prime` list will have `True` values for indices that are prime numbers and `False` for non-prime indices. The function does not return any value, but the side effect is the modification of the `prime` list. Note that the `prime` list is not defined within the function, which could lead to errors if it is not initialized before calling `func_18`.

#Function 19:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No specific variables are passed to the function `func_19()`. However, it internally uses `n`, `a`, `p`, `l`, `r`, and `q` which are expected to be defined or calculated through other functions (`func_1()`, `func_5()`, `func_18()`, `func_3()`, and `func_20()`) within the program. Specifically, `n` is expected to be an integer representing the length of the sequence `a`, which is a list of integers. `p` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of 10000005. `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, and `l` and `r` are the bounds of the current query, expected to be integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_19():
    n = func_1()
    a = func_5()
    p = [0] * 10000005
    func_18(10000005)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, int(sqrt(a[i])) + 1):
            if prime[j] == True:
                if a[i] % j == 0:
                    p[j] += 1
            if a[i] % j == 0:
                if prime[a[i] // j] == False:
                    continue
                p[a[i] // j] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of zeros with a length of 10000005, where each `p[j]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `0` to `n-1` and for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and is a prime number, and `p[a[i] // j]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` that is a divisor of `a[i]` and `a[i] // j` is a prime number. `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
    for i in range(1, 10000005):
        p[i] += p[i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005, `q` is an integer, `l` and `r` are integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `i` is 10000005, `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005.
    q = func_1()
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_3()
        
        func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005, `q` is the number of iterations the loop executed, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration, `func_18(10000005)` has been called, `i` is 10000005, `p[10000005]` is the sum of all the original values in `p` from index 1 to 10000005, `func_20` has been called `q` times with the arguments `p[r] - p[l - 1]` for each pair of `l` and `r` returned by `func_3()` in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` processes a sequence of integers `a` and handles a series of queries defined by bounds `l` and `r`. Specifically, it performs the following actions:

1. Initializes `n` as the length of the sequence `a`, obtained from the function `func_1()`.
2. Initializes `a` as a list of integers, obtained from the function `func_5()`.
3. Creates a list `p` of length 10000005, initialized with zeros.
4. Calls the function `func_18(10000005)`, which is assumed to perform some initialization (details not provided).
5. Iterates over each element `a[i]` in the sequence `a` and for each integer `j` up to the square root of `a[i]`, it checks if `j` is a prime number and if `a[i]` is divisible by `j`. If both conditions are met, it increments `p[j]` and `p[a[i] // j]` if `a[i] // j` is also a prime number.
6. Computes the cumulative sum of the list `p`, such that each `p[i]` becomes the sum of all elements from `p[1]` to `p[i]`.
7. Initializes `q` as the number of queries, obtained from the function `func_1()`.
8. For each query, it retrieves the bounds `l` and `r` from the function `func_3()`.
9. Calls the function `func_20(p[r] - p[l - 1])` for each query, passing the difference between the cumulative sums `p[r]` and `p[l - 1]`.

After the function concludes:
- `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the sequence `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the original values of `p` with a length of 10000005.
- `q` is the number of queries processed.
- `l` and `r` are the bounds of the last query processed.
- `func_18(10000005)` has been called.
- `func_20` has been called `q` times with the arguments `p[r] - p[l - 1]` for each pair of `l` and `r` returned by `func_3()` in each iteration.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `a` contains negative numbers or non-integer values, the behavior is undefined.
- If `l` or `r` are out of bounds (less than 1 or greater than 10000005), the behavior is undefined.
- If `prime` is not properly initialized or contains incorrect values, the results will be incorrect.
- If `func_18`, `func_3`, or `func_20` have side effects or dependencies, they could affect the overall state of the program.

#Function 20:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of values of any type, sep is a string used to separate the values, file is a stream object with a write method, end is a string appended after all values are written, and flush is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
def func_20():

If `args` is an empty tuple, `file` remains unchanged, `at_start` remains True, and `x` is undefined.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of values of any type, `sep` is the value from `kwargs` if present or `' '`, `file` now contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by the value of `end` (or `'\n'`), `end` is a string appended after all values are written, `flush` is `False`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the last element in `args`, `kwargs` no longer contains `end` if it was present. If `args` is an empty tuple, `file` remains unchanged, `at_start` remains True, and `x` is undefined. Additionally, if `flush` was `True`, the stream is forcibly flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` prints the values provided in the `args` tuple to a specified stream (`file`), with each value separated by the string `sep`. After printing all values, it appends the string `end` (defaulting to a newline character `\n`). If the `flush` parameter is `True`, the stream is forcibly flushed. If `args` is an empty tuple, nothing is written to the stream, and `file` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the `file` stream contains the concatenated string representation of the elements in `args`, separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `flush` was `True`, the stream is guaranteed to be flushed.
