The function `func_16` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. Specifically, it returns `False` for `n <= 1`, `True` for `n = 2` or `n = 3`, and `False` for any `n` that is divisible by 2 or 3. For `n > 3`, it checks if `n` is divisible by any integer of the form `6m Â± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If no such divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number.
