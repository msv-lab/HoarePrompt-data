The function `func_17` redirects the standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to a file named 'output.txt'. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, any subsequent input operations (e.g., `input()`) will read from 'input.txt', and any subsequent output operations (e.g., `print()`) will write to 'output.txt'. The function does not handle any edge cases, such as the files not existing or being inaccessible, which could result in exceptions being raised.
