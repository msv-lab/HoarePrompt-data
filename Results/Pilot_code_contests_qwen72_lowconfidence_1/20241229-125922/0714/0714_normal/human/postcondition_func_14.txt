The function `func_15` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both integers, with `y` being non-negative. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns the original value of `x`, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. After the function concludes, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.
