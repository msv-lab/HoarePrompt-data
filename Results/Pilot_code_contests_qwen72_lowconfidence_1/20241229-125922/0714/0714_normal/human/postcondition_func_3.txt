The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input by spaces, and converts each element into a string. The function then returns a map object containing these string elements. The map object can be iterated over to access the individual strings. If the user inputs nothing or only whitespace, the function will return an empty map object.
