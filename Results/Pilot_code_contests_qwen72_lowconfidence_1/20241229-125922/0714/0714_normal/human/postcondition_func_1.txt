The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input and returns it as a string. If no input is provided, the function will block (wait) until input is available. The function does not handle any errors or invalid input, so if the input is not correctly formatted or if there is an issue with the input stream, the behavior is undefined. After the function executes, the input provided by the user is returned, and the program state is unchanged in terms of global variables or side effects.
