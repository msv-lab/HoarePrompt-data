No specific variables are passed to the function `func_19()`. However, it internally uses `n`, `a`, `p`, `l`, `r`, and `q` which are expected to be defined or calculated through other functions (`func_1()`, `func_5()`, `func_18()`, `func_3()`, and `func_20()`) within the program. Specifically, `n` is expected to be an integer representing the length of the sequence `a`, which is a list of integers. `p` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of 10000005. `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, and `l` and `r` are the bounds of the current query, expected to be integers such that 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·10^9.
