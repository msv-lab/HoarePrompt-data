The function `func_3` reads a line of input from `stdin`, expecting it to be a string of space-separated integers. It then returns a map object that converts each element of the input string into an integer. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised when attempting to convert these values to integers. The function does not handle such errors, so the caller must ensure the input is correctly formatted. After the function executes, the input string is consumed, and the returned map object can be iterated over to access the converted integers.
