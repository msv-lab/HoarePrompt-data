The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the integer `num`, and there are `n` such inner lists. The function ensures that both `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `num` is an integer. If `n` or `m` are zero, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. If `n` or `m` are negative, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error or unexpected output.
