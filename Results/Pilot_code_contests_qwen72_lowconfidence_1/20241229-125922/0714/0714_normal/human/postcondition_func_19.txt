The function `func_20` prints the values provided in the `args` tuple to a specified stream (`file`), with each value separated by the string `sep`. After printing all values, it appends the string `end` (defaulting to a newline character `\n`). If the `flush` parameter is `True`, the stream is forcibly flushed. If `args` is an empty tuple, nothing is written to the stream, and `file` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the `file` stream contains the concatenated string representation of the elements in `args`, separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `flush` was `True`, the stream is guaranteed to be flushed.
