The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `n` and `r`, both of which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n. It returns the binomial coefficient C(n, r), which represents the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. The binomial coefficient is calculated as `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))`. If either `n` or `r` is negative or if `r` is greater than `n`, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the invalid input conditions for the factorial function.
