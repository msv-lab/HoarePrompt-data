The function `func_14` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, and `p` is a positive integer greater than 1. It computes and returns the result of \( x^y \mod p \). After the function executes, the state of the program is such that `y` is 0, `res` is \( x^{\text{initial value of } y} \mod p \), and `x` is a non-negative integer less than `p`. The function correctly handles edge cases where `y` is 0, returning 1 as expected.
