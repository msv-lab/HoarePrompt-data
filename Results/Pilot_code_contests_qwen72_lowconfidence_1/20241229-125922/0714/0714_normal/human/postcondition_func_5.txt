The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It sets the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and increases the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread that starts the `main` function and begins the thread's execution. After the function completes, the recursion limit and stack size will be modified, and a new thread will be running the `main` function. The function itself does not wait for the thread to finish; it returns immediately after starting the thread.
