#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and computes a specific value based on the inputs. It accepts no explicit parameters but expects the input to be provided in a specific format. The input consists of several lines, where the first line contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), the second line contains a list of `n` integers `c` (0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100), the third line contains a list of `n-1` integers `b` (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100), and the fourth line contains an integer `x` (-10^5 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^5). The function computes and prints a single integer, which is the result of a dynamic programming algorithm that calculates the number of valid configurations of `c` and `b` that satisfy certain conditions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The final state of the program includes the following: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `c` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, `b` is a list of `n-1` integers where 0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100, `x` is an integer, `prefb` is a list of prefix sums of `b` with an additional `0` appended, `prefbt` is a list of weighted prefix sums of `b` with an additional `0` appended, `sc` is the sum of all elements in `c`, `d` is a 2D list used for dynamic programming, and `ds` is a 2D list used for cumulative sums. The function prints the result of `d[0][0] % (10^9 + 7)`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 2 or less, which results in `prefbt` being `[0, 0]`.
