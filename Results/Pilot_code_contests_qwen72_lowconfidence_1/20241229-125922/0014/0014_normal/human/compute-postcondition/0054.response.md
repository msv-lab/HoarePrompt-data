To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop can start and continue executing.

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `pref` from 1 to `sc + 1` (inclusive).
   - This means `sc` must be a non-negative integer (since `range(1, sc + 2)` would be an empty range if `sc` were negative).

2. **Initial State**:
   - `minpref` is defined as the smallest integer such that \(\frac{minpref - (n - 1) \cdot prefb[n - 2] + prefbt[n - 2]}{n} \geq x\).
   - `index` is \(n - 1\).
   - `sc` is a non-negative integer.
   - `d[index][pref]` is defined based on the condition involving `min(pref + c[index] + 1, sc + 1)` and `max(minpref, pref)`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `sc` must be at least 0 (non-negative).
   - `pref` starts at 1 and goes up to `sc + 1`, so `sc + 1` must be at least 1, which is always true if `sc` is non-negative.

### Adjusted State:

- `minpref` remains as defined.
- `index` remains as \(n - 1\).
- `sc` must be a non-negative integer.
- `pref` starts at 1 and will iterate up to `sc + 1`.

### Final State:

State: **`minpref` is the smallest integer such that \(\frac{minpref - (n - 1) \cdot prefb[n - 2] + prefbt[n - 2]}{n} \geq x\), `index` is \(n - 1\), `sc` is a non-negative integer, `pref` is 1**.
