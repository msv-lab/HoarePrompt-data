The value of `minpref` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `minpref` was 2, so the new value of `minpref` is 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`minpref` is 3, `index` is \(n - 2\), `sc` remains a non-negative integer, `ds[index][pref]` for each `pref` from 1 to `sc + 1` is updated to \((ds[index][pref - 1] + d[index][pref - 1]) \% mo\), and `prefbt[n - 3]` must be such that \(\frac{2 - (n - 2) \cdot prefb[n - 3] + prefbt[n - 3]}{n - 1} < x\) holds true**
