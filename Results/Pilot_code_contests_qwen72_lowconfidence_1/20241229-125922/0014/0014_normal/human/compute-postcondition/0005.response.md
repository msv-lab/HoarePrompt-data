The given code snippet is:

```python
b = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program, step by step:

1. **`le.pop()`**: This removes the last element from the list `le` and returns it.
2. **`.split()`**: The returned string is split into a list of substrings based on whitespace.
3. **`map(int, ...)`**: Each substring is converted to an integer.
4. **`list(...)`**: The resulting map object is converted to a list.

### Initial State:
- `n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\).
- `b` is a list of `n-1` integers where \(0 \leq b_i \leq 100\).
- `q` is 1.
- `x` is a list of `q` integers where \(-10^5 \leq x_i \leq 10^5\).
- `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last element.
- `mo` is 1000000007.
- The condition (1) is always true.

### Impact of the Code:
- The last element of `le` is removed, so `le` now contains one fewer element.
- The new list `b` is assigned the values obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop.

### Updated Values:
- `b` is now a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop.
- The last element of `le` is removed, so `le` is now a list of reversed input lines minus the last two elements.

### Output State:
**`n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop, `q` is 1, `x` is a list of `q` integers where \(-10^5 \leq x_i \leq 10^5\), `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last two elements, `mo` is 1000000007, the condition (1) is always true.**
