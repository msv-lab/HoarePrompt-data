According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `index` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is `n - 1`, and `ds[index][pref]` for each `pref` from 1 to `sc + 1` is updated.

For the loop to execute one more time, `index` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the new state should reflect this change in `index`.

State: **`minpref` remains the same, `index` is \(n - 2\), `sc` remains a non-negative integer, `ds[index][pref]` for each `pref` from 1 to `sc + 1` is updated to \((ds[index][pref - 1] + d[index][pref - 1]) \% mo\)**.
