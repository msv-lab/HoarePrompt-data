The value of `minpref` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`minpref` is 2, `index` is \(n - 2\), `sc` remains a non-negative integer, `ds[index][pref]` for each `pref` from 1 to `sc + 1` is updated to \((ds[index][pref - 1] + d[index][pref - 1]) \% mo\), and `prefbt[n - 3]` must be less than \(x \cdot (n - 1) + (n - 2) \cdot prefb[n - 3]\)**
