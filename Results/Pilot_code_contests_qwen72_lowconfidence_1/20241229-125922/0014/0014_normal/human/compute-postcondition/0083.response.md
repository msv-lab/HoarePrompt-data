To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `minpref` is the smallest integer \( k \) such that \( k \geq x \cdot (n - 1) + (n - 2) \cdot \text{prefb}[n - 3] - \text{prefbt}[n - 3] \).
- `index` is \( n - 2 \).
- `sc` is a non-negative integer.
- `ds[index][pref]` for each `pref` from 1 to `sc + 1` is updated to \((ds[index][pref - 1] + d[index][pref - 1]) \% mo\).
- `d[index][pref]` for each `pref` from 0 to `sc` is updated such that `d[index][pref]` is 0 if `min(pref + c[index] + 1, sc + 1) < max(minpref, pref)` else `d[index][pref]` is `ds[index + 1][min(pref + c[index] + 1, sc + 1)] - ds[index + 1][max(minpref, pref)]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for pref in range(1, sc + 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `pref`**: The loop iterates over `pref` from 1 to `sc + 1` (inclusive). This means `sc + 2` should be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
2. **Condition for `sc`**: For the loop to execute, `sc + 2` must be greater than 1, which simplifies to `sc` being at least 0. Since `sc` is already stated as a non-negative integer, this condition is satisfied.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `sc` is at least 0.
- Ensure `minpref` is correctly calculated based on the given formula.
- Ensure `index` is set to \( n - 2 \).
- Ensure `ds[index][pref]` and `d[index][pref]` are correctly initialized and updated according to the given rules.

### Final State:
State: **`minpref` is the smallest integer \( k \) such that \( k \geq x \cdot (n - 1) + (n - 2) \cdot \text{prefb}[n - 3] - \text{prefbt}[n - 3] \), `index` is \( n - 2 \), `sc` is a non-negative integer, `ds[index][pref]` for each `pref` from 1 to `sc + 1` is updated to \((ds[index][pref - 1] + d[index][pref - 1]) \% mo\), `d[index][pref]` for each `pref` from 0 to `sc` is updated such that `d[index][pref]` is 0 if `min(pref + c[index] + 1, sc + 1) < max(minpref, pref)` else `d[index][pref]` is `ds[index + 1][min(pref + c[index] + 1, sc + 1)] - ds[index + 1][max(minpref, pref)]`, `pref` is 1**.
