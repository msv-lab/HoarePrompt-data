The code appends a new value to the list `prefbt`. This new value is calculated as `k * b[k] + prefbt[-1]`.

Given:
- `k` is 3
- `b` is a list of integers
- `prefbt` is initially `[0, b[1], 2 * b[2] + b[1]]`

The new value added to `prefbt` is:
- `k * b[k] + prefbt[-1]`
- `3 * b[3] + (2 * b[2] + b[1])`

Therefore, the new value appended to `prefbt` is `3 * b[3] + 2 * b[2] + b[1]`.

The updated `prefbt` will be:
- `prefbt = [0, b[1], 2 * b[2] + b[1], 3 * b[3] + 2 * b[2] + b[1]]`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 3, `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop, `q` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements, `mo` is 1000000007, `prefb` is a list of prefix sums of `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements of `b` up to that index, followed by an additional element `0`, `b` must have at least one element, `prefbt` is `[0, b[1], 2 * b[2] + b[1], 3 * b[3] + 2 * b[2] + b[1]]`**
