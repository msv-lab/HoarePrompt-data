The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `c`: a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
- `b`: a list of `n-1` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100.
- `q`: an integer equal to 1.
- `x`: a list of `q` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies -10^5 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^5.

The function does not explicitly return any value based on the given information. However, typically in such scenarios, the function might perform some operations based on these inputs and return a result. Since the specific return value is not provided, we can only describe the parameters accepted by the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `c`, `b`, `q`, and `x`, where `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `c` is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100), `b` is a list of `n-1` integers (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100), `q` is an integer equal to 1, and `x` is a list of `q` integers (-10^5 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^5).**
