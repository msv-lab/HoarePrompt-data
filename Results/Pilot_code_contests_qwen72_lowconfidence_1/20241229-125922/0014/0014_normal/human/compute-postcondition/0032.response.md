To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the provided state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\).
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop.
- `q` is 1.
- `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop.
- `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements.
- `mo` is 1000000007.
- `prefb` is a list of prefix sums of `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements of `b` up to that index, followed by an additional element `0`.
- `b` must have at least one element.
- `prefbt` is a list where `prefbt[i] = i * b[i] + prefbt[i-1]` for \(1 \leq i < n - 1\) and `prefbt[0] = 0`, with an additional `0` appended to its end. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, `prefbt` is `[0, 0]`.
- `sc` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
- `d` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (sc + 1)\) initialized to 0, with the last row being `[1] * (sc + 1)`.
- `ds` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (sc + 2)\) initialized to 0, with the last row being `list(range(sc + 2))`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for index in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, which means it starts at `n - 1` and decrements until it reaches `-1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`, which simplifies to `n >= 1`.
- However, given the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `n` is already guaranteed to be at least 2, ensuring the loop will execute at least once.

### Adjusted State:
- `index` should be initialized to `n - 1` for the loop to start correctly.
- All other variables and conditions are already set to ensure the loop can execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop, `q` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements, `mo` is 1000000007, `prefb` is a list of prefix sums of `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements of `b` up to that index, followed by an additional element `0`, `b` must have at least one element, `prefbt` is a list where `prefbt[i] = i * b[i] + prefbt[i-1]` for \(1 \leq i < n - 1\) and `prefbt[0] = 0`, with an additional `0` appended to its end. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, `prefbt` is `[0, 0]`, `sc` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `d` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (sc + 1)\) initialized to 0, with the last row being `[1] * (sc + 1)`, `ds` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (sc + 2)\) initialized to 0, with the last row being `list(range(sc + 2))`, `index` is \(n - 1\)**.
