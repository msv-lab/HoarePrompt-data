To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- The loop iterates over the range `1` to `sc + 2`.
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - All other variables remain unchanged.
  - `ds[index][2]` is updated to the value \(((ds_0 + d_0) \% mo + d_1) \% mo\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for pref in range(1, sc + 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `pref` is within the range `1` to `sc + 2`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `pref` is the current iteration variable.
   - `index` is the index used to update `ds[index][2]`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - After the end of the previous iteration, `pref` will be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will execute again if `pref` is still less than or equal to `sc + 1`.

### Updated State:
- `pref` is incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `pref` must be less than or equal to `sc + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`pref` is `pref + 1`, all other variables remain unchanged, `ds[index][2]` is updated to the value \(((ds_0 + d_0) \% mo + d_1) \% mo\), `pref` must be less than or equal to `sc + 1`**
