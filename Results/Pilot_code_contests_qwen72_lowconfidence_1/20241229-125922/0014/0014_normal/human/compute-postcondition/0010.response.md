The code snippet `prefb.append(k + prefb[-1])` appends the sum of the second element of `b` (denoted as `k`) and the last element of `prefb` to the end of `prefb`.

- The initial state indicates that `prefb` contains the first element of `b`.
- The second element of `b` is `k`.
- The new element appended to `prefb` will be the sum of `k` and the current last element of `prefb`.

Therefore, the new state of `prefb` will be the original `prefb` with an additional element, which is the sum of `k` and the first element of `b`.

The other variables (`n`, `c`, `b`, `q`, `x`, `le`, `mo`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop and must have at least two elements, `q` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements, `mo` is 1000000007, `prefb` is [first element of `b`, first element of `b` + `k`], `k` is the second element of `b`**
