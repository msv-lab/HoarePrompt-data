The value of `n` is updated to the integer value obtained from the last element of the list `le` by calling `le.pop()`. The list `le` is now one element shorter. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `c` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100; `b` is a list of n-1 integers where 0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100; `q` is an integer equal to 1; `x` is a list of q integers where -10^5 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^5; `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last element; `mo` is 1000000007; the condition (1) is always true.**
