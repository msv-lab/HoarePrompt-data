To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `minpref` remains the same.
- `index` remains \(n - 1\).
- `sc` remains a non-negative integer.
- `pref` remains 1.
- `ds[n - 1][1]` is updated to \((ds[n - 1][0] + d[n - 1][0]) \% mo\).

### Loop Statement:
```
for pref in range(1, sc + 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `pref` from 1 to `sc + 1` (inclusive).
- The loop condition is `pref < sc + 2`.

### Current State:
- `pref` is 1.
- `sc` is a non-negative integer.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `pref` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `pref < sc + 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- `pref` should be incremented to 2.
- All other variables (`minpref`, `index`, `sc`, `ds[n - 1][1]`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`minpref` remains the same, `index` remains \(n - 1\), `sc` remains a non-negative integer, `pref` is 2, `ds[n - 1][1]` is updated to \((ds[n - 1][0] + d[n - 1][0]) \% mo\)**.
