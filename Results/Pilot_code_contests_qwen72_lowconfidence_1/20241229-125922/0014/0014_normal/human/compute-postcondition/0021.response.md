The code appends a new element to the list `prefbt`. This new element is calculated as `k * b[k] + prefbt[-1]`. Given that `k` is 2, the new element added to `prefbt` is `2 * b[2] + prefbt[-1]`.

Since `prefbt` was initially `[0, b[1]]`, `prefbt[-1]` is `b[1]`. Therefore, the new element added to `prefbt` is `2 * b[2] + b[1]`.

Thus, the updated `prefbt` list is `[0, b[1], 2 * b[2] + b[1]]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `k` is 2, `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop, `q` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements, `mo` is 1000000007, `prefb` is a list of prefix sums of `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements of `b` up to that index, followed by an additional element `0`, `b` must have at least one element, `prefbt` is `[0, b[1], 2 * b[2] + b[1]]`**
