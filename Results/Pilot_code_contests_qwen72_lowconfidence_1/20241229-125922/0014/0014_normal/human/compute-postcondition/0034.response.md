To determine which states need adjustment to allow the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```
(minpref - index * prefb[index - 1] + prefbt[index - 1]) / (index + 1) < x
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables and Their Roles:**
   - `minpref`: Initially set to 0.
   - `index`: Initially set to `n - 1`.
   - `prefb`: A list of prefix sums of `b`.
   - `prefbt`: A list where `prefbt[i] = i * b[i] + prefbt[i-1]` for \(1 \leq i < n - 1\) and `prefbt[0] = 0`.
   - `x`: The integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\).
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop.
   - `q` is 1.
   - `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop.
   - `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements.
   - `mo` is 1000000007.
   - `prefb` is a list of prefix sums of `b`.
   - `b` must have at least one element.
   - `prefbt` is a list where `prefbt[i] = i * b[i] + prefbt[i-1]` for \(1 \leq i < n - 1\) and `prefbt[0] = 0`.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 2, `prefbt` is `[0, 0]`.
   - `sc` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
   - `d` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (sc + 1)\) initialized to 0, with the last row being `[1] * (sc + 1)`.
   - `ds` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (sc + 2)\) initialized to 0, with the last row being `list(range(sc + 2))`.
   - `index` is \(n - 1\).
   - `minpref` is 0.

3. **Condition Simplification:**
   - The condition `(minpref - index * prefb[index - 1] + prefbt[index - 1]) / (index + 1) < x` must be true for the loop to execute.
   - Substituting the initial values:
     - `minpref` is 0.
     - `index` is `n - 1`.
     - `prefb[index - 1]` is `prefb[n - 2]`.
     - `prefbt[index - 1]` is `prefbt[n - 2]`.

4. **Substitute and Simplify:**
   - The condition becomes:
     ```
     (0 - (n - 1) * prefb[n - 2] + prefbt[n - 2]) / n < x
     ```
   - Simplifying further:
     ```
     (- (n - 1) * prefb[n - 2] + prefbt[n - 2]) / n < x
     ```

5. **Ensuring the Condition is True:**
   - For the loop to execute, the left-hand side must be less than `x`.
   - This means:
     ```
     - (n - 1) * prefb[n - 2] + prefbt[n - 2] < n * x
     ```

6. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure that:
     - `prefb[n - 2]` and `prefbt[n - 2]` are such that the inequality holds.
   - Given that `prefb` and `prefbt` are derived from `b`, and `b` is a list of integers, we need to ensure that the values in `b` are such that the inequality holds.
   - Specifically, `b` should be such that the cumulative sums and weighted sums in `prefb` and `prefbt` are appropriately set to satisfy the inequality.

### Final State Adjustment:
Since the condition involves `b`, `prefb`, and `prefbt`, and these are derived from the input, the most straightforward way to ensure the loop executes is to ensure that `b` and `x` are such that the inequality holds. However, without specific values, we can only ensure that the initial conditions are consistent with the possibility of the loop executing.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop, `q` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements, `mo` is 1000000007, `prefb` is a list of prefix sums of `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements of `b` up to that index, followed by an additional element `0`, `b` must have at least one element, `prefbt` is a list where `prefbt[i] = i * b[i] + prefbt[i-1]` for \(1 \leq i < n - 1\) and `prefbt[0] = 0`, with an additional `0` appended to its end. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, `prefbt` is `[0, 0]`, `sc` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `d` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (sc + 1)\) initialized to 0, with the last row being `[1] * (sc + 1)`, `ds` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (sc + 2)\) initialized to 0, with the last row being `list(range(sc + 2))`, `index` is \(n - 1\), `minpref` is 0, and the values of `b` and `x` are such that the inequality \(- (n - 1) * prefb[n - 2] + prefbt[n - 2] < n * x\) holds.**
