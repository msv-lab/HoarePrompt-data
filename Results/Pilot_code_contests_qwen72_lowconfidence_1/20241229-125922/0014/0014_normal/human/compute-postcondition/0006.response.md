The `le.pop()` operation removes the last element from the list `le`. Given that `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last two elements, after the `pop()`, `le` will now contain one less element, specifically the second-to-last element from the original reversed list.

The other variables (`n`, `c`, `b`, `q`, `x`, `mo`, and the condition (1)) are not affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop, `q` is 1, `x` is a list of `q` integers where \(-10^5 \leq x_i \leq 10^5\), `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last three elements, `mo` is 1000000007, the condition (1) is always true.**
