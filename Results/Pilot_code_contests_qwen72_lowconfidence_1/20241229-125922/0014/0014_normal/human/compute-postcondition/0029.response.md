The provided code initializes a new 2D list `ds` with dimensions `(n + 1) x (sc + 2)`, where each element is initialized to 0. This means `ds` is a list of lists, where each inner list has `(sc + 2)` elements, all set to 0, and there are `(n + 1)` such inner lists. The existing 2D list `d` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `c` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop, `q` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements, `mo` is 1000000007, `prefb` is a list of prefix sums of `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements of `b` up to that index, followed by an additional element `0`, `b` must have at least one element, `prefbt` is a list where `prefbt[i] = i * b[i] + prefbt[i-1]` for \(1 \leq i < n - 1\) and `prefbt[0] = 0`, with an additional `0` appended to its end. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, `prefbt` is `[0, 0]`, `sc` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `d` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (sc + 1)` initialized to 0, `ds` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (sc + 2)` initialized to 0.**
