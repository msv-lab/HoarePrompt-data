The code snippet `prefbt.append(0)` adds a new element `0` to the end of the list `prefbt`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop, `q` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements, `mo` is 1000000007, `prefb` is a list of prefix sums of `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements of `b` up to that index, followed by an additional element `0`, `b` must have at least one element, `prefbt` is a list where `prefbt[i] = i * b[i] + prefbt[i-1]` for \(1 \leq i < n - 1\) and `prefbt[0] = 0`, `prefbt` now has an additional `0` appended to its end. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, `prefbt` is `[0, 0]`.**
