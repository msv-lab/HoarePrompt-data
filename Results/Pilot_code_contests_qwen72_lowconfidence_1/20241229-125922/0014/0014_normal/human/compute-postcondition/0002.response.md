Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `c` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100; `b` is a list of n-1 integers where 0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100; `q` is an integer equal to 1; `x` is a list of q integers where -10^5 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^5; `le` is a list of reversed input lines; `mo` is 1000000007; the condition (1) is always true.**
