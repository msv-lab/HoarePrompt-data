The code snippet provided assigns a specific value to the variable `mo`. This value is \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common modulus used in programming problems to prevent overflow and ensure results fit within standard integer data types.

Given the initial state, the only change is the assignment of `mo`.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; c is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100; b is a list of n-1 integers where 0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100; q is an integer equal to 1; x is a list of q integers where -10^5 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^5; `le` is a list of reversed input lines; `mo` is 1000000007**
