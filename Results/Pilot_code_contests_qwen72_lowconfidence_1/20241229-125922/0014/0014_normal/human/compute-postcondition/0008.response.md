The code snippet `prefb = [b[0]]` initializes a new list `prefb` with the first element of the list `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\).
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop.
- `q` is 1.
- `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop.
- `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements.
- `mo` is 1000000007.
- The condition (1) is always true.

After executing the code snippet `prefb = [b[0]]`, the following changes occur:
- The variable `prefb` is initialized as a list containing the first element of `b`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop, `q` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements, `mo` is 1000000007, `prefb` is a list containing the first element of `b`, the condition (1) is always true.**
