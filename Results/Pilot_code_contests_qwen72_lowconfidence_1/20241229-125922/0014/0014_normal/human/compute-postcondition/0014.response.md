The code appends a new element to the list `prefb`. The new element is calculated as `k + prefb[-1]`.

- `prefb` initially contains three elements: `[b[0], b[0] + b[2], b[0] + 2 * b[2]]`.
- `k` is the fourth element of `b`.
- The new element added to `prefb` is `k + prefb[-1]`, which translates to `k + (b[0] + 2 * b[2])`.

Therefore, the updated `prefb` list is `[b[0], b[0] + b[2], b[0] + 2 * b[2], k + b[0] + 2 * b[2]]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop and must have at least four elements, `q` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements, `mo` is 1000000007, `prefb` is `[b[0], b[0] + b[2], b[0] + 2 * b[2], k + b[0] + 2 * b[2]]`, `k` is the fourth element of `b`**.
