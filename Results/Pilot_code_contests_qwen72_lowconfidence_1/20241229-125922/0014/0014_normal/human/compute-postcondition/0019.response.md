The code snippet `prefbt.append(k * b[k] + prefbt[-1])` modifies the list `prefbt` by appending a new element calculated as `k * b[k] + prefbt[-1]`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 2
- `k` is 1
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\)
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop
- `q` is 1
- `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop
- `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements
- `mo` is 1000000007
- `prefb` is a list of prefix sums of `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements of `b` up to that index, followed by an additional element `0`
- `b` must have at least one element
- `prefbt` is `[0]`

### Impact of the Code:
- `prefbt.append(k * b[k] + prefbt[-1])` appends a new element to `prefbt`.
- The new element is calculated as `k * b[k] + prefbt[-1]`.
- Since `k` is 1, `b[k]` is `b[1]`.
- `prefbt[-1]` is the last element of `prefbt`, which is currently 0.

### Calculation:
- The new element is `1 * b[1] + 0`, which simplifies to `b[1]`.

### Updated State:
- `prefbt` is now `[0, b[1]]`.

### Output State:
**`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 1, `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop, `q` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements, `mo` is 1000000007, `prefb` is a list of prefix sums of `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements of `b` up to that index, followed by an additional element `0`, `b` must have at least one element, `prefbt` is `[0, b[1]]`**
