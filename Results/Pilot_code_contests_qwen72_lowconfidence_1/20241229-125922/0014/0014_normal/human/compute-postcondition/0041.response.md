To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop in question is:

```python
for pref in range(sc + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For this loop to execute at least once, the range `range(sc + 1)` must contain at least one element. This means that `sc + 1` must be greater than 0, or equivalently, `sc` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `minpref` is the smallest integer such that \(\frac{minpref - (n - 1) \cdot prefb[n - 2] + prefbt[n - 2]}{n} \geq x\)
- `index` is \(n - 1\)
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

We need to ensure that `sc` is at least 0 for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect this condition.

State: **`minpref` is the smallest integer such that \(\frac{minpref - (n - 1) \cdot prefb[n - 2] + prefbt[n - 2]}{n} \geq x\), `index` is \(n - 1\), `sc` must be greater than or equal to 0**
