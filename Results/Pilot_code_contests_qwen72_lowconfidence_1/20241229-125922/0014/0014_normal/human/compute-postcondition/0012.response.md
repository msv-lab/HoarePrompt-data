The code `prefb.append(k + prefb[-1])` appends a new element to the list `prefb`. This new element is the sum of the third element of `b` (stored in `k`) and the last element of `prefb`.

Let's break down the initial state and the impact of the code:

- `n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\).
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop and must have at least three elements.
- `q` is 1.
- `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop.
- `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements.
- `mo` is 1000000007.
- `prefb` is `[first element of b, first element of b + third element of b]`.
- `k` is the third element of `b`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initial `prefb`**: `prefb` is initially `[b[0], b[0] + b[2]]`.
2. **New Element Calculation**: The new element to be appended is `k + prefb[-1]`, which is `b[2] + (b[0] + b[2])`.
3. **Simplification**: This simplifies to `b[0] + 2 * b[2]`.

### Updated `prefb`:
- The new `prefb` becomes `[b[0], b[0] + b[2], b[0] + 2 * b[2]]`.

### Output State:
- `n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\).
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop and must have at least three elements.
- `q` is 1.
- `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop.
- `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements.
- `mo` is 1000000007.
- `prefb` is `[b[0], b[0] + b[2], b[0] + 2 * b[2]]`.
- `k` is the third element of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop and must have at least three elements, `q` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements, `mo` is 1000000007, `prefb` is `[b[0], b[0] + b[2], b[0] + 2 * b[2]]`, `k` is the third element of `b`**.
