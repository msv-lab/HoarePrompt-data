To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for pref in range(sc + 1):` will execute if `range(sc + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers. This means `sc + 1` must be greater than 0, which implies `sc` must be at least 0.

2. **Initial State of `pref`**: The variable `pref` will start from 0 and go up to `sc`.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables mentioned (`minpref`, `index`, `ds[index][pref]`, `d[index][pref]`, and `mo`) should remain as they are because they do not affect the loop's ability to start.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `sc` is non-negative, and `pref` is initialized to 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`minpref` is the smallest integer \(k\) such that \(k \geq x \cdot (n - 1) + (n - 2) \cdot \text{prefb}[n - 3] - \text{prefbt}[n - 3]\), `index` is \(n - 2\), `sc` is a non-negative integer, `ds[index][pref]` for each `pref` from 1 to `sc + 1` is updated to \((ds[index][pref - 1] + d[index][pref - 1]) \% mo\), `pref` is 0**
