The value of `minpref` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`index` should be \(n - 1\), `minpref` is 3, and the values of `prefb` and `prefbt` must be such that the condition `(minpref - index * prefb[index - 1] + prefbt[index - 1]) / (index + 1) < x` holds true.**
