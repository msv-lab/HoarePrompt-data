The code `c = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))` updates the value of `c` by popping the last element from `le`, splitting it into parts, converting each part to an integer, and storing these integers in `c`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\).
- `b` is a list of `n-1` integers where \(0 \leq b_i \leq 100\).
- `q` is an integer equal to 1.
- `x` is a list of `q` integers where \(-10^5 \leq x_i \leq 10^5\).
- `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last element.
- `mo` is 1000000007.
- The condition (1) is always true.

After executing the code:
- `c` is updated to the list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop.
- The last element of `le` is removed.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop, `b` is a list of `n-1` integers where \(0 \leq b_i \leq 100\), `q` is 1, `x` is a list of `q` integers where \(-10^5 \leq x_i \leq 10^5\), `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last two elements, `mo` is 1000000007, the condition (1) is always true.**
