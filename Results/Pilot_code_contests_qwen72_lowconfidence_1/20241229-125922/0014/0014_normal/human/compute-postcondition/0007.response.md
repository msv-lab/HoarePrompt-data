The code snippet `x = int(le.pop())` changes the value of `x` and modifies the list `le`. Specifically:

- `x` is now the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop.
- `le` is now the list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements (one more element removed compared to the initial state).

The other variables (`n`, `c`, `b`, `q`, `mo`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq c_i \leq 100\), `b` is a list of integers obtained from the last element of `le` before the pop, `q` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the last element of `le` before the pop, `le` is a list of reversed input lines minus the last four elements, `mo` is 1000000007, the condition (1) is always true.**
