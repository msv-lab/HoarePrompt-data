According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pref` and `sc`. The loop iterates over `pref` from 1 to `sc + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `pref` is 2, and `sc` remains a non-negative integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `pref` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Since `pref` is currently 2 and the loop condition is `pref < sc + 2`, for the loop to execute again, `sc` must be at least 2 (so that `sc + 2` is at least 4).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`minpref` remains the same, `index` remains \(n - 1\), `sc` remains a non-negative integer, `pref` is 3, `ds[n - 1][1]` is \((ds[n - 1][0] + d[n - 1][0]) \% mo\), `ds[n - 1][2]` is \(((ds[n - 1][0] + d[n - 1][0]) \% mo + d[n - 1][1]) \% mo\)**
