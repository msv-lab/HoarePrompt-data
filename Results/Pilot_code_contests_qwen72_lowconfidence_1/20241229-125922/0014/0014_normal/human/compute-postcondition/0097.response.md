The value of `minpref` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `minpref` was 2, so the new value of `minpref` is 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`minpref` is 3, `index` is \( n - 3 \), `sc` is a non-negative integer, `ds[index][pref]` for each `pref` from 1 to `sc + 1` is the cumulative sum of `d[index][i]` for `i` from 0 to `pref - 1`, taken modulo `mo`, `d[index][pref]` for each `pref` from 0 to `sc` is updated such that `d[index][pref]` is 0 if `min(pref + c[index] + 1, sc + 1) < max(0, pref)` else `d[index][pref]` is `ds[index + 1][min(pref + c[index] + 1, sc + 1)] - ds[index + 1][max(0, pref)]`, and \((0 - (n - 3) * prefb[n - 4] + prefbt[n - 4]) / (n - 2) < x\) must hold true.**
