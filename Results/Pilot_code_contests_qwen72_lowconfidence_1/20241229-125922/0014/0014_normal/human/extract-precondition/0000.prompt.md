You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version q = 1. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

There is a process that takes place on arrays a and b of length n and length n-1 respectively. 

The process is an infinite sequence of operations. Each operation is as follows: 

  * First, choose a random integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-1). 
  * Then, simultaneously set a_i = min\left(a_i, \frac{a_i+a_{i+1}-b_i}{2}\right) and a_{i+1} = max\left(a_{i+1}, \frac{a_i+a_{i+1}+b_i}{2}\right) without any rounding (so values may become non-integer). 

See notes for an example of an operation.

It can be proven that array a converges, i. e. for each i there exists a limit a_i converges to. Let function F(a, b) return the value a_1 converges to after a process on a and b.

You are given array b, but not array a. However, you are given a third array c. Array a is good if it contains only integers and satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ c_i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Your task is to count the number of good arrays a where F(a, b) ≥ x for q values of x. Since the number of arrays can be very large, print it modulo 10^9+7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2 …, c_n (0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).

The third line contains n-1 integers b_1, b_2, …, b_{n-1} (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100).

The fourth line contains a single integer q (q=1).

The fifth line contains q space separated integers x_1, x_2, …, x_q (-10^5 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^5).

Output

Output q integers, where the i-th integer is the answer to the i-th query, i. e. the number of good arrays a where F(a, b) ≥ x_i modulo 10^9+7.

Example

Input

2 3 4

Output


56

Note

The following explanation assumes b = [2, 1] and c=[2, 3, 4] (as in the sample).

Examples of arrays a that are not good: 

  * a = [3, 2, 3] is not good because a_1 > c_1; 
  * a = [0, -1, 3] is not good because a_2 < 0. 



One possible good array a is [0, 2, 4]. We can show that no operation has any effect on this array, so F(a, b) = a_1 = 0.

Another possible good array a is [0, 1, 4]. In a single operation with i = 1, we set a_1 = min((0+1-2)/(2), 0) and a_2 = max((0+1+2)/(2), 1). So, after a single operation with i = 1, a becomes equal to [-1/2, 3/2, 4]. We can show that no operation has any effect on this array, so F(a, b) = -1/2.
