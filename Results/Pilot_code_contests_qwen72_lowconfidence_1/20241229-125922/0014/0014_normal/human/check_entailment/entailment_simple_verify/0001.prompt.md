You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version q = 1. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

There is a process that takes place on arrays a and b of length n and length n-1 respectively. 

The process is an infinite sequence of operations. Each operation is as follows: 

  * First, choose a random integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-1). 
  * Then, simultaneously set a_i = min\left(a_i, \frac{a_i+a_{i+1}-b_i}{2}\right) and a_{i+1} = max\left(a_{i+1}, \frac{a_i+a_{i+1}+b_i}{2}\right) without any rounding (so values may become non-integer). 

See notes for an example of an operation.

It can be proven that array a converges, i. e. for each i there exists a limit a_i converges to. Let function F(a, b) return the value a_1 converges to after a process on a and b.

You are given array b, but not array a. However, you are given a third array c. Array a is good if it contains only integers and satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ c_i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Your task is to count the number of good arrays a where F(a, b) ≥ x for q values of x. Since the number of arrays can be very large, print it modulo 10^9+7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2 …, c_n (0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).

The third line contains n-1 integers b_1, b_2, …, b_{n-1} (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100).

The fourth line contains a single integer q (q=1).

The fifth line contains q space separated integers x_1, x_2, …, x_q (-10^5 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^5).

Output

Output q integers, where the i-th integer is the answer to the i-th query, i. e. the number of good arrays a where F(a, b) ≥ x_i modulo 10^9+7.

Example

Input


3
2 3 4
2 1
1
-1


Output


56

Note

The following explanation assumes b = [2, 1] and c=[2, 3, 4] (as in the sample).

Examples of arrays a that are not good: 

  * a = [3, 2, 3] is not good because a_1 > c_1; 
  * a = [0, -1, 3] is not good because a_2 < 0. 



One possible good array a is [0, 2, 4]. We can show that no operation has any effect on this array, so F(a, b) = a_1 = 0.

Another possible good array a is [0, 1, 4]. In a single operation with i = 1, we set a_1 = min((0+1-2)/(2), 0) and a_2 = max((0+1+2)/(2), 1). So, after a single operation with i = 1, a becomes equal to [-1/2, 3/2, 4]. We can show that no operation has any effect on this array, so F(a, b) = -1/2.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**: The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read().split('\n')[::-1]` to handle the input lines in reverse order, which is a valid approach for reading inputs in Python. It initializes necessary variables and data structures, including the modulo constant `mo`.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays (`prefb` and `prefbt`)**: These arrays are used to store cumulative sums of elements from the array `b`. This is a common technique to optimize certain types of queries and calculations involving subarrays.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Tables (`d` and `ds`)**: The DP table `d` is used to store the number of valid arrays `a` that satisfy the conditions up to a certain prefix sum. The auxiliary table `ds` is used to maintain cumulative sums of the DP table, which helps in efficiently calculating ranges.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the indices of the array `a` in reverse order.
   - For each index, it calculates the minimum prefix sum required to ensure that the condition \( F(a, b) \geq x \) is met.
   - It then updates the DP table `d` based on the current prefix sum and the constraints defined by the problem.
   - The auxiliary table `ds` is updated to maintain cumulative sums, which are used to efficiently compute the range sums needed for the DP table.

5. **Output**: The final result is printed as the value of `d[0][0] % mo`, which represents the number of valid arrays `a` that satisfy the condition \( F(a, b) \geq x \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

The program appears to handle all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid arrays `a` and ensures that the output is computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
