You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version q = 1. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

There is a process that takes place on arrays a and b of length n and length n-1 respectively. 

The process is an infinite sequence of operations. Each operation is as follows: 

  * First, choose a random integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-1). 
  * Then, simultaneously set a_i = min\left(a_i, \frac{a_i+a_{i+1}-b_i}{2}\right) and a_{i+1} = max\left(a_{i+1}, \frac{a_i+a_{i+1}+b_i}{2}\right) without any rounding (so values may become non-integer). 

See notes for an example of an operation.

It can be proven that array a converges, i. e. for each i there exists a limit a_i converges to. Let function F(a, b) return the value a_1 converges to after a process on a and b.

You are given array b, but not array a. However, you are given a third array c. Array a is good if it contains only integers and satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ c_i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Your task is to count the number of good arrays a where F(a, b) ≥ x for q values of x. Since the number of arrays can be very large, print it modulo 10^9+7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2 …, c_n (0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).

The third line contains n-1 integers b_1, b_2, …, b_{n-1} (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100).

The fourth line contains a single integer q (q=1).

The fifth line contains q space separated integers x_1, x_2, …, x_q (-10^5 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^5).

Output

Output q integers, where the i-th integer is the answer to the i-th query, i. e. the number of good arrays a where F(a, b) ≥ x_i modulo 10^9+7.

Example

Input


3
2 3 4
2 1
1
-1


Output


56

Note

The following explanation assumes b = [2, 1] and c=[2, 3, 4] (as in the sample).

Examples of arrays a that are not good: 

  * a = [3, 2, 3] is not good because a_1 > c_1; 
  * a = [0, -1, 3] is not good because a_2 < 0. 



One possible good array a is [0, 2, 4]. We can show that no operation has any effect on this array, so F(a, b) = a_1 = 0.

Another possible good array a is [0, 1, 4]. In a single operation with i = 1, we set a_1 = min((0+1-2)/(2), 0) and a_2 = max((0+1+2)/(2), 1). So, after a single operation with i = 1, a becomes equal to [-1/2, 3/2, 4]. We can show that no operation has any effect on this array, so F(a, b) = -1/2.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division,print_function
from heapq import*
import sys

def func():
    le = sys.__stdin__.read().split('\n')[::-1]
    mo = 10 ** 9 + 7
    if 1:
        n = int(le.pop())
        c = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
        b = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
        le.pop()
        x = int(le.pop())
        prefb = [b[0]]
        for k in b[1:]:
            prefb.append(k + prefb[-1])
        prefb.append(0)
        prefbt = [0]
        for k in range(1, n - 1):
            prefbt.append(k * b[k] + prefbt[-1])
        prefbt.append(0)
    sc = sum(c)
    d = [[0] * (sc + 1) for k in range(n + 1)]
    ds = [[0] * (sc + 2) for k in range(n + 1)]
    ds[-1] = list(range(sc + 2))
    d[-1] = [1] * (sc + 1)
    for index in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        minpref = 0
        while (minpref - index * prefb[index - 1] + prefbt[index - 1]) / (index + 1) < x:
            minpref += 1
        for pref in range(sc + 1):
            mi = min(pref + c[index] + 1, sc + 1)
            ma = max(minpref, pref)
            d[index][pref] = 0 if mi < ma else ds[index + 1][mi] - ds[index + 1][ma]
        for pref in range(1, sc + 2):
            ds[index][pref] = (ds[index][pref - 1] + d[index][pref - 1]) % mo
    print(d[0][0] % mo)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
