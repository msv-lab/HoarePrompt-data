Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It reads input from standard input, processes the input according to the specified rules, and computes the number of valid configurations of `c` and `b` that satisfy the condition \( F(a, b) \geq x \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the input correctly and processes it into the required variables (`n`, `c`, `b`, and `x`).
2. **Prefix Sums and Weighted Prefix Sums**: The code correctly computes the prefix sums (`prefb`) and weighted prefix sums (`prefbt`) of the array `b`.
3. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The dynamic programming table `d` and cumulative sum table `ds` are initialized correctly.
4. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The dynamic programming logic is implemented correctly, ensuring that the minimum prefix sum (`minpref`) is calculated and used to update the DP table `d` and cumulative sum table `ds`.
5. **Final Result Calculation**: The final result is computed and printed as `d[0][0] % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Small `n` Values**: The code handles small values of `n` (e.g., `n = 2`) correctly. For `n = 2`, the prefix sums and weighted prefix sums are handled appropriately, and the dynamic programming logic is applied correctly.
- **Large `n` Values**: The code is designed to handle the maximum value of `n` (100) efficiently using dynamic programming.
- **Edge Cases for `x`**: The code correctly handles the edge cases for `x` (both very negative and very positive values).

### Verification:
- **Input Format**: The code assumes the input format is correct, which is a reasonable assumption as per the problem description.
- **Output**: The output is a single integer, which is the result of the dynamic programming algorithm, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Given the above points, the code appears to handle all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
