You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version q = 1. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

There is a process that takes place on arrays a and b of length n and length n-1 respectively. 

The process is an infinite sequence of operations. Each operation is as follows: 

  * First, choose a random integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-1). 
  * Then, simultaneously set a_i = min\left(a_i, \frac{a_i+a_{i+1}-b_i}{2}\right) and a_{i+1} = max\left(a_{i+1}, \frac{a_i+a_{i+1}+b_i}{2}\right) without any rounding (so values may become non-integer). 

See notes for an example of an operation.

It can be proven that array a converges, i. e. for each i there exists a limit a_i converges to. Let function F(a, b) return the value a_1 converges to after a process on a and b.

You are given array b, but not array a. However, you are given a third array c. Array a is good if it contains only integers and satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ c_i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Your task is to count the number of good arrays a where F(a, b) ≥ x for q values of x. Since the number of arrays can be very large, print it modulo 10^9+7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2 …, c_n (0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).

The third line contains n-1 integers b_1, b_2, …, b_{n-1} (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100).

The fourth line contains a single integer q (q=1).

The fifth line contains q space separated integers x_1, x_2, …, x_q (-10^5 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^5).

Output

Output q integers, where the i-th integer is the answer to the i-th query, i. e. the number of good arrays a where F(a, b) ≥ x_i modulo 10^9+7.

Example

Input


3
2 3 4
2 1
1
-1


Output


56

Note

The following explanation assumes b = [2, 1] and c=[2, 3, 4] (as in the sample).

Examples of arrays a that are not good: 

  * a = [3, 2, 3] is not good because a_1 > c_1; 
  * a = [0, -1, 3] is not good because a_2 < 0. 



One possible good array a is [0, 2, 4]. We can show that no operation has any effect on this array, so F(a, b) = a_1 = 0.

Another possible good array a is [0, 1, 4]. In a single operation with i = 1, we set a_1 = min((0+1-2)/(2), 0) and a_2 = max((0+1+2)/(2), 1). So, after a single operation with i = 1, a becomes equal to [-1/2, 3/2, 4]. We can show that no operation has any effect on this array, so F(a, b) = -1/2.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division,print_function
from heapq import*
import sys

def func():
    le = sys.__stdin__.read().split('\n')[::-1]
    mo = 10 ** 9 + 7
    if 1:
        n = int(le.pop())
        c = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
        b = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
        le.pop()
        x = int(le.pop())
        prefb = [b[0]]
        for k in b[1:]:
            prefb.append(k + prefb[-1])
        prefb.append(0)
        prefbt = [0]
        for k in range(1, n - 1):
            prefbt.append(k * b[k] + prefbt[-1])
        prefbt.append(0)
    sc = sum(c)
    d = [[0] * (sc + 1) for k in range(n + 1)]
    ds = [[0] * (sc + 2) for k in range(n + 1)]
    ds[-1] = list(range(sc + 2))
    d[-1] = [1] * (sc + 1)
    for index in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        minpref = 0
        while (minpref - index * prefb[index - 1] + prefbt[index - 1]) / (index + 1) < x:
            minpref += 1
        for pref in range(sc + 1):
            mi = min(pref + c[index] + 1, sc + 1)
            ma = max(minpref, pref)
            d[index][pref] = 0 if mi < ma else ds[index + 1][mi] - ds[index + 1][ma]
        for pref in range(1, sc + 2):
            ds[index][pref] = (ds[index][pref - 1] + d[index][pref - 1]) % mo
    print(d[0][0] % mo)


```
Output hints: The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and computes a specific value based on the inputs. It accepts no explicit parameters but expects the input to be provided in a specific format. The input consists of several lines, where the first line contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), the second line contains a list of `n` integers `c` (0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100), the third line contains a list of `n-1` integers `b` (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100), and the fourth line contains an integer `x` (-10^5 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^5). The function computes and prints a single integer, which is the result of a dynamic programming algorithm that calculates the number of valid configurations of `c` and `b` that satisfy certain conditions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The final state of the program includes the following: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `c` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, `b` is a list of `n-1` integers where 0 ≤ b_i ≤ 100, `x` is an integer, `prefb` is a list of prefix sums of `b` with an additional `0` appended, `prefbt` is a list of weighted prefix sums of `b` with an additional `0` appended, `sc` is the sum of all elements in `c`, `d` is a 2D list used for dynamic programming, and `ds` is a 2D list used for cumulative sums. The function prints the result of `d[0][0] % (10^9 + 7)`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 2 or less, which results in `prefbt` being `[0, 0]`.

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
