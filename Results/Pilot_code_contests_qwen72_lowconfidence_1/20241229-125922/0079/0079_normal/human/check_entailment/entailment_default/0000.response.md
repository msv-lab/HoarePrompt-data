Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where `n` is less than 2, which is a valid input according to the problem description (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). If `n` is less than 2, the function does not process the string, and `d` remains an empty dictionary. As a result, the sorting step will raise an error because the dictionary is empty and there is no item to sort. This violates the requirement that the program should work correctly for every potential case within the specified input constraints. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
