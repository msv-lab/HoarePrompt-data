Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description due to the following issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` to read the integer `n` and `raw_input()` to read the string `s`. However, in Python 3, `raw_input()` has been replaced by `input()`. The correct way to handle both inputs in Python 3 would be to use `input()` twice. The current implementation will work correctly in Python 2 but will fail in Python 3, which is more commonly used today.

2. **Input Type and Range Validation**: The problem description specifies that `n` should be an integer within the range [2, 100]. The program does not validate that `n` is an integer or that it falls within this range. While the problem description assumes valid input, it is good practice to include such checks to ensure robustness.

3. **Dictionary Initialization and Loop Range**: The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, which is correct for generating bigrams. However, the program does not handle the case where `n` is less than 2. According to the problem description, `n` should always be at least 2, so this is not a critical issue, but it's worth noting.

4. **Output Format**: The program correctly prints the most frequent bigram, which meets the output requirement of the problem description. However, if there are multiple bigrams with the same maximum frequency, the program will only print the first one encountered in the sorted list. This is acceptable according to the problem description, which states that any most frequent bigram can be printed.

Given these points, the primary issue is the use of `raw_input()` in Python 3, which will cause the program to fail. Therefore, the program is **not** correct as per the problem description.

To make the program correct, it should be modified to use `input()` for both inputs and optionally include validation for the input range. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    d = {}
    for i in range(1, n):
        gram = s[i - 1:i + 1]
        
        if d.get(gram) is None:
            d[gram] = 1
        else:
            d[gram] += 1
    
    a = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    print(a[0][0])
```

With these changes, the program will meet the requirements of the problem description and be considered correct.
