You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Two-gram is an ordered pair (i.e. string of length two) of capital Latin letters. For example, "AZ", "AA", "ZA" — three distinct two-grams.

You are given a string s consisting of n capital Latin letters. Your task is to find any two-gram contained in the given string as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times. For example, for string s = "BBAABBBA" the answer is two-gram "BB", which contained in s three times. In other words, find any most frequent two-gram.

Note that occurrences of the two-gram can overlap with each other.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of string s. The second line of the input contains the string s consisting of n capital Latin letters.

Output

Print the only line containing exactly two capital Latin letters — any two-gram contained in the given string s as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times.

Examples

Input

7
ABACABA


Output

AB


Input

5
ZZZAA


Output

ZZ

Note

In the first example "BA" is also valid answer.

In the second example the only two-gram "ZZ" can be printed because it contained in the string "ZZZAA" two times.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the string, and a string s of length n consisting of capital Latin letters.
def func():
    n = input()
    s = raw_input()
    d = {}
    for i in range(1, n):
        gram = s[i - 1:i + 1]
        
        if d.get(gram) == None:
            d[gram] = 1
        else:
            d[gram] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input value, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a bigram (a substring of length 2) from `s` and each value is the count of occurrences of that bigram in `s`. If `n` is less than 2, `d` remains an empty dictionary.
    a = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    print(a[0][0])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user, where `n` is expected to be between 2 and 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of uppercase Latin letters. It then constructs a dictionary `d` where each key is a bigram (a substring of length 2) from `s`, and each value is the count of occurrences of that bigram in `s`. If `n` is less than 2, the function does not process the string and `d` remains an empty dictionary. The function sorts the dictionary `d` by the counts of bigrams in descending order and prints the most frequent bigram. If multiple bigrams have the same highest frequency, it prints the first one encountered in the sorted list. The function does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
