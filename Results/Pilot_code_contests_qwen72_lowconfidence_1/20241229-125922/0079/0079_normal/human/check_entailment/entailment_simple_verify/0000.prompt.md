You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two-gram is an ordered pair (i.e. string of length two) of capital Latin letters. For example, "AZ", "AA", "ZA" — three distinct two-grams.

You are given a string s consisting of n capital Latin letters. Your task is to find any two-gram contained in the given string as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times. For example, for string s = "BBAABBBA" the answer is two-gram "BB", which contained in s three times. In other words, find any most frequent two-gram.

Note that occurrences of the two-gram can overlap with each other.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of string s. The second line of the input contains the string s consisting of n capital Latin letters.

Output

Print the only line containing exactly two capital Latin letters — any two-gram contained in the given string s as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times.

Examples

Input

7
ABACABA


Output

AB


Input

5
ZZZAA


Output

ZZ

Note

In the first example "BA" is also valid answer.

In the second example the only two-gram "ZZ" can be printed because it contained in the string "ZZZAA" two times.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    s = raw_input()
    d = {}
    for i in range(1, n):
        gram = s[i - 1:i + 1]
        if d.get(gram) == None:
            d[gram] = 1
        else:
            d[gram] += 1
    a = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    print(a[0][0])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the case when the input string `s` has a length `n` equal to 2. According to the problem description, the minimum value for `n` is 2. When `n` is 2, the loop `for i in range(1, n)` will not execute because the range will be empty, resulting in an empty dictionary `d`. Consequently, the program will raise an error when trying to access `a[0][0]` since `a` will be an empty list.

Example Input:
```
2
AB
```
Expected Output:
```
AB
```
Actual Output:
```
Error (IndexError: list index out of range)
```
This shows that the program does not work correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the string, and a string s of length n consisting of capital Latin letters.
def func():
    n = input()
    s = raw_input()
    d = {}
    for i in range(1, n):
        gram = s[i - 1:i + 1]
        
        if d.get(gram) == None:
            d[gram] = 1
        else:
            d[gram] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input value, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a bigram (a substring of length 2) from `s` and each value is the count of occurrences of that bigram in `s`. If `n` is less than 2, `d` remains an empty dictionary.
    a = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    print(a[0][0])


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
