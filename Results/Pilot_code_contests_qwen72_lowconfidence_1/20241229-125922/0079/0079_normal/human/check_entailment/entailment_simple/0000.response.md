Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function `func()` reads the input using `input()` and `raw_input()`, which are specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `raw_input()` has been replaced by `input()`. Therefore, the program would not run correctly in Python 3, which is the more commonly used version today.
   - The function does not explicitly take parameters for `n` and `s`. Instead, it reads them directly from the standard input. This makes the function less modular and harder to test, but it is not necessarily incorrect in this context.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the string `s` has a length of 1. According to the problem description, `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2, so this is not a critical issue, but it is worth noting.

3. **Output**:
   - The program correctly identifies the most frequent two-gram and prints it. However, it does not handle the case where there are multiple two-grams with the same maximum frequency. The problem description does not specify what to do in this case, but it is generally expected to print any one of the most frequent two-grams. The current implementation will print the first one encountered in the sorted list, which is acceptable.

4. **Dictionary Initialization**:
   - The program uses `d.get(gram) == None` to check if a two-gram is already in the dictionary. While this works, it is more idiomatic in Python to use `if gram not in d:` or `d.get(gram, 0) + 1`.

5. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the dictionary items by their values in descending order and prints the first one. This is correct, but it could be optimized by finding the maximum value and then iterating through the dictionary to find the first key with that value, avoiding the need to sort the entire dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The program mostly meets the problem description, but it has some issues with input handling and Python version compatibility. These issues make the program incorrect according to the problem description, especially considering that the problem description assumes a Python 3 environment. Therefore, the program is marked as **False**.
