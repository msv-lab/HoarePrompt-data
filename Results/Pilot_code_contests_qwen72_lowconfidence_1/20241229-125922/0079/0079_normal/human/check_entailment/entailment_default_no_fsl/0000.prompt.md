You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two-gram is an ordered pair (i.e. string of length two) of capital Latin letters. For example, "AZ", "AA", "ZA" — three distinct two-grams.

You are given a string s consisting of n capital Latin letters. Your task is to find any two-gram contained in the given string as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times. For example, for string s = "BBAABBBA" the answer is two-gram "BB", which contained in s three times. In other words, find any most frequent two-gram.

Note that occurrences of the two-gram can overlap with each other.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of string s. The second line of the input contains the string s consisting of n capital Latin letters.

Output

Print the only line containing exactly two capital Latin letters — any two-gram contained in the given string s as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times.

Examples

Input

7
ABACABA


Output

AB


Input

5
ZZZAA


Output

ZZ

Note

In the first example "BA" is also valid answer.

In the second example the only two-gram "ZZ" can be printed because it contained in the string "ZZZAA" two times.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    s = raw_input()
    d = {}
    for i in range(1, n):
        gram = s[i - 1:i + 1]
        if d.get(gram) == None:
            d[gram] = 1
        else:
            d[gram] += 1
    a = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    print(a[0][0])


```
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user, where `n` is expected to be between 2 and 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of uppercase Latin letters. It then constructs a dictionary `d` where each key is a bigram (a substring of length 2) from `s`, and each value is the count of occurrences of that bigram in `s`. If `n` is less than 2, the function does not process the string and `d` remains an empty dictionary. The function sorts the dictionary `d` by the counts of bigrams in descending order and prints the most frequent bigram. If multiple bigrams have the same highest frequency, it prints the first one encountered in the sorted list. The function does not return any value.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
