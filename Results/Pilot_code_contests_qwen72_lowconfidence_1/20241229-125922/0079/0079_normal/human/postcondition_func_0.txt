The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user, where `n` is expected to be between 2 and 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of uppercase Latin letters. It then constructs a dictionary `d` where each key is a bigram (a substring of length 2) from `s`, and each value is the count of occurrences of that bigram in `s`. If `n` is less than 2, the function does not process the string and `d` remains an empty dictionary. The function sorts the dictionary `d` by the counts of bigrams in descending order and prints the most frequent bigram. If multiple bigrams have the same highest frequency, it prints the first one encountered in the sorted list. The function does not return any value.
