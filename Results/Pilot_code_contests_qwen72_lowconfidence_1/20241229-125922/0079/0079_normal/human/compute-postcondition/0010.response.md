To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters.
- `i` is 1.
- `gram` is the first two characters of `s`.
- If `d.get(gram)` is None, `d` is a dictionary with `gram` as a key and 1 as its value. Otherwise, `d` is a dictionary with the key `gram` whose value is incremented by 1.

### Loop Condition:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `gram` is the first two characters of `s`.
   - `d` is updated based on the value of `gram`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The loop condition `i < n` must still hold true, so `n` must be greater than 2.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.
   - `gram` will now be the substring of `s` starting from the second character and ending at the third character (i.e., `s[1:3]`).

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `i` is 2, `gram` is the second and third characters of `s`. If `d.get(gram)` is None, `d` is a dictionary with `gram` as a key and 1 as its value. Otherwise, `d` is a dictionary with the key `gram` whose value is incremented by 1.**
