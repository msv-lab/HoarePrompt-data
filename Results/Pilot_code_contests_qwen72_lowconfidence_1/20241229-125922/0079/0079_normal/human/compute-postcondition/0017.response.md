The code snippet `d[gram] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `gram` in the dictionary `d`. This means that regardless of whether `d.get(gram)` was `None` or had a value before, now the key `gram` in `d` will have the value 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be greater than 3, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `i` is 3, `gram` is the 4th and 5th characters of `s`, `d` is a dictionary with `gram` as a key and 1 as its value.**
