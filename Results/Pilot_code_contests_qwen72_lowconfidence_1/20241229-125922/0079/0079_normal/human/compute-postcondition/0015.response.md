According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

Given the current state:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters.
- `i` is 2.
- `gram` is the second and third characters of `s`.
- If `d.get(gram)` is None, `d` is a dictionary with `gram` as a key and 1 as its value. Otherwise, `d` is a dictionary with the key `gram` whose value is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

The new state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `i` is 3, `gram` is the third and fourth characters of `s`. If `d.get(gram)` is None, `d` is a dictionary with `gram` as a key and 1 as its value. Otherwise, `d` is a dictionary with the key `gram` whose value is incremented by 1.**
