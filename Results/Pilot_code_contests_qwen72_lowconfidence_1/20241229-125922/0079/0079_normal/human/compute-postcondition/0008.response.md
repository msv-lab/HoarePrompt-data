The code snippet updates the value associated with the key `gram` in the dictionary `d` by incrementing it by 1. Since `d[gram]` already has a non-None value, this operation will increase its value by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be at least 2, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `d` is a dictionary with the key `gram` whose value is now `d[gram] + 1`, `i` is 1, `gram` is the first two characters of `s`**.
