The code snippet `d[gram] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `gram` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Based on the initial state, `d` already contains the key `gram` with a value, which means `d.get(gram)` is not None. The value of `gram` is the second and third characters of the string `s`.

Therefore, the value of `d[gram]` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `i`, `gram`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `i` is 2, `gram` is the second and third characters of `s`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `gram` whose value is incremented by 1.**
