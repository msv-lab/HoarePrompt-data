The code snippet `d[gram] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `gram` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Given the initial state, we know that `d` already contains the key `gram` (since `d.get(gram)` is not None), and its value is being incremented.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be greater than 3, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `i` is 3, `gram` is the 4th and 5th characters of `s`, `d` is a dictionary with `gram` as a key and its value is incremented by 1.**
