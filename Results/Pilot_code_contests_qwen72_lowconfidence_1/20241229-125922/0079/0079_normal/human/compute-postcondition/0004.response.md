The code snippet `gram = s[i - 1:i + 1]` extracts a substring from `s` starting at index `i-1` and ending at index `i+1` (exclusive). Given the initial state:

- `n` must be at least 2
- `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters
- `d` is an empty dictionary
- `i` is 1

The substring `gram` will be the first two characters of `s` because `i-1` is 0 and `i+1` is 2, so `gram` will be `s[0:2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be at least 2, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `d` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 1, `gram` is the first two characters of `s`**
