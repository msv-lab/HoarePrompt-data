The code snippet sorts the items of the dictionary `d` based on the values (counts of bigrams) in descending order and assigns the sorted list to the variable `a`.

- The variable `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- The variable `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters.
- The variable `d` is a dictionary where each key is a bigram from `s` and each value is the count of occurrences of that bigram in `s`. If `n` is less than 2, `d` remains an empty dictionary.

After the code execution:
- The variable `a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a bigram (key from `d`) and its count (value from `d`), sorted by the count in descending order.
- The values of `n`, `s`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an input value, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a bigram from `s` and each value is the count of occurrences of that bigram in `s` (empty if `n` < 2), `a` is a list of tuples sorted by the counts of bigrams in `d` in descending order.**
