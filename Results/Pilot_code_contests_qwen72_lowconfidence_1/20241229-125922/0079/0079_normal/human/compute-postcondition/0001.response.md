The code snippet `s = raw_input()` assigns the input from the user to the variable `s`. The initial state specifies that `s` should be a string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, and `n` is an input value. After executing this code, `s` will hold the value of the input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input value, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters.**
