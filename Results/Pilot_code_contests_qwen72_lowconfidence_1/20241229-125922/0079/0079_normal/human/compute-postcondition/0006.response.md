The value of `d[gram]` is set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` must be at least 2, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `d` is a dictionary with `gram` as a key and 1 as its value, `i` is 1, `gram` is the first two characters of `s`.
