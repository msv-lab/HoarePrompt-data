Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user, where `n` is expected to be between 2 and 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of uppercase Latin letters. It then constructs a dictionary `d` where each key is a bigram (a substring of length 2) from `s`, and each value is the count of occurrences of that bigram in `s`. If `n` is less than 2, the function does not process the string and `d` remains an empty dictionary. The function sorts the dictionary `d` by the counts of bigrams in descending order and prints the most frequent bigram. If multiple bigrams have the same highest frequency, it prints the first one encountered in the sorted list. The function does not return any value. **

**Edge Cases and Missing Logic:**
- The function does not validate the input `n` to ensure it is within the range [2, 100]. If `n` is outside this range, the function may still attempt to process the string, leading to unexpected behavior.
- The function does not handle the case where the input string `s` is not exactly `n` characters long. If `s` is shorter or longer than `n`, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an error.
- The function does not handle the case where the input string `s` contains characters other than uppercase Latin letters, which could lead to incorrect bigram counts or errors.
- If `n` is exactly 1, the function will not enter the for loop, and `d` will remain an empty dictionary, leading to an error when attempting to access `a[0][0]` since `a` will be an empty list. This should be handled to avoid runtime errors.
