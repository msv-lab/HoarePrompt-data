The code updates the value of `gram` to be the substring of `s` from index `i-1` to `i+1` (non-inclusive). Given `i` is 3, this means `gram` is updated to the substring of `s` starting from the 3rd index to the 4th index. The rest of the preconditions remain unchanged.

Since `i` is 3, the new `gram` will be the 4th and 5th characters of `s`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `i` is 3, `gram` is the 4th and 5th characters of `s`. If `d.get(gram)` is None, `d` is a dictionary with `gram` as a key and 1 as its value. Otherwise, `d` is a dictionary with the key `gram` whose value is incremented by 1.**
