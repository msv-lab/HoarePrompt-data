The code `d[gram] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `gram` in the dictionary `d`. This means that regardless of whether `d.get(gram)` was previously `None` or had some other value, `d[gram]` is now set to 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters
- `i` is 2
- `gram` is the second and third characters of `s`
- `d` is a dictionary with `gram` as a key and 1 as its value

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `i` is 2, `gram` is the second and third characters of `s`, `d` is a dictionary with `gram` as a key and 1 as its value**
