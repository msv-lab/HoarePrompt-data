According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, so `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. Additionally, the variable `i` should start at 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `d` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 1**
