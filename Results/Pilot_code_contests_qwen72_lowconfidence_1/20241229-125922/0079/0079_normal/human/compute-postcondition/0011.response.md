The code snippet `gram = s[i - 1:i + 1]` updates the value of `gram` to be the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `i-1` up to (but not including) the character at index `i+1`. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 2
- `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters
- `i` is 2
- `gram` is the second and third characters of `s`
- If `d.get(gram)` is None, `d` is a dictionary with `gram` as a key and 1 as its value. Otherwise, `d` is a dictionary with the key `gram` whose value is incremented by 1.

Let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:

- `i` is 2, so `i - 1` is 1 and `i + 1` is 3.
- `gram` will now be updated to the substring of `s` from index 1 to index 3 (which includes the second and third characters of `s`).

Since the initial state already specifies that `gram` is the second and third characters of `s`, this update does not change the value of `gram`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `i` is 2, `gram` is the second and third characters of `s`. If `d.get(gram)` is None, `d` is a dictionary with `gram` as a key and 1 as its value. Otherwise, `d` is a dictionary with the key `gram` whose value is incremented by 1.**
