Output State: **`n` is an input value, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a bigram (a substring of length 2) from `s` and each value is the count of occurrences of that bigram in `s`. If `n` is less than 2, `d` remains an empty dictionary.**
