The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` has a constraint of 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the string `s` must consist of capital Latin letters and have a length equal to `n`. The function's return value is not specified in the given context, so we cannot provide details about the output. However, based on the parameters, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of capital Latin letters.**
