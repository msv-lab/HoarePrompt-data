Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The primary issue lies in the function `func_1`, which is intended to handle input but instead redefines the standard output and input streams using `cStringIO`. This function does not process the input parameters `n`, `x`, and `v` as required by the problem description. Instead, it reads from the standard input and writes to a `BytesIO` object, which is not how the input should be handled according to the problem description.

Additionally, the main logic of the program, which involves calculating the minimum distances between points, relies on the correct processing of input data. Since `func_1` does not correctly handle the input, the rest of the program may not receive the necessary data to perform the calculations accurately.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
3
1 3 2
-100 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

However, due to the issues with `func_1`, the program may not correctly read and process this input, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
