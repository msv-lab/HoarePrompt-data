Final: **False**

Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Misalignment**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to handle input reading but is not properly defined for the given problem. It does not accept parameters and instead redefines the standard output stream to a `BytesIO` object. This misalignment in the function definition and its purpose indicates a fundamental issue in how the program handles input.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `input = func_1()` to redefine the `input` function, which is unconventional and can lead to unexpected behavior. The standard way to handle input in Python is to use `sys.stdin` directly or the built-in `input` function. The current approach complicates the input handling and can cause issues.

3. **Logical Error in Distance Calculation**:
   - The provided explanation of the failure in the specific case:
     - Points: \( (1, -1) \), \( (2, 0) \), \( (3, 1) \)
     - Expected output: 2
     - Actual output: Different result
   - The program fails to correctly calculate the minimum distances between the points. This is a critical logical error that directly affects the correctness of the program.

4. **Annotations and State Analysis**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program does not handle input correctly and that the `func_1` function is not aligned with the problem requirements.
   - The state of the program before and after the function calls indicates that the input handling is flawed, which can lead to incorrect processing of the points and their movements.

Given these points, the original assessment of **False** is accurate. The program does not meet the problem description due to issues in input handling and logical errors in distance calculation.
