You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n points on a coordinate axis OX. The i-th point is located at the integer point x_i and has a speed v_i. It is guaranteed that no two points occupy the same coordinate. All n points move with the constant speed, the coordinate of the i-th point at the moment t (t can be non-integer) is calculated as x_i + t ⋅ v_i.

Consider two points i and j. Let d(i, j) be the minimum possible distance between these two points over any possible moments of time (even non-integer). It means that if two points i and j coincide at some moment, the value d(i, j) will be 0.

Your task is to calculate the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of points.

The second line of the input contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8), where x_i is the initial coordinate of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that all x_i are distinct.

The third line of the input contains n integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_n (-10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8), where v_i is the speed of the i-th point.

Output

Print one integer — the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for calculating the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points moving along a coordinate axis with constant speeds. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program reads the input and sorts the points based on their coordinates and speeds. This ensures that the points are processed in a meaningful order for the calculation of minimum distances.

2. **Order Tree Implementation**: The `order_tree` class is used to efficiently manage and query the positions and counts of points. The tree structure allows for fast updates and queries, which is crucial for handling up to \(2 \times 10^5\) points.

3. **Query and Update Methods**: The `query` method calculates the sum and count of points up to a given index, while the `update` method updates the tree with new values. These methods ensure that the program can efficiently compute the required sums and counts.

4. **Main Loop**: The main loop iterates over the points in reverse order, updating the tree and calculating the minimum distances. The formula used in the loop correctly accounts for the relative positions and speeds of the points.

5. **Output**: The final result is printed, which is the sum of the minimum distances over all pairs of points.

Given the complexity of the problem and the efficient implementation of the solution, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. No obvious edge cases or logical errors were identified that would cause the program to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` is intended to accept three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of points, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `x` (a list of integers representing the initial coordinates of the points, where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8), and `v` (a list of integers representing the speeds of the points, where -10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8). However, the function as defined does not accept any parameters and instead redefines the standard output stream to a `BytesIO` object. It then returns a method that reads a line from a `BytesIO` object, which contains the content read from file descriptor 0 (standard input) up to the size of the file. The function does not process the points, their coordinates, or their speeds in any way. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, and the returned method can be used to read lines from the standard input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
