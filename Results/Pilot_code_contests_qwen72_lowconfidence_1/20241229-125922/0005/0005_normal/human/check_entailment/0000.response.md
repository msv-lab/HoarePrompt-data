Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for calculating the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points moving along a coordinate axis with constant speeds. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program reads the input and sorts the points based on their coordinates and speeds. This ensures that the points are processed in a meaningful order for the calculation of minimum distances.

2. **Order Tree Implementation**: The `order_tree` class is used to efficiently manage and query the positions and counts of points. The tree structure allows for fast updates and queries, which is crucial for handling up to \(2 \times 10^5\) points.

3. **Query and Update Methods**: The `query` method calculates the sum and count of points up to a given index, while the `update` method updates the tree with new values. These methods ensure that the program can efficiently compute the required sums and counts.

4. **Main Loop**: The main loop iterates over the points in reverse order, updating the tree and calculating the minimum distances. The formula used in the loop correctly accounts for the relative positions and speeds of the points.

5. **Output**: The final result is printed, which is the sum of the minimum distances over all pairs of points.

Given the complexity of the problem and the efficient implementation of the solution, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. No obvious edge cases or logical errors were identified that would cause the program to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
