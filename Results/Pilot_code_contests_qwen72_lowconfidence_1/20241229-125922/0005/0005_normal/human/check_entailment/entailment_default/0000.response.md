Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The primary issue lies in the function `func_1`, which is intended to handle input but does not actually process the input as described in the problem. Instead, it redirects the standard output and input streams, which is not relevant to the problem of calculating the sum of minimum distances between all pairs of moving points.

The function `func_1` is defined to redirect the standard output to a `BytesIO` object and return a method to read lines from the standard input. This function does not accept any parameters and does not process the points, their coordinates, or their speeds. As a result, the input handling is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

Additionally, the main logic of the program, which involves calculating the minimum distances between pairs of points, is complex and relies on the correct input handling. Since the input is not processed correctly, the rest of the program cannot function as intended.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
