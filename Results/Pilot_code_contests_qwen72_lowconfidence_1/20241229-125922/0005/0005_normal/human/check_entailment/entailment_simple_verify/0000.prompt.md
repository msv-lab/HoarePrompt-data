You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n points on a coordinate axis OX. The i-th point is located at the integer point x_i and has a speed v_i. It is guaranteed that no two points occupy the same coordinate. All n points move with the constant speed, the coordinate of the i-th point at the moment t (t can be non-integer) is calculated as x_i + t ⋅ v_i.

Consider two points i and j. Let d(i, j) be the minimum possible distance between these two points over any possible moments of time (even non-integer). It means that if two points i and j coincide at some moment, the value d(i, j) will be 0.

Your task is to calculate the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of points.

The second line of the input contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8), where x_i is the initial coordinate of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that all x_i are distinct.

The third line of the input contains n integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_n (-10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8), where v_i is the speed of the i-th point.

Output

Print one integer — the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for calculating the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points moving along a coordinate axis with constant speeds. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program reads the input and sorts the points based on their coordinates and speeds. This ensures that the points are processed in a meaningful order for the calculation of minimum distances.

2. **Order Tree Implementation**: The `order_tree` class is used to efficiently manage and query the positions and counts of points. The tree structure allows for fast updates and queries, which is crucial for handling up to \(2 \times 10^5\) points.

3. **Query and Update Methods**: The `query` method calculates the sum and count of points up to a given index, while the `update` method updates the tree with new values. These methods ensure that the program can efficiently compute the required sums and counts.

4. **Main Loop**: The main loop iterates over the points in reverse order, updating the tree and calculating the minimum distances. The formula used in the loop correctly accounts for the relative positions and speeds of the points.

5. **Output**: The final result is printed, which is the sum of the minimum distances over all pairs of points.

Given the complexity of the problem and the efficient implementation of the solution, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. No obvious edge cases or logical errors were identified that would cause the program to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
