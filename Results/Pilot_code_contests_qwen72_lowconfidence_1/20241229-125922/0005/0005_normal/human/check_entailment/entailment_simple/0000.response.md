Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program is intended to solve the problem described, but there are several issues that prevent it from being fully correct:

1. **Function Definition Issue**:
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly defined to accept the input parameters as specified in the problem description. The problem requires reading input from standard input, but the function `func_1` is defined in a way that it returns a method for reading lines from a `BytesIO` object. This is not aligned with the expected input handling for the problem.
   - A correct function definition should be something like:
     ```python
     def func_1():
         import sys
         input = sys.stdin.readline
         return input
     ```
   - Alternatively, the program could directly use `sys.stdin.readline` without defining `func_1`.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `input = func_1()`, which sets `input` to a method for reading lines from a `BytesIO` object. This is not the same as using `sys.stdin.readline` directly, which is the typical way to handle input in Python for such problems.
   - The correct way to handle input should be:
     ```python
     input = sys.stdin.readline
     ```

3. **Logical Issues**:
   - The program uses a custom `order_tree` class to manage the order and updates of the points. However, the logic inside the `order_tree` class and the main loop is complex and might not be straightforward to verify for correctness without a deep dive into the implementation.
   - The program's logic for calculating the minimum distances and summing them up needs to be carefully verified to ensure it matches the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases such as:
     - When all points have the same speed.
     - When the points are initially very close to each other.
     - When the points are moving in opposite directions.
   - The current implementation does not clearly demonstrate how it handles these edge cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description due to the incorrect function definition and input handling. Additionally, the logic inside the `order_tree` class and the main loop is complex and may not be correct without further verification. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
