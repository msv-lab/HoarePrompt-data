Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description due to several issues:

1. **Function Definition Issue**: The function `func_1` is not correctly defined to accept the required parameters. The function should accept `n`, `x`, and `v` as inputs, but it does not. Instead, it redefines the standard output stream and returns a method to read lines from standard input. This is incorrect and does not align with the problem's input handling requirements.

2. **Input Handling**: The program uses `sys.stdin` and `BytesIO` to handle input, which is unnecessary and does not match the typical input handling expected in such problems. The standard approach would be to use `input()` to read from the standard input directly.

3. **Algorithmic Logic**: The logic used in the program involves a custom data structure `order_tree` and operations on it. While the logic might be correct in terms of the algorithm, the implementation is obfuscated and does not clearly show how it computes the minimum distances between pairs of points over time. The problem description requires a clear and understandable solution to compute the sum of minimum distances, and the current implementation does not meet this clarity requirement.

4. **Output Handling**: The program should print the result directly, but the redirection of standard output to a `BytesIO` object complicates the output handling and is not necessary for solving the problem.

### Why the Program Does Not Follow the Problem Description

- **Incorrect Function Definition**: The function `func_1` does not take the required inputs and does not perform the necessary operations to solve the problem.
- **Complex and Obfuscated Logic**: The use of a custom data structure and the complex logic inside the `order_tree` class make it difficult to verify the correctness of the program without a deep understanding of the underlying algorithm.
- **Unnecessary Input/Output Redirection**: The redirection of standard input and output streams is unnecessary and complicates the program, making it harder to understand and verify.

To make the program correct, it should be rewritten to clearly handle the input, compute the minimum distances between pairs of points, and print the result. The function should accept the number of points, their initial coordinates, and their speeds as inputs and return the sum of minimum distances.
