The function `func_1` is not properly defined for the given problem. The function should accept parameters that represent the number of points, their initial coordinates, and their speeds. A correct function definition would be: `def func_1(n, x, v):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of points (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers representing the initial coordinates of the points (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8), and `v` is a list of integers representing the speeds of the points (-10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8).
