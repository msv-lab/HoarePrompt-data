The code snippet changes the standard output stream to a `BytesIO` object. This means that any print statements or outputs that would normally go to the console will now be directed to this in-memory binary stream. The function `func_1` and its parameters (`n`, `x`, `v`) are not affected by this code snippet, and their definitions remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is not properly defined for the given problem. The function should accept parameters that represent the number of points, their initial coordinates, and their speeds. A correct function definition would be: `def func_1(n, x, v):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of points (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers representing the initial coordinates of the points (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8), and `v` is a list of integers representing the speeds of the points (-10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8). `sys.stdout` is now a `BytesIO` object.**
