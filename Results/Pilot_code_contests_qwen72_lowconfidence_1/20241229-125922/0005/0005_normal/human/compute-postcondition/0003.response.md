The function `func_1` should accept three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `v`. `n` is an integer representing the number of points, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. `x` is a list of integers representing the initial coordinates of the points, where each coordinate \( x_i \) satisfies 1 ≤ \( x_i \) ≤ 10^8. `v` is a list of integers representing the speeds of the points, where each speed \( v_i \) satisfies -10^8 ≤ \( v_i \) ≤ 10^8.

However, the provided function definition does not match this description. The function `func_1` as defined does not accept any parameters and instead reads a line from a `BytesIO` object, which contains the content read from file descriptor 0 (standard input).

Given the intended parameters and the actual behavior, the correct functionality description should focus on the intended parameters:

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of points, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `x` (a list of integers representing the initial coordinates of the points, where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8), and `v` (a list of integers representing the speeds of the points, where -10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8). However, the function as defined does not accept any parameters and instead reads a line from a `BytesIO` object, which contains the content read from file descriptor 0 (standard input).**
