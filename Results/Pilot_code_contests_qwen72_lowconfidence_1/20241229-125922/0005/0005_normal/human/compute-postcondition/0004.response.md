Functionality: ** The function `func_1` is intended to accept three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of points, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `x` (a list of integers representing the initial coordinates of the points, where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8), and `v` (a list of integers representing the speeds of the points, where -10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8). However, the function as defined does not accept any parameters and instead redefines the standard output stream to a `BytesIO` object. It then returns a method that reads a line from a `BytesIO` object, which contains the content read from file descriptor 0 (standard input) up to the size of the file. The function does not process the points, their coordinates, or their speeds in any way. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, and the returned method can be used to read lines from the standard input. **

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Missing Parameters:** The function does not accept the required parameters (`n`, `x`, `v`), which means it cannot perform any operations related to the points, their coordinates, or their speeds.
- **Output Redirection:** The standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, which may affect any subsequent print statements or logging in the program.
- **Input Reading:** The function returns a method to read a line from the standard input, but it does not process or use the input in any meaningful way within the function itself.
- **No Processing Logic:** The function lacks any logic to handle the points, their coordinates, or their speeds, which is likely a significant omission based on the intended purpose described in the annotations.
