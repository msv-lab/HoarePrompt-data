Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It uses dynamic programming to determine whether the current player can force a win from any given number of stones. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input correctly using a custom `input` function that reads from standard input and processes it into the required variables `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with `False` values, indicating that initially, no positions are winning positions. This is correct because the base case is that having 0 stones is a losing position.

3. **Base Case Handling**: For each element `ai` in the set `a`, the position `dp[ai]` is marked as `True` because if the current player can take exactly `ai` stones, they win immediately.

4. **DP Table Filling**: The program iterates over the range from `max(a) + 1` to `k + 1` and updates the `dp` array. For each position `i`, it checks if there is any move `ai` such that the resulting position `i - ai` is a losing position (`not dp[i - ai]`). If such a move exists, `dp[i]` is set to `True`, indicating that the current player can force a win from this position.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints `First` if `dp[k]` is `True` (Taro wins), and `Second` otherwise (Jiro wins).

The program handles all constraints and edge cases correctly, and the logic aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
