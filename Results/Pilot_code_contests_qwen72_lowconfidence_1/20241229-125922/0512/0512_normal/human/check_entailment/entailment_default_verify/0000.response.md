Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to determine the winner of the game. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `N` and `K` from standard input, followed by a list `a` of `N` unique integers. This aligns with the problem description and the constraints.

2. **DP Array Initialization**: The program initializes a DP array `dp` of length `K + 1` with all elements set to `False`. This array is used to track whether the current player can force a win with `i` stones remaining.

3. **Initial Moves**: For each integer `ai` in `a`, the program sets `dp[ai]` to `True`. This step correctly marks the positions where the player can immediately win by removing exactly `ai` stones.

4. **DP Table Update**: The program iterates from `max(a) + 1` to `K` and updates the DP table. For each position `i`, it sets `dp[i]` to `True` if there exists at least one `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`. This step ensures that the program correctly identifies positions where the current player can force a win by making a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position.

5. **Final Result**: The program writes 'First' to standard output if `dp[K]` is `True`, indicating that Taro can force a win, and 'Second' otherwise, indicating that Jiro can force a win. This aligns with the problem's requirement to determine the winner based on the initial number of stones `K`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `K` is less than or equal to the maximum value in `a`, or when `a` contains only one element. These cases are correctly managed by the dynamic programming approach.

The output hints confirm that the program behaves as expected, and the provided examples and constraints are correctly handled. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
