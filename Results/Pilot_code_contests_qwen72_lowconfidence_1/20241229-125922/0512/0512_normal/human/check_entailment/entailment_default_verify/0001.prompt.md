You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a set A = \\{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N \\} consisting of N positive integers. Taro and Jiro will play the following game against each other.

Initially, we have a pile consisting of K stones. The two players perform the following operation alternately, starting from Taro:

* Choose an element x in A, and remove exactly x stones from the pile.



A player loses when he becomes unable to play. Assuming that both players play optimally, determine the winner.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_N \leq K

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
a_1 a_2 \ldots a_N


Output

If Taro will win, print `First`; if Jiro will win, print `Second`.

    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True
    for i in xrange(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It uses dynamic programming to determine whether the current player can force a win from any given number of stones. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input correctly using a custom `input` function that reads from standard input and processes it into the required variables `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with `False` values, indicating that initially, no positions are winning positions. This is correct because the base case is that having 0 stones is a losing position.

3. **Base Case Handling**: For each element `ai` in the set `a`, the position `dp[ai]` is marked as `True` because if the current player can take exactly `ai` stones, they win immediately.

4. **DP Table Filling**: The program iterates over the range from `max(a) + 1` to `k + 1` and updates the `dp` array. For each position `i`, it checks if there is any move `ai` such that the resulting position `i - ai` is a losing position (`not dp[i - ai]`). If such a move exists, `dp[i]` is set to `True`, indicating that the current player can force a win from this position.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints `First` if `dp[k]` is `True` (Taro wins), and `Second` otherwise (Jiro wins).

The program handles all constraints and edge cases correctly, and the logic aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers `N` and `K` from standard input, followed by a list `a` of `N` unique integers. It then initializes a list `dp` of length `K + 1` with all elements set to `False`. For each integer `ai` in `a`, it sets `dp[ai]` to `True`. Afterward, for each integer `i` from `max(a) + 1` to `K`, it sets `dp[i]` to `True` if there exists at least one `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`. Finally, it writes 'First' to standard output if `dp[K]` is `True`, otherwise it writes 'Second'. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include scenarios where `K` is less than or equal to the maximum value in `a`, or when `a` contains only one element.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
