You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a set A = \\{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N \\} consisting of N positive integers. Taro and Jiro will play the following game against each other.

Initially, we have a pile consisting of K stones. The two players perform the following operation alternately, starting from Taro:

* Choose an element x in A, and remove exactly x stones from the pile.



A player loses when he becomes unable to play. Assuming that both players play optimally, determine the winner.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_N \leq K

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
a_1 a_2 \ldots a_N


Output

If Taro will win, print `First`; if Jiro will win, print `Second`.

    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())

    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True
    for i in xrange(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The program initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` indicates whether the player whose turn it is can force a win with `i` stones remaining. The program correctly updates the DP table for each possible move (each element in the set `A`) and determines the final result based on the state of `dp[k]`. The program handles all the constraints and test cases provided in the problem description, and it follows the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import os
from io import BytesIO

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5. a is a list of N unique integers where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N ≤ K.
def func():
    input = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` and `K` are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` where each element at index `i` is `True` if `i` is present in `a` and `False` otherwise.
    for i in xrange(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` and `K` are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` where each element at index `i` is `True` if `i` is present in `a` or if there exists at least one `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`, and `False` otherwise for `i` in the range `[max(a) + 1, k]`, and `False` for `i` in the range `[0, max(a)]`.
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `N` and `K` from standard input, followed by a list `a` of `N` unique integers. It then initializes a list `dp` of length `K + 1` with all elements set to `False`. For each integer `ai` in `a`, it sets `dp[ai]` to `True`. Afterward, for each integer `i` from `max(a) + 1` to `K`, it sets `dp[i]` to `True` if there exists at least one `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`. Finally, it writes 'First' to standard output if `dp[K]` is `True`, otherwise it writes 'Second'. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include scenarios where `K` is less than or equal to the maximum value in `a`, or when `a` contains only one element.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
