Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem described. Here are the issues:

1. **Use of `xrange` instead of `range`:**
   - The program uses `xrange` in the second for-loop, which is not available in Python 3. In Python 3, `range` should be used instead. This will cause a NameError in Python 3 environments.

2. **Incorrect Initialization and Update of `dp` Array:**
   - The dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized correctly, but the update logic is flawed. Specifically, the first for-loop only sets `dp[ai]` to `True` for each `ai` in `a`, which is correct for the initial positions. However, the second for-loop should start from `min(a)` instead of `max(a) + 1` because the smallest move can affect the game state from the beginning.

3. **Handling of Small `K` Values:**
   - The program does not handle small values of `K` correctly. For example, if `K` is less than the smallest element in `a`, the program will incorrectly set `dp[K]` to `False` without considering the initial state.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a if i - ai >= 0)
    
    print('First' if dp[k] else 'Second')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `N` and `K` from the standard input and then reads the list `a` of `N` integers.
   
2. **Initialization of `dp` Array:**
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `False` values, representing that the game is lost if no moves are possible.

3. **Dynamic Programming Update:**
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `k`, updating the `dp` array. For each position `i`, it checks if there is any move `ai` such that the state `dp[i - ai]` is `False`. If such a move exists, `dp[i]` is set to `True`, indicating that the current player can force a win.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'First' if `dp[k]` is `True`, indicating that Taro can win. Otherwise, it prints 'Second', indicating that Jiro will win.

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all edge cases.
