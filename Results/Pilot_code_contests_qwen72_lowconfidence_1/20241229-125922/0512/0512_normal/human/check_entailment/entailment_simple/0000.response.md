Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of elements `N` and the initial number of stones `K` from the input, followed by the list of integers `a`. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The program initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of size `k + 1` with all elements set to `False`. This array will be used to track whether a player can force a win starting from a given number of stones.

3. **Base Case Initialization**: For each element `ai` in the list `a`, the program sets `dp[ai]` to `True`. This means that if the number of stones is exactly `ai`, the current player can always win by removing `ai` stones.

4. **DP Table Filling**: The program then iterates over the range from `max(a) + 1` to `k + 1` and updates the `dp` array. For each index `i`, it checks if there is any `ai` in the list `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`. If such an `ai` exists, it means the current player can remove `ai` stones and leave the opponent in a losing position, so `dp[i]` is set to `True`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program checks the value of `dp[k]`. If `dp[k]` is `True`, it prints "First" indicating that Taro (the first player) can force a win. Otherwise, it prints "Second" indicating that Jiro (the second player) can force a win.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that it always determines the winner based on optimal play. Therefore, the program is correct.
