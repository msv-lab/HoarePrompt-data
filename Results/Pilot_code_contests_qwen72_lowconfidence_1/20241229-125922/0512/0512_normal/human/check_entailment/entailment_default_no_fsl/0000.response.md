Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case according to the problem description:

1. **Use of `xrange`**: The program uses `xrange`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `xrange` has been replaced by `range`. This means the program will not run correctly in Python 3 environments, which is a common environment for modern Python code.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program initializes the `dp` array and sets `dp[ai]` to `True` for each `ai` in `a`. However, it does not handle the case where `K` is less than the smallest element in `a`. According to the problem description, if `K` is less than the smallest element in `a`, Taro cannot make a move and Jiro wins immediately. The current implementation does not explicitly handle this case, although it might work correctly due to the initialization of `dp`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The dynamic programming logic is mostly correct, but the initialization and the range of the loop might be problematic. Specifically, the loop starts from `max(a) + 1` to `K + 1`, which might skip some necessary states. The correct approach should initialize `dp[0]` to `False` (since no stones means the player who is about to move loses) and then iterate from `1` to `K`.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    dp[0] = False  # No stones means the player who is about to move loses
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for ai in a:
            if i - ai >= 0 and not dp[i - ai]:
                dp[i] = True
                break
    print('First' if dp[k] else 'Second')
```

This version ensures that:
- The program uses `range` instead of `xrange` to be compatible with Python 3.
- The `dp` array is correctly initialized with `dp[0] = False`.
- The loop iterates from `1` to `k`, ensuring all states are considered.
- The program handles the case where `K` is less than the smallest element in `a` correctly.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness is **False**.
