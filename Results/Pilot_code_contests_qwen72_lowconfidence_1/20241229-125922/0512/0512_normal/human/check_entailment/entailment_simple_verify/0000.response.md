Final: **True**

**Reasoning:**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the program. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of elements `N` and the initial number of stones `K` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of integers `a` which represents the set of possible moves.
   - The program initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of length `k + 1` with all values set to `False`. This array will be used to track whether the player whose turn it is can force a win with `i` stones remaining.

2. **Setting Initial States:**
   - For each element `ai` in the list `a`, the program sets `dp[ai]` to `True`. This means that if the number of stones left is exactly `ai`, the current player can always win by removing `ai` stones.

3. **Dynamic Programming Update:**
   - The program iterates over the range from `max(a) + 1` to `k + 1` and updates the DP array. For each index `i`, it checks if there exists any `ai` in the list `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`. If such an `ai` exists, it sets `dp[i]` to `True`, indicating that the current player can force a win by removing `ai` stones.
   - This ensures that the DP array correctly reflects the winning and losing positions for all possible numbers of stones from `0` to `k`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - After populating the DP array, the program checks the value of `dp[k]`. If `dp[k]` is `True`, it prints "First" indicating that Taro can force a win. Otherwise, it prints "Second" indicating that Jiro will win.

The annotations confirm that the program correctly initializes and updates the DP array according to the problem's requirements. The constraints and input format are handled appropriately, and the program follows the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases as per the problem description.
