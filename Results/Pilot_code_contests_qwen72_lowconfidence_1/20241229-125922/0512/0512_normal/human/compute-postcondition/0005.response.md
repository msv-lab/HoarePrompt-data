The code snippet `dp[ai] = True` updates the value at index `ai` in the list `dp` to `True`. The values of `N`, `K`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. The list `dp` now has its element at index `ai` set to `True`, while all other elements remain `False`.

Output State: **`N` and `K` are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input and must contain at least one element, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with all elements set to `False` except `dp[ai]` which is `True`.**
