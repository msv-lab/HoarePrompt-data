The code snippet `dp[ai] = True` does not change the value of `dp[ai]` because `dp[ai]` is already `True` according to the initial state. Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[ai]` is `True`, `ai` is the next (second) element in the list `a`, the list `a` must have at least two more elements.**
