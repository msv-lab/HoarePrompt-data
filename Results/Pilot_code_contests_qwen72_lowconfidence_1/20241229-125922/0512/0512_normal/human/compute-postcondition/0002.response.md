The line of code reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns it to the list `a`.

- The initial state specifies that `N` and `K` are integers within certain ranges, and `a` is a list of `N` unique integers sorted in ascending order, with each element within the range 1 to `K`.
- After executing the code, the list `a` is updated with new values based on the input. These values will replace the initial values of `a` specified in the initial state.

Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `a`. However, we can state that `a` now contains a list of integers as provided by the user input.

The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged, as they are only read from standard input but not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **N and K are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input.**
