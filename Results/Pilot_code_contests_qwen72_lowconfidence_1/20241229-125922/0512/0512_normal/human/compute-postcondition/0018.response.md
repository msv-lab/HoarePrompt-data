The code snippet provided writes either 'First' or 'Second' to the standard output based on the value of `dp[k]`. Here's the detailed analysis:

- The value of `dp[k]` determines what is written to the standard output. If `dp[k]` is `True`, 'First' is written; if `dp[k]` is `False`, 'Second' is written.
- The variables `N`, `K`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are not modified by this code snippet.
- The list `dp` is not modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` and `K` are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` where each element at index `i` is `True` if `i` is present in `a` or if there exists at least one `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`, and `False` otherwise for `i` in the range `[max(a) + 1, k]`, and `False` for `i` in the range `[0, max(a)]`. 'First' or 'Second' is written to the standard output based on the value of `dp[k]`.**
