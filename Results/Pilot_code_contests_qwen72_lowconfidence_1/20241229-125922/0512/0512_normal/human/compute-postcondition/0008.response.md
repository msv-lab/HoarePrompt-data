According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[ai]` is `True`, `ai` is the next element in the list `a`, and the list `a` must have at least one more element. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least two more elements, and `ai` will be the next (second) element in the remaining part of the list.

State: **`dp[ai]` is `True`, `ai` is the next (second) element in the list `a`, the list `a` must have at least two more elements.**
