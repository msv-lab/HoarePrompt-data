To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to run:

1. **Range Condition**: The loop iterates from `max(a) + 1` to `k + 1`. For the loop to execute, `max(a) + 1` must be less than or equal to `k`.
2. **Initialization**: The variable `i` should start at `max(a) + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` and `K` are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5.
- `n` is an integer read from standard input.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` where each element at index `i` is `True` if `i` is present in `a` and `False` otherwise.

Let's adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

1. **Ensure `max(a) + 1` is less than or equal to `k`**: This is necessary for the loop to have iterations.
2. **Initialize `i` to `max(a) + 1`**: This is the starting point of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
- `N` and `K` are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5.
- `n` is an integer read from standard input.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` where each element at index `i` is `True` if `i` is present in `a` and `False` otherwise.
- `max(a) + 1` must be less than or equal to `k`.
- `i` is initialized to `max(a) + 1`.

State: **`N` and `K` are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` where each element at index `i` is `True` if `i` is present in `a` and `False` otherwise, `max(a) + 1` must be less than or equal to `k`, `i` is initialized to `max(a) + 1`**
