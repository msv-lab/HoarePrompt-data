The function `func` does not explicitly show its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it's implied that the function should accept three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `a`. 

- `N` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`, with the constraint 1 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `K` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `N` unique integers, where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N ≤ K.

Since the output is not specified in the problem statement, I cannot provide a definitive return value. However, typically, a function with such parameters might return some value based on the list `a` and the integers `N` and `K`.

For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume the function returns a specific value or object related to the list `a` and the integers `N` and `K`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `N`, an integer indicating the number of elements in the list `a` (1 ≤ N ≤ 100); `K`, an integer (1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5); and `a`, a list of `N` unique integers sorted in ascending order (1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N ≤ K). The function returns a value based on the input parameters.**
