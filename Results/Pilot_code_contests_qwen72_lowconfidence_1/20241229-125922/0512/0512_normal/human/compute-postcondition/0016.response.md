Initial State:
- `N` and `K` are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5.
- `n` is an integer read from standard input.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` where each element at index `i` is `True` if `i` is present in `a` and `False` otherwise.
- `max(a) + 1` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `i` is currently `max(a) + 3`.
- `dp[i]` is `True` if any `dp[i - ai]` for `ai` in `a` is `False`, otherwise `dp[i]` is `False`.

Code Snippet:
```python
dp[i] = any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)
```

Step-by-Step Impact Analysis:
1. **Variable `dp[i]` Update**:
   - The value of `dp[i]` is updated based on the condition `any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)`.
   - This means `dp[i]` will be `True` if any of the values `dp[i - ai]` for `ai` in `a` is `False`.
   - Otherwise, `dp[i]` will be `False`.

2. **Check Previous Values**:
   - `i` is currently `max(a) + 3`.
   - `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with boolean values.

3. **Calculate the Result**:
   - For each `ai` in `a`, evaluate `dp[i - ai]`.
   - If any of these evaluations result in `False`, set `dp[i]` to `True`.
   - Otherwise, set `dp[i]` to `False`.

Output State:
- `N` and `K` are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5.
- `n` is an integer read from standard input.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` where each element at index `i` is `True` if `i` is present in `a` and `False` otherwise.
- `max(a) + 1` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `i` is `max(a) + 3`.
- `dp[max(a) + 3]` is `True` if any `dp[max(a) + 3 - ai]` for `ai` in `a` is `False`, otherwise `dp[max(a) + 3]` is `False`.
