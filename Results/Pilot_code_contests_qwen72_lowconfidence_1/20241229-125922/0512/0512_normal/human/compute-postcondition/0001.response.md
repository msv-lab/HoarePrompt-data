The code snippet reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, and maps them to integers, assigning the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`.

- `input()` now reads a line from standard input.
- The line is split into two parts and converted to integers.
- The first integer is assigned to `n`.
- The second integer is assigned to `k`.

The values of `N`, `K`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **N and K are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5. a is a list of N unique integers where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N ≤ K. `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input.**
