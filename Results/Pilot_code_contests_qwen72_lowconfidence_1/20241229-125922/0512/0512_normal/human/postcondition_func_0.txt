The function reads two integers `N` and `K` from standard input, followed by a list `a` of `N` unique integers. It then initializes a list `dp` of length `K + 1` with all elements set to `False`. For each integer `ai` in `a`, it sets `dp[ai]` to `True`. Afterward, for each integer `i` from `max(a) + 1` to `K`, it sets `dp[i]` to `True` if there exists at least one `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`. Finally, it writes 'First' to standard output if `dp[K]` is `True`, otherwise it writes 'Second'. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include scenarios where `K` is less than or equal to the maximum value in `a`, or when `a` contains only one element.
