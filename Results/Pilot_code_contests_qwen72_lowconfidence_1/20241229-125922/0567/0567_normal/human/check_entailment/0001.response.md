Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is equal to `n`. In such a scenario, the loop `for i in range(k, n + 1):` will only run once with `i` equal to `n`, but the inner loop `for j in range(i, n):` will not run at all because `j` starts from `i` and goes up to `n-1`, which means the loop body is never executed. As a result, `cur_max` remains uninitialized for the final segment of length `n`, leading to incorrect computation of the maximum average temperature.

To illustrate, consider the input:
```
4 4
3 4 1 2
```
The program will not correctly compute the average temperature for the entire segment [3, 4, 1, 2], and thus the output will be incorrect.
