Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input for Python 3**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is a function from Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. Using `raw_input()` in Python 3 will result in a NameError. To make the program compatible with Python 3, `raw_input()` should be replaced with `input()`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Average**: The program calculates the maximum average of segments of length `i` starting from `k` to `n`. However, it does not correctly handle the calculation of the maximum average for segments of length `k` to `n` as required by the problem. Specifically, the inner loop that updates `cur` and `cur_max` is only iterating from `i` to `n`, which means it is not considering all possible segments of length `k` to `n`.

3. **Inefficient Calculation**: The program recalculates the sum of segments multiple times, which can be optimized using a sliding window approach to maintain the sum of the current segment and update it efficiently.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    max_avg = 0
    
    # Calculate the initial sum of the first k elements
    cur_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = cur_sum
    max_avg = cur_sum / k
    
    # Use a sliding window to calculate the sum of all segments of length k to n
    for i in range(k, n):
        cur_sum = cur_sum - arr[i - k] + arr[i]
        if cur_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = cur_sum
        if cur_sum / k > max_avg:
            max_avg = cur_sum / k
    
    # Print the maximum average
    print(max_avg)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` to read input, which is compatible with Python 3.
- **Sliding Window**: The program uses a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the sum of segments of length `k` to `n`. It maintains the current sum of the segment and updates it by subtracting the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the new element that is sliding into the window.
- **Maximum Average Calculation**: The program keeps track of the maximum average of any segment of length `k` to `n` and updates it whenever a higher average is found.

This corrected program will correctly compute the heat intensity value as described in the problem statement.
