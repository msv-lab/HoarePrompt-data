You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The heat during the last few days has been really intense. Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.

Mathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:

Suppose we want to analyze the segment of n consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these n days; the temperature during i-th day equals a_i.

We denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day x to day y, we calculate it as \frac{∑ _{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1} (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than k consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures [3, 4, 1, 2] and k = 3, we are interested in segments [3, 4, 1], [4, 1, 2] and [3, 4, 1, 2] (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).

You have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. Are you up to this task?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the number of days in the given period, and the minimum number of days in a segment we consider when calculating heat intensity value, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000) — the temperature measures during given n days.

Output

Print one real number — the heat intensity value, i. e., the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than k consecutive days.

Your answer will be considered correct if the following condition holds: |res - res_0| < 10^{-6}, where res is your answer, and res_0 is the answer given by the jury's solution.

Example

Input

4 3
3 4 1 2


Output

2.666666666666667
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split())
    max_avg = 0
    for i in range(k, n + 1):
        cur = sum(arr[:i])
        cur_max = cur
        for j in range(i, n):
            cur = cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]
            if cur > cur_max:
                cur_max = cur
        if cur_max / float(i) > max_avg:
            max_avg = cur_max / float(i)
    print(max_avg)


```
Output hints: The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then calculates the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length between `k` and `n` (inclusive). The function prints this maximum average to the standard output. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original values of `n` and `k`, the list `arr`, and the calculated maximum average. Note that the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include scenarios where `k` equals `n` (the entire array is considered), and when `k` is 1 (every single element is a subarray of length 1). The function handles these cases correctly. However, the function does not validate the input constraints (e.g., ensuring `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000`), which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is invalid.

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
