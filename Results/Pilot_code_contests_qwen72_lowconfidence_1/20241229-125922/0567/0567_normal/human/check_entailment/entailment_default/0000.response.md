Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct for every potential case:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers `arr`. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `max_avg` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum average temperature found.

3. **Sliding Window Calculation**:
   - The outer loop iterates over all possible segment lengths from `k` to `n`.
   - For each segment length `i`, the initial sum of the first `i` elements is calculated and stored in `cur`.
   - The inner loop then slides the window of length `i` across the array, updating the sum `cur` by subtracting the element that is leaving the window and adding the new element entering the window.
   - The maximum sum for the current segment length `i` is tracked in `cur_max`.

4. **Average Calculation**:
   - After finding the maximum sum for the current segment length, the average is calculated by dividing `cur_max` by `i` and converted to a floating-point number using `float(i)`.
   - If this average is greater than the current `max_avg`, `max_avg` is updated.

5. **Output**: The final maximum average temperature is printed to the standard output.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k` equals `n`, the entire array is considered as a single segment, and the average of the entire array is calculated.
   - When `k` is 1, every single element is considered as a segment of length 1, and the maximum temperature is simply the maximum element in the array.

The program handles these edge cases correctly and does not violate any constraints specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
