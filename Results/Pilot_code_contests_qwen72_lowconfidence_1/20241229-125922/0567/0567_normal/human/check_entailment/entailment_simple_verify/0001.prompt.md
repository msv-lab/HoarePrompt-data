You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The heat during the last few days has been really intense. Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.

Mathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:

Suppose we want to analyze the segment of n consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these n days; the temperature during i-th day equals a_i.

We denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day x to day y, we calculate it as \frac{∑ _{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1} (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than k consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures [3, 4, 1, 2] and k = 3, we are interested in segments [3, 4, 1], [4, 1, 2] and [3, 4, 1, 2] (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).

You have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. Are you up to this task?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the number of days in the given period, and the minimum number of days in a segment we consider when calculating heat intensity value, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000) — the temperature measures during given n days.

Output

Print one real number — the heat intensity value, i. e., the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than k consecutive days.

Your answer will be considered correct if the following condition holds: |res - res_0| < 10^{-6}, where res is your answer, and res_0 is the answer given by the jury's solution.

Example

Input

4 3
3 4 1 2


Output

2.666666666666667
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split())
    max_avg = 0
    for i in range(k, n + 1):
        cur = sum(arr[:i])
        cur_max = cur
        for j in range(i, n):
            cur = cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]
            if cur > cur_max:
                cur_max = cur
        if cur_max / float(i) > max_avg:
            max_avg = cur_max / float(i)
    print(max_avg)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is equal to `n`. In such a scenario, the loop `for i in range(k, n + 1):` will only run once with `i` equal to `n`, but the inner loop `for j in range(i, n):` will not run at all because `j` starts from `i` and goes up to `n-1`, which means the loop body is never executed. As a result, `cur_max` remains uninitialized for the final segment of length `n`, leading to incorrect computation of the maximum average temperature.

To illustrate, consider the input:
```
4 4
3 4 1 2
```
The program will not correctly compute the average temperature for the entire segment [3, 4, 1, 2], and thus the output will be incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000, and a is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split())
    max_avg = 0
    for i in range(k, n + 1):
        cur = sum(arr[:i])
        
        cur_max = cur
        
        for j in range(i, n):
            cur = cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]
            if cur > cur_max:
                cur_max = cur
        
        if cur_max / float(i) > max_avg:
            max_avg = cur_max / float(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `arr`, `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `n` in `arr`. `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` to `n` in `arr`.
    print(max_avg)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
