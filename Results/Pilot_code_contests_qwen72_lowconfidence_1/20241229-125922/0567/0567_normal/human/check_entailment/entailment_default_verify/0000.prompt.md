You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The heat during the last few days has been really intense. Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.

Mathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:

Suppose we want to analyze the segment of n consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these n days; the temperature during i-th day equals a_i.

We denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day x to day y, we calculate it as \frac{∑ _{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1} (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than k consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures [3, 4, 1, 2] and k = 3, we are interested in segments [3, 4, 1], [4, 1, 2] and [3, 4, 1, 2] (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).

You have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. Are you up to this task?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the number of days in the given period, and the minimum number of days in a segment we consider when calculating heat intensity value, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000) — the temperature measures during given n days.

Output

Print one real number — the heat intensity value, i. e., the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than k consecutive days.

Your answer will be considered correct if the following condition holds: |res - res_0| < 10^{-6}, where res is your answer, and res_0 is the answer given by the jury's solution.

        cur = sum(arr[:i])
        cur_max = cur
        for j in range(i, n):
            cur = cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]
            if cur > cur_max:
                cur_max = cur
        if cur_max / float(i) > max_avg:
            max_avg = cur_max / float(i)
    print(max_avg)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. It calculates the heat intensity value by iterating through all possible segments of the array that are at least `k` days long, computing their average temperatures, and keeping track of the maximum average temperature found.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:
- The program reads the input values `n`, `k`, and the temperature array `arr`.
- It initializes `max_avg` to 0, which will store the maximum average temperature.
- It iterates over all possible segment lengths from `k` to `n`.
- For each segment length, it computes the initial sum of the first `i` elements.
- It then slides a window of size `i` across the array, updating the sum by subtracting the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that enters the window.
- It keeps track of the maximum sum (`cur_max`) for the current segment length.
- After processing all windows of the current length, it updates `max_avg` if the current maximum sum divided by the segment length is greater than the current `max_avg`.
- Finally, it prints the `max_avg`.

The program handles all edge cases, such as when `k` is equal to `n`, and it correctly computes the maximum average temperature for all valid segments. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then calculates the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length between `k` and `n` (inclusive). The function prints this maximum average to the standard output. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original values of `n` and `k`, the list `arr`, and the calculated maximum average. Note that the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include scenarios where `k` equals `n` (the entire array is considered), and when `k` is 1 (every single element is a subarray of length 1). The function handles these cases correctly. However, the function does not validate the input constraints (e.g., ensuring `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000`), which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is invalid.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
