Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. Since the problem does not specify the version of Python, using `raw_input()` could lead to issues if the program is run in a Python 3 environment. This is a significant issue because most modern systems use Python 3.

2. **Handling of Subarrays**: The program correctly calculates the maximum average of subarrays of lengths from `k` to `n`. However, it does not handle the case where the subarray length is exactly `k` correctly. The inner loop should start from `i = k` and go up to `n`, but the initialization of `cur` and `cur_max` should be done outside the loop to avoid recalculating the sum for each subarray length.

3. **Edge Cases**: While the program handles the edge cases where `k` equals `n` and `k` equals 1, it does not handle the case where `n` is very large (up to 5000) efficiently. The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2), which can be improved to O(n) using a sliding window approach.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues mentioned:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the sum of the first k elements
    cur_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_avg = cur_sum / k
    
    # Use a sliding window to calculate the sum of each subarray of length k
    for i in range(k, n):
        cur_sum = cur_sum - arr[i - k] + arr[i]
        max_avg = max(max_avg, cur_sum / k)
    
    # Print the maximum average
    print(max_avg)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Version:
- **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` instead of `raw_input()` to ensure compatibility with Python 3.
- **Sliding Window**: The program uses a sliding window to efficiently calculate the sum of each subarray of length `k` in O(n) time.
- **Maximum Average Calculation**: The program correctly updates the maximum average as it iterates through the array.

### Conclusion:
The original program does not meet the requirements of the problem description due to the issues mentioned. The corrected version addresses these issues and correctly computes the heat intensity value as required. Therefore, the original program is **incorrect**.
