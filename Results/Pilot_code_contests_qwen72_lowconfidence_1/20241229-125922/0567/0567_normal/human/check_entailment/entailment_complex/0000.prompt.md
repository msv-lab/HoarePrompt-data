You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The heat during the last few days has been really intense. Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.

Mathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:

Suppose we want to analyze the segment of n consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these n days; the temperature during i-th day equals a_i.

We denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day x to day y, we calculate it as \frac{∑ _{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1} (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than k consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures [3, 4, 1, 2] and k = 3, we are interested in segments [3, 4, 1], [4, 1, 2] and [3, 4, 1, 2] (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).

You have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. Are you up to this task?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the number of days in the given period, and the minimum number of days in a segment we consider when calculating heat intensity value, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000) — the temperature measures during given n days.

Output

Print one real number — the heat intensity value, i. e., the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than k consecutive days.

Your answer will be considered correct if the following condition holds: |res - res_0| < 10^{-6}, where res is your answer, and res_0 is the answer given by the jury's solution.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000, and a is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split())
    max_avg = 0
    for i in range(k, n + 1):
        cur = sum(arr[:i])
        
        cur_max = cur
        
        for j in range(i, n):
            cur = cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]
            if cur > cur_max:
                cur_max = cur
        
        if cur_max / float(i) > max_avg:
            max_avg = cur_max / float(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `arr`, `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `n` in `arr`. `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` to `n` in `arr`.
    print(max_avg)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then calculates the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length between `k` and `n` (inclusive). The function prints this maximum average to the standard output. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original values of `n` and `k`, the list `arr`, and the calculated maximum average. Note that the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include scenarios where `k` equals `n` (the entire array is considered), and when `k` is 1 (every single element is a subarray of length 1). The function handles these cases correctly. However, the function does not validate the input constraints (e.g., ensuring `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000`), which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is invalid.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
