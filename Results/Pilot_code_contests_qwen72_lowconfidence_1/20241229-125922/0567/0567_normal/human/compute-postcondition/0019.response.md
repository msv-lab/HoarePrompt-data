To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop operates and the transformations applied to the variables within the loop. Let's break down the loop and its effects:

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input.
- `max_avg` is 0.
- `i` is `k`.
- `cur` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`.
- `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the range from `i` to `n`, updating `cur` and potentially `cur_max`:
```python
for j in range(i, n):
    cur = cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]
    if cur > cur_max:
        cur_max = cur
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `i < n`. Given `i` starts as `k`, the loop will execute if `k < n`.
2. **Update of `cur`**: For each iteration, `cur` is updated by subtracting the element that is being removed from the window (`arr[j - i]`) and adding the new element (`arr[j]`).
3. **Update of `cur_max`**: If the updated `cur` is greater than `cur_max`, `cur_max` is updated to the new value of `cur`.

### Final Output State:
- **If `k >= n`**: The loop does not execute. Therefore, `cur_max` remains the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`.
- **If `k < n`**: The loop will iterate from `i` to `n-1`, updating `cur` and `cur_max` as described. After all iterations, `cur_max` will hold the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, the final state of the variables will be:
- `n` and `k` remain the same as they were initially.
- `a` remains the same as it was initially.
- `arr` remains the same as it was initially.
- `max_avg` remains 0 (it is not modified in the loop).
- `i` remains `k` (it is not modified in the loop).
- `cur` will be the sum of the last `k` elements in the array.
- `cur_max` will be the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k`, `cur` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `arr`, `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`.**
