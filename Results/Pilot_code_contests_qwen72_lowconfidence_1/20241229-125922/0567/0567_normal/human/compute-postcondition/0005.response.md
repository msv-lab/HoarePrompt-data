The line `cur_max = cur` assigns the current value of `cur` (which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`) to `cur_max`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `arr`, `max_avg`, or `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k`, `cur` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`, `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`.**
