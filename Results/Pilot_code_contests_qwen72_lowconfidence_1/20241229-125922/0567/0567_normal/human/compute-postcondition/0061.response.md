The code snippet assigns the value of `cur_max / float(i)` to the variable `max_avg`. Given that the current value of `cur_max / float(i)` is already greater than the current value of `max_avg`, this assignment updates `max_avg` to the new value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\); `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 2`; `cur` is the sum of the last `k + 2` elements of `arr`; `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k + 2` in `arr`; `max_avg` is `cur_max / float(k + 2)`.**
