The code `cur_max = cur` updates the value of `cur_max` to the current value of `cur`. Since `cur` was previously updated to `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 3]`, `cur_max` now holds this new value. The conditions for updating `cur_max` and `max_avg` mentioned in the initial state are not checked in this code snippet, so `cur_max` and `max_avg` remain unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\); `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 2`; `j` is `k + 3`; `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 3]`; `cur_max` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 3]`; `max_avg` remains unchanged.**
