To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input.
- `i` is `k`.
- `cur` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `arr`.
- `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`.
- `max_avg` is updated to `cur_max / float(k)` if `cur_max / float(k)` is greater than `max_avg`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(k, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from `k` to `n + 1` (exclusive). This means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

### Adjusting the States:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The other states (`n`, `k`, `a`, `arr`, `cur`, `cur_max`, `max_avg`) remain the same unless they are modified within the loop body.

### Updated State:
- `i` is now `k + 1`.
- The loop will continue if `k + 1` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `cur` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `arr`, `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`**.
