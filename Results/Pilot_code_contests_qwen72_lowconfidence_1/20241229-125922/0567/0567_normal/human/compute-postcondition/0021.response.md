The code snippet updates the value of `max_avg` by setting it to the result of dividing `cur_max` by `i`. Given that `i` is `k` and the current value of `cur_max / float(i)` is greater than `max_avg`, this assignment effectively updates `max_avg` to this new, higher value.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is `cur_max / float(k)`, `i` is `k`, `cur` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `arr`, `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`.**
