To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(k, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range of the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(k, n + 1)`.
   - This means `i` starts at `k` and goes up to `n` (inclusive).

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range `range(k, n + 1)` must contain at least one element.
   - This requires that `k` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
   - `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input.
   - `max_avg` is 0.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `k` and `n` are already constrained such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), the loop will always execute at least once as long as these constraints are met.
   - The variable `i` should start at `k` for the loop to begin.

### Final State:

Given the initial state and the loop requirements, the state does not need to be adjusted because the constraints already ensure that the loop will execute. However, for clarity, we can explicitly state the initial values and conditions:

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k`**.
