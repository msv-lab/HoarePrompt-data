### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input
- `max_avg` is 0
- `i` is `k` and `k < n`
- `cur` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`
- `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`

### Code Snippet:
```python
cur = cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Affected Variables**:
   - `cur` is updated in this line of code.

2. **Check Previous Values**:
   - `cur` is initially the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`.
   - `arr` is an iterable of integers.
   - `j` is the current index in the loop, ranging from `i` to `n-1`.
   - `i` is `k`.

3. **Calculate the New Value**:
   - The new value of `cur` is calculated as follows:
     - Subtract the element at position `j - i` from `cur`.
     - Add the element at position `j` to `cur`.

4. **Update the State**:
   - The new value of `cur` is `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`.

### Output State:
**`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k` and `k < n`, `cur` is `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`, `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`.**
