Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `cur` is `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`, `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k + 1` elements of `arr`, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`, `k + 1 < n`, and the current value of `cur` is greater than `cur_max`.**
