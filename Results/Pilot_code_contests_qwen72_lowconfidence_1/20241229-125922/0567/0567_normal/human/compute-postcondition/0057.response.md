The code snippet `cur_max = cur` updates the value of `cur_max` to the current value of `cur`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\); `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 2`; `j` is `k + 4`; `cur` is `cur - arr[2] + arr[k + 4]`; `cur_max` is `cur`; `max_avg` remains unchanged.**
