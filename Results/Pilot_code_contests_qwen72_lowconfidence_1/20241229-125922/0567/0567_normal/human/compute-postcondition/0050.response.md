Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\); `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 2`; `cur` is `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`. If `cur` is greater than `cur_max`, then `cur_max` is updated to `cur`, and `max_avg` is updated if `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`. Otherwise, `cur_max` and `max_avg` remain unchanged.***
