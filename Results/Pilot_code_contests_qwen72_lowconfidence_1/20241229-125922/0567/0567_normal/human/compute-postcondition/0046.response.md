To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for j in range(i, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will iterate over the range starting from `i` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n`.

Let's break down the given state and determine what needs to be adjusted:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\)
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
   - `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input
   - `i` is `k + 2`
   - `cur` is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`
   - `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`
   - `max_avg` is updated if `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `i < n`.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `i` is defined as `k + 2`, we need to ensure that `k + 2 < n` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Given that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), the condition `k + 2 < n` should be satisfied if `k < n - 2`.

4. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\)
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
   - `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input
   - `i` is `k + 2`
   - `cur` is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`
   - `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`
   - `max_avg` is updated if `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `k < n - 2` for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 2`, `cur` is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`, `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`, and `max_avg` is updated if `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`**
