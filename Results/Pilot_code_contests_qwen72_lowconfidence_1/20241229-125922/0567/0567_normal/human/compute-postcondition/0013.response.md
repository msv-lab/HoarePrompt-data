The code snippet assigns the value of `cur` to `cur_max`. Let's break down the changes:

- `cur_max` is now set to the current value of `cur`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `arr`, `max_avg`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k`, `j` is `k + 1`, `k + 1 < n`, `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 1]`, `cur_max` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 1]`**.
