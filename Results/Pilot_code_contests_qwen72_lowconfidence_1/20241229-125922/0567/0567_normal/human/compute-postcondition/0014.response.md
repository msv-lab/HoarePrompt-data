Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k`, `j` is `k + 1`, `k + 1 < n`, `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 1]`. If `cur` is greater than `cur_max`, then `cur_max` is updated to `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 1]`.***
