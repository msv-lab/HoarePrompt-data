To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input.
- `i` is `k + 2`.
- `j` is `k + 3`.
- `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 3]`.
- If `cur > cur_max`, then `cur_max` is updated to `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 3]` and `max_avg` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur_max` and `max_avg` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `k + 2`.
   - `j` is `k + 3`.
   - `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 3]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop increments `j` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 4`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `i` remains `k + 2` because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `cur` and `cur_max` will be updated based on the loop body logic, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to these variables unless explicitly stated.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is `k + 2`.
- `j` is `k + 4`.
- `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 3]` (unchanged unless modified in the loop body).
- `cur_max` and `max_avg` remain unchanged unless modified in the loop body.

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\); `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 2`; `j` is `k + 4`; `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 3]`. If `cur > cur_max`, then `cur_max` is updated to `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 3]` and `max_avg` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur_max` and `max_avg` remain unchanged.**
