Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then calculates the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length between `k` and `n` (inclusive). The function prints this maximum average to the standard output. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original values of `n` and `k`, the list `arr`, and the calculated maximum average. Note that the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include scenarios where `k` equals `n` (the entire array is considered), and when `k` is 1 (every single element is a subarray of length 1). The function handles these cases correctly. However, the function does not validate the input constraints (e.g., ensuring `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000`), which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is invalid. **
