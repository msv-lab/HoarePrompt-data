To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `cur` is the sum of the first `k + 1` elements of `arr`
- `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k + 1` elements of `arr`
- `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop `for j in range(i, n)` will execute if the range `i` to `n` is valid. This means that `i` must be less than `n`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: `i` is set to `k + 1`.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `i` (which is `k + 1`) must be less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `i` (which is `k + 1`) is less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the following condition must be true:
- `k + 1 < n`

Given that `k` is already constrained to be between 1 and `n`, and `n` is at least `k + 1` for the loop to execute, the state can be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `cur` is the sum of the first `k + 1` elements of `arr`, `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k + 1` elements of `arr`, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`, and `k + 1 < n`**
