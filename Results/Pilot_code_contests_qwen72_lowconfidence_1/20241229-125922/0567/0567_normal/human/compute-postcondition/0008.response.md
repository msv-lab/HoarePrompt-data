Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k` and `k < n`, `cur` is the result of `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`, `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`. The current value of `cur` is greater than the current value of `cur_max`.***
