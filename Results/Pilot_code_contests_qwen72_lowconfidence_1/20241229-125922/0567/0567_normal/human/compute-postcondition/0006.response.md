To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input
- `max_avg` is 0
- `i` is `k`
- `cur` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`
- `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over the range `range(i, n)`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(i, n)` is not empty. This means that `i` must be less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Ensure `i < n`**: Since `i` is set to `k` and `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `n`, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `n`.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should ensure that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute. Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k` and `k < n`, `cur` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`, `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`.**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
