The value of `cur_max` is updated to be equal to the current value of `cur`. Since `cur` was already stated to be greater than `cur_max`, this update ensures that `cur_max` now holds the value of `cur`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\); `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 2`; `cur` is `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`; `cur_max` is now equal to `cur`; `max_avg` is updated if `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`.**
