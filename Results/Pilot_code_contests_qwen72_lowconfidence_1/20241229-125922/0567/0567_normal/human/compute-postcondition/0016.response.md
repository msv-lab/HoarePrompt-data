The code snippet updates the value of `cur` by subtracting the element at index `j - i` from `arr` and adding the element at index `j` from `arr`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input
- `max_avg` is 0
- `i` is `k`
- `j` is `k + 2`
- `k + 2 < n`
- `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 1]`

Let's break down the impact of the code on the program:

1. `j - i` evaluates to `(k + 2) - k`, which simplifies to `2`.
2. `cur` is updated to `cur - arr[2] + arr[j]`.
3. Since `j` is `k + 2`, `arr[j]` is `arr[k + 2]`.

Therefore, the new value of `cur` is `cur - arr[2] + arr[k + 2]`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `arr`, `max_avg`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k`, `j` is `k + 2`, `k + 2 < n`, `cur` is `cur - arr[2] + arr[k + 2]`**.
