The code snippet updates the value of `cur` by subtracting the element at index `j - i` in the `arr` list and adding the element at index `j` in the `arr` list. Let's break down the changes:

- `i` is `k + 2`.
- `j` is `k + 4`.
- `j - i` simplifies to `(k + 4) - (k + 2)`, which equals `2`.

Thus, the code snippet:
```python
cur = cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]
```
translates to:
```python
cur = cur - arr[2] + arr[k + 4]
```

This means `cur` is updated by subtracting the element at index `2` and adding the element at index `k + 4` in the `arr` list.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\); `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 2`; `j` is `k + 4`; `cur` is `cur - arr[2] + arr[k + 4]`; if `cur > cur_max`, then `cur_max` is updated to `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 3]` and `max_avg` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur_max` and `max_avg` remain unchanged.**
