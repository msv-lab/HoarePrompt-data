The code snippet assigns the current value of `cur` to the variable `cur_max`. This means that `cur_max` now holds the same value as `cur`, which is calculated as `cur - arr[2] + arr[k + 2]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input
- `max_avg` is 0
- `i` is `k`
- `j` is `k + 2`
- `k + 2 < n`
- `cur` is `cur - arr[2] + arr[k + 2]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `cur_max` is now equal to `cur - arr[2] + arr[k + 2]`

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k`, `j` is `k + 2`, `k + 2 < n`, `cur` is `cur - arr[2] + arr[k + 2]`, `cur_max` is `cur - arr[2] + arr[k + 2]`**
