The provided code snippet updates the value of `cur` by subtracting the element at position `j - i` from `arr` and adding the element at position `j` from `arr`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `cur` is updated to `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `arr`, `i`, `cur_max`, and `max_avg` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\); `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 2`; `cur` is `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`; `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`; `max_avg` is updated if `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`**
