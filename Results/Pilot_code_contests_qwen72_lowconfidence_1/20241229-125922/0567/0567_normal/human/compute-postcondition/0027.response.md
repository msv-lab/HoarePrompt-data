The given code updates the value of `cur` by subtracting the element at index `j - i` from `cur` and adding the element at index `j` from `arr`. Since `i` is `k + 1`, this operation effectively slides a window of size `k + 1` over the array `arr` and updates `cur` to reflect the sum of the current window.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

- `cur` is updated to `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `arr`, `i`, `cur_max`, `max_avg`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `cur` is the sum of the first `k + 1` elements of `arr`
- `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k + 1` elements of `arr`
- `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`
- `k + 1 < n`

After executing the code, the updated state is:
- `cur` is now `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`
- All other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `cur` is `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`, `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k + 1` elements of `arr`, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`, and `k + 1 < n`**
