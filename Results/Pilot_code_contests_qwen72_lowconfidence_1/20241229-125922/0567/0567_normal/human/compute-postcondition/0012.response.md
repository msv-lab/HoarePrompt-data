The code updates the value of `cur` by subtracting `arr[j - i]` and adding `arr[j]` to the current value of `cur`. Given the initial state, `cur` is modified according to this formula, and the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `arr`, `max_avg`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

The new value of `cur` is calculated as follows:
- `cur` becomes `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`.

Since `i` is `k` and `j` is `k + 1`, the expression `j - i` simplifies to `(k + 1) - k`, which equals 1. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:
- `cur` becomes `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 1]`.

The output state reflects the updated value of `cur` while keeping all other variables in their original state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k`, `j` is `k + 1`, `k + 1 < n`, `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 1]`**
