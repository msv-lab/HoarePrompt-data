To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input.
- `max_avg` is 0.
- `i` is `k`.
- `j` is `k + 1`.
- `k + 1 < n`.
- `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 1]`.
- If `cur` is greater than `cur_max`, then `cur_max` is updated to `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 1]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `i` to `n-1` (inclusive).
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `k`.
   - `j` is `k + 1`.
   - `k + 1 < n`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **`j` Increment**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `k + 2`.
- **Loop Condition Check**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than `n`. Since `j` is now `k + 2`, the condition `k + 2 < n` must hold true.

### Updated State:
- `n` and `k` remain the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `arr` remains the same.
- `max_avg` remains the same.
- `i` remains `k`.
- `j` is now `k + 2`.
- `k + 2 < n` must be true for the loop to execute again.
- `cur` and `cur_max` may have been updated during the previous iteration, but their values depend on the specific operations inside the loop body.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k`, `j` is `k + 2`, `k + 2 < n`, `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 1]`, if `cur` is greater than `cur_max`, then `cur_max` is updated to `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 1]`.**
