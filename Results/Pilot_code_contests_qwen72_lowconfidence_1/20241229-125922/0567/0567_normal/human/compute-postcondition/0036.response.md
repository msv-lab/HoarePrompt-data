The given code snippet updates the value of `cur` by subtracting the element `arr[j - i]` and adding the element `arr[j]`. Here, `i` is `k + 1`, and `j` is `j + 1` from the initial state.

Given:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `j` is `j + 1`
- `cur` is `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`
- `cur_max` is the maximum of the previous `cur_max` and the current `cur`
- `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`
- `k + 1 < n`

Step-by-step impact:
1. `cur` is updated to `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`
   - This means `cur` is adjusted by removing the element at position `j - (k + 1)` and adding the element at position `j`.

Output State:
**`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `cur` is `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`, `cur_max` is the maximum of the previous `cur_max` and the current `cur`, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`, `k + 1 < n`**
