The given code updates the value of `cur` by subtracting the element at the index `j - i` from `arr` and adding the element at the index `j` from `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input
- `i` is `k + 2`
- `j` is `k + 3`
- `cur` is updated by the expression `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`
- `cur_max` and `max_avg` are updated if `cur` is greater than `cur_max` and `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`, otherwise they remain unchanged

Step-by-step impact of the code:
1. Calculate `j - i`:
   - Since `j` is `k + 3` and `i` is `k + 2`, `j - i` is `(k + 3) - (k + 2) = 1`.

2. Update `cur`:
   - The new value of `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 3]`.

The output state reflects the updated value of `cur` while keeping all other initial conditions intact.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\); `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 2`; `j` is `k + 3`; `cur` is `cur - arr[1] + arr[k + 3]`; `cur_max` and `max_avg` remain unchanged unless `cur` is greater than `cur_max` and `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`.**
