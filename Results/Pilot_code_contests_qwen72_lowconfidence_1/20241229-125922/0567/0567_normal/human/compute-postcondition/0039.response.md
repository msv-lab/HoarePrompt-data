Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `cur` is the sum of the last `k` elements in the subarray of `arr` starting from index `i - k` to `n - 1`, `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`. If `n == k + 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` remains the sum of the first `k + 1` elements of `arr`, while `cur_max` remains the same as the initial `cur`.**
