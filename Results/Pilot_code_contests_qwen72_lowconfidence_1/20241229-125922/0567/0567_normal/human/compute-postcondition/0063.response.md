Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `arr`, `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `n` in `arr`. `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` to `n` in `arr`.**
