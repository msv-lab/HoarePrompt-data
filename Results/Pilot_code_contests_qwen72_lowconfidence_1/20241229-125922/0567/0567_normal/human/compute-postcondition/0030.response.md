Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `cur` is `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`, `cur_max` is the maximum of the previous `cur_max` and the current `cur`, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`, and `k + 1 < n`. If the current value of `cur` is greater than the previous `cur_max`, then `cur_max` is updated to the current value of `cur`.***
