The code initializes the variable `max_avg` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, or `arr`. The only change is the assignment of `max_avg`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000, `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0**
