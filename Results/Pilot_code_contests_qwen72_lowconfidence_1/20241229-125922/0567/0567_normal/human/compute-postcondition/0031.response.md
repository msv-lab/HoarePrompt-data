To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
   - `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input.
   - `i` is `k + 1`.
   - `cur` is `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`.
   - `cur_max` is the maximum of the previous `cur_max` and the current `cur`.
   - `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`.
   - `k + 1 < n`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i, n):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range `[i, n-1]`.

4. **Adjustments Needed for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `cur` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.
   - The value of `cur_max` will be updated if the new `cur` is greater than the previous `cur_max`.

Given these points, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- `j` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `cur` will be updated to `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`.
- `cur_max` will be updated to the maximum of the previous `cur_max` and the new `cur`.

Since `i` is `k + 1` and `k + 1 < n`, the loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `cur` is `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`, `cur_max` is the maximum of the previous `cur_max` and the current `cur`, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`, and `k + 1 < n`.**
