The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into individual components, which are then converted to integers using the `map` function. This results in an iterable of integers, which is stored in the variable `arr`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers within certain bounds, and `a` is a list of `n` integers also within certain bounds. However, the code does not affect `n` or `k` directly, and `a` is not explicitly mentioned in the code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000, `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input.**
