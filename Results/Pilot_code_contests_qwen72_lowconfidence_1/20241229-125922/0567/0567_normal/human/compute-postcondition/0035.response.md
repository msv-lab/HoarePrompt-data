To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the current state and the conditions required for the loop to continue.

### Current State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `cur` is `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`.
- `cur_max` is the maximum of the previous `cur_max` and the current `cur`.
- `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`.
- If `cur` is greater than `cur_max`, `cur_max` is updated to `cur`. Otherwise, `cur_max` remains unchanged.
- `k + 1 < n`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `for j in range(i, n)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **Increment `j`**: The loop variable `j` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
2. **Update `cur`**: The value of `cur` needs to be updated according to the formula `cur = cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`.
3. **Update `cur_max`**: If the new `cur` is greater than the current `cur_max`, `cur_max` should be updated to the new `cur`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `j + 1`.
- For the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1` again.
- The value of `cur` will be updated to `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`.
- `cur_max` will be updated if the new `cur` is greater than the current `cur_max`.

### Final State:
- `n` and `k` remain the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `arr` remains the same.
- `i` remains `k + 1`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `cur` is updated to `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`.
- `cur_max` is updated if the new `cur` is greater than the current `cur_max`.
- `max_avg` remains the same.

### State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `cur` is `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`, `cur_max` is the maximum of the previous `cur_max` and the current `cur`, and `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`. If `cur` is greater than `cur_max`, `cur_max` is updated to `cur`. Otherwise, `cur_max` remains unchanged. `k + 1 < n`.**
