The code snippet `cur = sum(arr[:i])` recalculates the value of `cur` as the sum of the first `i` elements of the `arr`. Given that `i` is `k + 2`, `cur` now holds the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`.

- `n` and `k` remain integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `arr` remains an iterable of integers read from the input.
- `i` remains `k + 2`.
- `cur` is now the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`.
- `cur_max` remains the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`.
- `max_avg` remains updated if `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 2`, `cur` is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`, `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`, and `max_avg` is updated if `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`.**
