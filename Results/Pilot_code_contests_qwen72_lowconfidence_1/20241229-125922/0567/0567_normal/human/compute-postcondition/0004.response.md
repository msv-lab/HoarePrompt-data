The code snippet initializes the variable `cur` with the sum of the first `i` elements of `arr`. Given that `i` is equal to `k`, `cur` will be the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k`, `cur` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k`, `cur` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`.**
