To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how the variables change over time.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input.
- `i` is `k + 2`.
- `cur` is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`.
- `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`.
- `max_avg` is updated if `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the range from `i` to `n-1` (inclusive). For each iteration:
- `cur` is updated by subtracting the element `arr[j - i]` and adding the element `arr[j]`.
- If `cur` is greater than `cur_max`, `cur_max` is updated to `cur`.

### Final State:
- After the loop finishes, `cur` will be the sum of the last `k + 2` elements of `arr` (from `arr[n - k - 2]` to `arr[n-1]`).
- `cur_max` will be the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k + 2` in `arr`.
- `max_avg` will be the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k + 2` in `arr`.

### Output State:
If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `k + 2 >= n`), then:
- `cur` remains the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`.
- `cur_max` remains the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`.
- `max_avg` remains the same as it was initially.

If the loop executes:
- `cur` is the sum of the last `k + 2` elements of `arr`.
- `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k + 2` in `arr`.
- `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k + 2` in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\); `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 2`; `cur` is the sum of the last `k + 2` elements of `arr`; `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k + 2` in `arr`; `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k + 2` in `arr`.**
