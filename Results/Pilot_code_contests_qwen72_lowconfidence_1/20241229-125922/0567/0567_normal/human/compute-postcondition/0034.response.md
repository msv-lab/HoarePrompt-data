Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `cur` is `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`, `cur_max` is the maximum of the previous `cur_max` and the current `cur`, and `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`. If `cur` is greater than `cur_max`, `cur_max` is updated to `cur`. Otherwise, `cur_max` remains unchanged. `k + 1 < n`.***
