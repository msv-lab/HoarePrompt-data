The code snippet updates the value of `cur` by subtracting the element at the index `j - i` from `cur` and adding the element at the index `j` to `cur`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, this effectively shifts the window of the sum by one position to the right.

Let's break down the changes:

- `cur` is updated to `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`.

Since `i` is `k + 1`, `j - i` simplifies to `j - (k + 1)`. This means the element that was previously at the start of the window (of length `k`) is removed, and the new element at the end of the window is added.

Therefore, the updated value of `cur` is:
- `cur` is now `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `arr`, `i`, `j`, `cur_max`, and `max_avg`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `cur` is `cur - arr[j - (k + 1)] + arr[j]`, `cur_max` is the maximum of the previous `cur_max` and the current `cur`, `max_avg` is the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`, and `k + 1 < n`.**
