To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the current state and the conditions required for the next iteration:

### Current State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `cur` is the sum of the last `k` elements in the subarray of `arr` starting from index `i - k` to `n - 1`.
- `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`.
- If `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`, then `max_avg` is updated to `cur_max / (k + 1.0)`. Otherwise, `max_avg` remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
The loop will execute if `i` is in the range from `k` to `n` inclusive. Specifically, the loop will continue as long as `i <= n`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
1. **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is currently `k + 1`, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `k + 2`.
2. **Update `cur`**: The value of `cur` needs to be updated to reflect the sum of the last `k` elements in the subarray starting from index `i - k` to `i - 1`. This means:
   - Subtract the element at index `i - k - 1` from `cur`.
   - Add the element at index `i - 1` to `cur`.
3. **Update `cur_max`**: If the new `cur` is greater than the current `cur_max`, update `cur_max` to the new `cur`.
4. **Update `max_avg`**: If the new `cur_max / float(i)` is greater than the current `max_avg`, update `max_avg` to `cur_max / float(i)`.

### New State:
- `n` and `k` remain the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `arr` remains the same.
- `i` is now `k + 2`.
- `cur` is updated to the sum of the last `k` elements in the subarray starting from index `i - k` to `i - 1`.
- `cur_max` is updated if the new `cur` is greater than the current `cur_max`.
- `max_avg` is updated if the new `cur_max / float(i)` is greater than the current `max_avg`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 2`, `cur` is the sum of the last `k` elements in the subarray of `arr` starting from index `i - k` to `i - 1`, `cur_max` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k` in `arr`, and `max_avg` is updated if `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`.**
