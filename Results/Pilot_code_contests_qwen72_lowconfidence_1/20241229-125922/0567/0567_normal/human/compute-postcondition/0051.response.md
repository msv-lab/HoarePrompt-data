To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input.
- `i` is `k + 2`.
- `cur` is `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`.
- If `cur` is greater than `cur_max`, then `cur_max` is updated to `cur`, and `max_avg` is updated if `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`. Otherwise, `cur_max` and `max_avg` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is in the range `[i, n)`. This means `j` starts at `i` and goes up to but does not include `n`.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `k + 2`.
   - `j` is `i` (which is `k + 2`).
   - `cur` is `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`.
   - `cur_max` and `max_avg` are updated based on the condition `cur > cur_max` and `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`.

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `j` will increment by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `cur` will be recalculated as `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]` with the new value of `j`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is `i + 1` (which is `k + 3`).
- `cur` is recalculated as `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]` with the new value of `j`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\) and \(k < n - 2\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\); `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 2`; `j` is `k + 3`; `cur` is `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`; `cur_max` and `max_avg` are updated if `cur` is greater than `cur_max` and `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`, otherwise they remain unchanged.**
