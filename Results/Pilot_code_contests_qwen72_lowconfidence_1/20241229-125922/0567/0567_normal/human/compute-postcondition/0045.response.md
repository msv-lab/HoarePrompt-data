The code assigns the value of `cur` to `cur_max`. This means that `cur_max` now holds the same value as `cur`, which is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `i` is `k + 2`, `cur` is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`, `cur_max` is the sum of the first `k + 2` elements of `arr`, and `max_avg` is updated if `cur_max / float(i) > max_avg`.
