The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`. Here, `n` and `k` are integers with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000.

However, the provided code snippet does not include the parameters in the function definition. Assuming the correct function signature should be:

```python
def func(n, k, a):
```

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. For the purpose of this description, let's assume the function returns some result based on the parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`.

Given the lack of specific output details, I'll provide a generic description based on common functionalities that might be expected from such a function:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` and `k` are integers with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000. The function returns a result based on these parameters.** 

If you can provide more specific details about the expected output, I can refine this description accordingly.
