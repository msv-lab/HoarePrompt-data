The code snippet `n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to `n` and `k` after converting them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000.

After executing the code:
- `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, which are integers.
- The constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000 still hold true because the input values must satisfy these conditions.
- The list `a` remains unchanged and still contains `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000. `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input.**
