The value of `cur_max` is updated to the current value of `cur`. Since the current value of `cur` is specified to be greater than the current value of `cur_max`, this update ensures that `cur_max` now holds the value of `cur`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k` and `k < n`, `cur` is the result of `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`, `cur_max` is now equal to `cur`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `arr` is an iterable of integers read from the input, `max_avg` is 0, `i` is `k` and `k < n`, `cur` is the result of `cur - arr[j - i] + arr[j]`, `cur_max` is equal to `cur`.**
