Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000, `zc` is 0, `hasBad` is False, `x` is the first element of the list `a` (non-empty string), `ch` is the second character of `x`. If `ch` is '0', `c` is 1 and `c1` is 0. If `ch` is '1', `c1` is 1 and `c` remains 0. If `ch` is not '1' and not '0', or `c1` is greater than 1, `f` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.***
