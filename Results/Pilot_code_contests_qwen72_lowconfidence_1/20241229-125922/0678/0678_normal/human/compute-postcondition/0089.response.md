Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), `x` is the third element of the list `a` and is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with exactly one '1' character, `c` is 0, `c1` is 0, `f` is True, `zc` is 2 * (the count of '0' characters in the third element of `a`), `hasBad` is False, and the current value of `ch` is '0'.**
