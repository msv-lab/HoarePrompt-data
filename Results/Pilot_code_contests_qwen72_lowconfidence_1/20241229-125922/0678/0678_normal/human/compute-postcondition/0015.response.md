Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000, `zc` is 0, `hasBad` is False, `x` is the first element of the list `a` (non-empty string), `f` is True, `c1` is 0. If the current character `ch` is '0', then `c` is 1. Otherwise, `c` remains 0.***
