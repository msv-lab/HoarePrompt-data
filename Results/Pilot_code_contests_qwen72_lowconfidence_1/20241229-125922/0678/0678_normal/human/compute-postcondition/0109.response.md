Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), `x` is the third element of the list `a` and is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with exactly one '1' character, `ch` is the next character in the string `x`, `c1` retains its value from the previous iteration, `c` is increased by 1 if `ch` is '0', `f` is updated based on the new value of `ch`, `zc` remains the same unless the loop exits due to the conditions, and `hasBad` remains the same unless the loop exits due to the conditions.***
