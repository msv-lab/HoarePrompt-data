Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), `x` is the third element of the list `a` and is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with exactly one '1' character. If `ch` == '1', `c1` is incremented by 1. If `ch` == '0', `c` is incremented by 1, and `f` is True if the next `ch` is '1' or '0' and `c1` is not greater than 1; otherwise, `f` is False. `zc` is 2 * (the count of '0' characters in the third element of `a`), and `hasBad` remains False.***
