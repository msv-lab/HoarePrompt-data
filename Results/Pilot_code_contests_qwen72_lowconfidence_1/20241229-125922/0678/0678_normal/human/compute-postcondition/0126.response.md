The code snippet `sys.stdout.write('0' * zc)` writes a string consisting of `zc` number of '0' characters to the standard output. This operation does not alter the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `zc`, or `hasBad`. However, it impacts the standard output.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000.
- `zc` is the total count of '0' characters in all the strings in `a` that consist only of '0' and '1' characters and contain exactly one '1'.
- If `hasBad` is False, indicating that all strings in `a` meet the criteria of being beautiful numbers, a '1' has been written to the standard output.
- If `hasBad` is True, the first string in `a` that does not meet the criteria has been written to the standard output.

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000.
- `zc` is the total count of '0' characters in all the strings in `a` that consist only of '0' and '1' characters and contain exactly one '1'.
- If `hasBad` is False, a '1' followed by `zc` number of '0' characters has been written to the standard output.
- If `hasBad` is True, the first string in `a` that does not meet the criteria followed by `zc` number of '0' characters has been written to the standard output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000, `zc` is the total count of '0' characters in all the strings in `a` that consist only of '0' and '1' characters and contain exactly one '1', if `hasBad` is False, a '1' followed by `zc` number of '0' characters has been written to the standard output, if `hasBad` is True, the first string in `a` that does not meet the criteria followed by `zc` number of '0' characters has been written to the standard output.**
