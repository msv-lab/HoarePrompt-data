Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000, `zc` is 0, `hasBad` is False, `x` is the first element of the list `a` (non-empty string), `ch` is the third character of `x`, `c1` is 1 if `ch` == '1', otherwise `c1` is 0, `f` remains True unless the conditions in the loop body cause it to become False. If `ch` == '0', then `c` is 1. Otherwise, `c` is 0.***
