The code `sys.stdout.write('1')` writes the character '1' to the standard output. This action does not alter any of the variables in the initial state, but it does change the state of the standard output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000. `zc` is the total count of '0' characters in all the strings in `a` that consist only of '0' and '1' characters and contain exactly one '1'. `hasBad` is False, indicating that all strings in `a` meet the criteria of being beautiful numbers (i.e., they contain only '0' or '1' characters and contain at most one '1'). A '1' has been written to the standard output.**
