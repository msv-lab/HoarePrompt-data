The value of `n` is updated to the integer value input by the user through `raw_input()`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and this condition remains valid after the input. The rest of the initial state conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 (value updated from user input), and a list of n non-negative integers ai is provided, where at least n - 1 of these integers are beautiful numbers (a beautiful number is defined as a number consisting only of the digits '1' and '0', with at most one digit '1'). The total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000.**
