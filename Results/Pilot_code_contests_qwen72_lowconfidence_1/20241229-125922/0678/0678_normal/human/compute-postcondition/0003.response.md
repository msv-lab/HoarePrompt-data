The code snippet `sys.stdout.write('0')` writes the character '0' to the standard output without adding a newline. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `n` or `a`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the character '0' has been written to the standard output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers, where at least n - 1 of these integers are beautiful numbers, and the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000. The list `a` contains at least one '0'. A '0' has been written to the standard output.**
