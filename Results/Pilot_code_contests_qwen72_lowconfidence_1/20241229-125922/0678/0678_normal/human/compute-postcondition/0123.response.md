Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000. `zc` is the total count of '0' characters in all the strings in `a` that consist only of '0' and '1' characters and contain exactly one '1'. `hasBad` is False, indicating that all strings in `a` meet the criteria of being beautiful numbers (i.e., they contain only '0' or '1' characters and contain at most one '1'). No string in `a` has been written to the standard output.***
