Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000. `zc` is the total count of '0' characters in all the strings in `a` that consist only of '0' and '1' characters and contain exactly one '1'. If `hasBad` is False, indicating that all strings in `a` meet the criteria of being beautiful numbers, a '1' has been written to the standard output. If `hasBad` is True, the first string in `a` that does not meet the criteria has been written to the standard output.***
