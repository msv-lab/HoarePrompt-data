Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000, `x` is the first element of the list `a` (non-empty string), `c` is the count of '0' characters in `x`, `c1` is the count of '1' characters in `x`. If `f` is True, then `zc` is `c`, `hasBad` is False, and `x` consists only of '0' and '1' characters with exactly one '1' character. If `f` is False, then `zc` is 0, `hasBad` is True, and either there is at least one character in `x` that is not '1' or '0', or there is more than one '1' character in `x`. The string `x` has been printed to the standard output.***
