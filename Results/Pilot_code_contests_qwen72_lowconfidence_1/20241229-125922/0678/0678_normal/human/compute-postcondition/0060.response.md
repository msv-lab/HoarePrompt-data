Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `c` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the current character `ch` is '0' or '1', `c1` is 1 if `ch` is '1', otherwise `c1` remains 0, `f` is True, `zc` is the count of '0' characters in `x`, `hasBad` is False, and `x` consists only of '0' and '1' characters with exactly one '1' character. If `ch` is neither '0' nor '1' or `c1` is greater than 1, then `f` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
