The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. This means no further lines of code will be executed after this point. The state of the program, including the values of variables, is not altered by `exit()`. However, since the program exits, the context in which these variables exist is terminated.

Given the initial state and the execution of `exit()`, the output state includes the fact that the program has exited, and the variables retain their initial values but are no longer accessible in the context of a running program.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers, where at least n - 1 of these integers are beautiful numbers, and the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000. The list `a` contains at least one '0'. A '0' has been written to the standard output. The program has exited.**
