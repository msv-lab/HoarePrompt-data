The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the given code snippet. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function implicitly accepts two parameters:

1. An integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, representing the number of elements in the list.
2. A list of `n` non-negative integers `ai`, where each integer in the list is a beautiful number (consisting only of the digits '1' and '0', with at most one digit '1'), and the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information. To complete the description, we need to infer a plausible output based on common programming tasks related to such parameters. Given the constraints, a plausible functionality could be to count the number of beautiful numbers in the list or to determine some property of these numbers.

However, without explicit output details, we can only describe the parameters the function accepts.

Functionality: **The function implicitly accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and a list of `n` non-negative integers `ai`, where each integer is a beautiful number (consisting only of the digits '1' and '0', with at most one digit '1'), and the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000.**
