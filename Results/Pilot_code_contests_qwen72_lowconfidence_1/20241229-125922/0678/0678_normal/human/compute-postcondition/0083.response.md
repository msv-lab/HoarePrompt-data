Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `c` is the count of '0' characters in `x`, `c1` is the count of '1' characters in `x` (which is 1). If `f` is True, `zc` is 2 * (the count of '0' characters in `x`), `hasBad` is False, and `x` consists only of '0' and '1' characters with exactly one '1' character. If `f` is False, `zc` is the count of '0' characters in `x`, `hasBad` is True, `x` consists only of '0' and '1' characters but does not contain exactly one '1' character, and `x` has been printed to the standard output.***
