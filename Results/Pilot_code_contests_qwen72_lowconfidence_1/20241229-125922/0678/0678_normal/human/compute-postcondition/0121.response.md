Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), `x` is the third element of the list `a` and is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with exactly one '1' character, `c` is the count of '0' characters in `x`, `c1` is the count of '1' characters in `x` (which is 1). If `x` consists only of '0' and '1' characters and contains exactly one '1', then `f` is True, `zc` is 3 * (the count of '0' characters in the third element of `a`), and `hasBad` is False. Otherwise, `f` is False, `zc` is 2 * (the count of '0' characters in the third element of `a`), `hasBad` is True, and the value of `x` has been written to the standard output.***
