Functionality: ** The function processes a list of strings representing non-negative integers, where each integer is expected to be a beautiful number (consisting only of the digits '1' and '0', with at most one digit '1'). The function performs the following actions:

1. Reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings from the standard input.
2. If the list contains the string '0', the function writes '0' to the standard output and exits immediately.
3. If the list does not contain '0', the function iterates through the list to check if each string is a beautiful number. If any string is not a beautiful number, the function writes that string to the standard output and exits.
4. If all strings in the list are beautiful numbers, the function counts the total number of '0' characters in all the strings that consist only of '0' and '1' and contain exactly one '1'.
5. The function then writes '1' followed by the counted number of '0' characters to the standard output.

Final State:
- The function either writes '0' and exits if '0' is found in the list.
- Or, if a non-beautiful number is found, it writes that number and exits.
- Otherwise, it writes '1' followed by the total count of '0' characters in all beautiful numbers and exits.

Edge Cases:
- If the list contains '0', the function writes '0' and exits without further processing.
- If the list contains a non-beautiful number, the function writes that number and exits.
- If all numbers are beautiful, the function writes '1' followed by the count of '0' characters in those numbers. **
