Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers, where at least n - 1 of these integers are beautiful numbers, and the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000. If the list `a` contains at least one '0', a '0' has been written to the standard output and the program has exited.***
