Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), `x` is the third element of the list `a` and is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with exactly one '1' character, `ch` is the next character in the string `x`. If `ch` is neither '0' nor '1' or if `c1` is greater than 1, `c1` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `zc` remains unchanged, `hasBad` remains unchanged, `f` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c1` may be increased by 1 if `ch` is '1', and `c` may be increased by 1 if `ch` is '0', while `zc` and `hasBad` remain unchanged.***
