Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `ch` is the next character in `x`, `c` is 1 or 2 depending on whether the new `ch` was '0' or '1', `c1` is set to 2 if `ch` is '1', `zc` is incremented by 1 if `ch` is '0', `hasBad` remains False, `x` consists only of '0' and '1' characters with exactly one '1' character, and `f` is False if `ch` is neither '0' nor '1' or if `c1` is greater than 1, causing the program to break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `f` remains True.***
