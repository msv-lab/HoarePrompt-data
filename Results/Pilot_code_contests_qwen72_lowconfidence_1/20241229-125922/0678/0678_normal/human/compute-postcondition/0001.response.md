The code `a = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which are stored in the variable `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by this code. The list `a` now contains the non-negative integers provided as input, each as a string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers, where at least n - 1 of these integers are beautiful numbers, and the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000.**
