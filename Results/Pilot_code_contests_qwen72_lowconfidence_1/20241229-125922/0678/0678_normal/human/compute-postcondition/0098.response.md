Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), `x` is the third element of the list `a` and is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with exactly one '1' character, `c` is 0, `c1` is 1 if `ch` is '1', otherwise `c1` is 0, `f` is True if `ch` is '1' or '0' and `c1` is not greater than 1; otherwise, `f` is False, `zc` is 2 * (the count of '0' characters in the third element of `a`), and `hasBad` is False.***
