Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `ch` is the next character in `x`, `c` is 1 or 2 depending on whether the new `ch` was '0' or '1'. If `ch` is '1', `c1` is set to 2, and `f` remains True unless `c1` is greater than 1, in which case `f` is set to False and the loop breaks. If `ch` is '0', `c` is set to 1, `zc` is incremented by 1, and `f` remains True unless the new `ch` is neither '0' nor '1' or `c1` is greater than 1, in which case `f` is set to False and the loop breaks. `hasBad` remains False, and `x` consists only of '0' and '1' characters with exactly one '1' character.***
