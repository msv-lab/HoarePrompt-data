Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n strings representing non-negative integers (with no '0' and at least n - 1 beautiful numbers), the total length of all these numbers' representations does not exceed 100,000. `zc` is the total count of '0' characters in all the strings in `a` that consist only of '0' and '1' characters and contain exactly one '1'. `hasBad` is True if any string in `a` does not meet the criteria of being a beautiful number (i.e., contains characters other than '0' or '1', or contains more than one '1'), otherwise `hasBad` is False. If `hasBad` is True, the first string in `a` that does not meet the criteria has been written to the standard output.**
