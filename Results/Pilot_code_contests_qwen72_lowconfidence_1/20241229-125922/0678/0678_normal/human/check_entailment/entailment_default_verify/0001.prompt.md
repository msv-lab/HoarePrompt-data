You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's the year 4527 and the tanks game that we all know and love still exists. There also exists Great Gena's code, written in 2016. The problem this code solves is: given the number of tanks that go into the battle from each country, find their product. If it is turns to be too large, then the servers might have not enough time to assign tanks into teams and the whole game will collapse!

There are exactly n distinct countries in the world and the i-th country added ai tanks to the game. As the developers of the game are perfectionists, the number of tanks from each country is beautiful. A beautiful number, according to the developers, is such number that its decimal representation consists only of digits '1' and '0', moreover it contains at most one digit '1'. However, due to complaints from players, some number of tanks of one country was removed from the game, hence the number of tanks of this country may not remain beautiful.

Your task is to write the program that solves exactly the same problem in order to verify Gena's code correctness. Just in case.

Input

The first line of the input contains the number of countries n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000). The second line contains n non-negative integers ai without leading zeroes — the number of tanks of the i-th country.

It is guaranteed that the second line contains at least n - 1 beautiful numbers and the total length of all these number's representations doesn't exceed 100 000.

Output

Print a single number without leading zeroes — the product of the number of tanks presented by each country.

Examples

Input

3
5 10 1


Output

50

Input

4
1 1 10 11


Output

110

Input

5
0 3 1 100 1


Output

0

Note

In sample 1 numbers 10 and 1 are beautiful, number 5 is not not.

In sample 2 number 11 is not beautiful (contains two '1's), all others are beautiful.

In sample 3 number 3 is not beautiful, all others are beautiful.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = raw_input().split()
    if '0' in a:
        sys.stdout.write('0')
        exit()
    zc = 0
    hasBad = False
    for x in a:
        f = True
        c = 0
        c1 = 0
        for ch in x:
            if ch == '0':
                c += 1
            if ch == '1':
                c1 += 1
            if ch != '1' and ch != '0' or c1 > 1:
                f = False
                break
        if f:
            zc += c
        else:
            hasBad = True
            sys.stdout.write(x)
    if not hasBad:
        sys.stdout.write('1')
    sys.stdout.write('0' * zc)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case when there are multiple non-beautiful numbers in the input. According to the problem statement, there can be at most one non-beautiful number among the inputs. If there are multiple non-beautiful numbers, the program will concatenate them incorrectly, leading to an incorrect result.

Example of failure:
- Input: `4\n11 11 1 10`
- Expected Output: `110`
- Actual Output: `11110`

In this case, the program writes both non-beautiful numbers (`11` and `11`) to the output, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be to output the product of all numbers, which would be `110` in this case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a list of strings representing non-negative integers, where each integer is expected to be a beautiful number (consisting only of the digits '1' and '0', with at most one digit '1'). The function performs the following actions:

1. Reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings from the standard input.
2. If the list contains the string '0', the function writes '0' to the standard output and exits immediately.
3. If the list does not contain '0', the function iterates through the list to check if each string is a beautiful number. If any string is not a beautiful number, the function writes that string to the standard output and exits.
4. If all strings in the list are beautiful numbers, the function counts the total number of '0' characters in all the strings that consist only of '0' and '1' and contain exactly one '1'.
5. The function then writes '1' followed by the counted number of '0' characters to the standard output.

Final State:
- The function either writes '0' and exits if '0' is found in the list.
- Or, if a non-beautiful number is found, it writes that number and exits.
- Otherwise, it writes '1' followed by the total count of '0' characters in all beautiful numbers and exits.

Edge Cases:
- If the list contains '0', the function writes '0' and exits without further processing.
- If the list contains a non-beautiful number, the function writes that number and exits.
- If all numbers are beautiful, the function writes '1' followed by the count of '0' characters in those numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
