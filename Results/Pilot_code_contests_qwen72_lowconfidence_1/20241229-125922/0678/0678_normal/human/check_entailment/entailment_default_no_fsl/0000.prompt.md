You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's the year 4527 and the tanks game that we all know and love still exists. There also exists Great Gena's code, written in 2016. The problem this code solves is: given the number of tanks that go into the battle from each country, find their product. If it is turns to be too large, then the servers might have not enough time to assign tanks into teams and the whole game will collapse!

There are exactly n distinct countries in the world and the i-th country added ai tanks to the game. As the developers of the game are perfectionists, the number of tanks from each country is beautiful. A beautiful number, according to the developers, is such number that its decimal representation consists only of digits '1' and '0', moreover it contains at most one digit '1'. However, due to complaints from players, some number of tanks of one country was removed from the game, hence the number of tanks of this country may not remain beautiful.

Your task is to write the program that solves exactly the same problem in order to verify Gena's code correctness. Just in case.

Input

The first line of the input contains the number of countries n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000). The second line contains n non-negative integers ai without leading zeroes — the number of tanks of the i-th country.

It is guaranteed that the second line contains at least n - 1 beautiful numbers and the total length of all these number's representations doesn't exceed 100 000.

Output

Print a single number without leading zeroes — the product of the number of tanks presented by each country.

Examples

Input

5 10 1


Output

50

Input

4
1 1 10 11


Output

110

Input

5
0 3 1 100 1


Output

0

Note

In sample 1 numbers 10 and 1 are beautiful, number 5 is not not.

In sample 2 number 11 is not beautiful (contains two '1's), all others are beautiful.

In sample 3 number 3 is not beautiful, all others are beautiful.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = raw_input().split()
    if '0' in a:
        sys.stdout.write('0')
        exit()
    zc = 0
    hasBad = False
    for x in a:
        f = True
        c = 0
        c1 = 0
        for ch in x:
            if ch == '0':
                c += 1
            if ch == '1':
                c1 += 1
            if ch != '1' and ch != '0' or c1 > 1:
                f = False
                break
        if f:
            zc += c
        else:
            hasBad = True
            sys.stdout.write(x)
    if not hasBad:
        sys.stdout.write('1')
    sys.stdout.write('0' * zc)


```
Output hints: The function processes a list of strings representing non-negative integers, where each integer is expected to be a beautiful number (consisting only of the digits '1' and '0', with at most one digit '1'). The function performs the following actions:

1. Reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings from the standard input.
2. If the list contains the string '0', the function writes '0' to the standard output and exits immediately.
3. If the list does not contain '0', the function iterates through the list to check if each string is a beautiful number. If any string is not a beautiful number, the function writes that string to the standard output and exits.
4. If all strings in the list are beautiful numbers, the function counts the total number of '0' characters in all the strings that consist only of '0' and '1' and contain exactly one '1'.
5. The function then writes '1' followed by the counted number of '0' characters to the standard output.

Final State:
- The function either writes '0' and exits if '0' is found in the list.
- Or, if a non-beautiful number is found, it writes that number and exits.
- Otherwise, it writes '1' followed by the total count of '0' characters in all beautiful numbers and exits.

Edge Cases:
- If the list contains '0', the function writes '0' and exits without further processing.
- If the list contains a non-beautiful number, the function writes that number and exits.
- If all numbers are beautiful, the function writes '1' followed by the count of '0' characters in those numbers.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
