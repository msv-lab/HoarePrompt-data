n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. ai is a list of n non-negative integers, where at least n - 1 of these integers are beautiful numbers (a beautiful number is defined as a number whose decimal representation consists only of digits '1' and '0', and contains at most one digit '1'). The total length of the decimal representations of all numbers in ai does not exceed 100,000.
