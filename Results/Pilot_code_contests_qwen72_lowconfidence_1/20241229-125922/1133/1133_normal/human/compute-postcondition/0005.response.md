Output State: **The program returns an integer `tmp` which is formed by concatenating the character at index `code_len - 1` of `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. If `tmp` is less than `cut_off[code_len - 1]`, `tmp` is updated to `tmp + power_of_10[code_len - 1]` and remains less than or equal to the value of `cut_off[code_len - 1]`.**
