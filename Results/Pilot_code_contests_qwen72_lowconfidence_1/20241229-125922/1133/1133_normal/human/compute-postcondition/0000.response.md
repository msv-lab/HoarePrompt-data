The length of `code_str` is calculated and assigned to `code_len`. Since `code_str` is a string of the form "IAO'y" where 'y' is a non-empty string of digits and its length is at most nine, the length of `code_str` will be 4 plus the length of 'y'. Therefore, the value of `code_len` will be between 5 and 13 (inclusive).

Output State: **`code_str` is a string representing an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y is a non-empty string of digits and the length of y is at most nine, `code_len` is between 5 and 13 inclusive.**
