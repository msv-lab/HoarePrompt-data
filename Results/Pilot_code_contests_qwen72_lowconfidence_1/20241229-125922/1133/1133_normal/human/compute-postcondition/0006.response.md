The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `code_str`. `code_str` is a string representing an abbreviation of the form IAO'y, where y is a non-empty string of digits and the length of y is at most nine. After executing the function body, the function returns an integer `tmp` which is formed by concatenating the character at index `code_len - 1` of `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. If `tmp` is less than `cut_off[code_len - 1]`, `tmp` is updated to `tmp + power_of_10[code_len - 1]` and remains less than or equal to the value of `cut_off[code_len - 1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `code_str` and returns an integer `tmp` formed by concatenating the last character of `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. If `tmp` is less than `cut_off[code_len - 1]`, `tmp` is updated to `tmp + power_of_10[code_len - 1]` ensuring it remains less than or equal to `cut_off[code_len - 1]`.**
