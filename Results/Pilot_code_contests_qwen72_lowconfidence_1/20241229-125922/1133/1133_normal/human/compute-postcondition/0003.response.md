The value of `tmp` is updated by adding `power_of_10[code_len - 1]` to its current value. The initial value of `tmp` is less than the value of `cut_off[code_len - 1]`. After this operation, `tmp` will be increased by `power_of_10[code_len - 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `code_str` is a string representing an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y is a non-empty string of digits and the length of y is at most nine. `code_len` is between 5 and 13 inclusive. `tmp` is an integer formed by concatenating the character at index `code_len - 1` of `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer, plus `power_of_10[code_len - 1]`. The new value of `tmp` is now `tmp + power_of_10[code_len - 1]`, which is still less than or equal to the value of `cut_off[code_len - 1]` since `tmp` was initially less than `cut_off[code_len - 1]` and `power_of_10[code_len - 1]` is a power of 10.

Output State: **`code_str` is a string representing an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y is a non-empty string of digits and the length of y is at most nine. `code_len` is between 5 and 13 inclusive. `tmp` is now `tmp + power_of_10[code_len - 1]` and is less than or equal to the value of `cut_off[code_len - 1]`.**
