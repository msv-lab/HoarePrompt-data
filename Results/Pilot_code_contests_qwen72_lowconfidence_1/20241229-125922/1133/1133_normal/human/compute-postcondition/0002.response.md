Postcondition: **`code_str` is a string representing an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y is a non-empty string of digits and the length of y is at most nine. `code_len` is between 5 and 13 inclusive. `tmp` is an integer formed by concatenating the character at index `code_len - 1` of `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. The current value of `tmp` is less than the value of `cut_off[code_len - 1]`.**
