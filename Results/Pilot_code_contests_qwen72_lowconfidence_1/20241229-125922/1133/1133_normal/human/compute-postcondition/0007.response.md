Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `code_str` which is expected to be in the form "IAO'y" where 'y' is a non-empty string of digits with a maximum length of nine. It returns an integer `tmp` which is formed by concatenating the last character of a global variable `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. If `tmp` is less than the corresponding value in a global list `cut_off` at index `code_len - 1` (where `code_len` is the length of `code_str`), `tmp` is incremented by the value in another global list `power_of_10` at the same index. This ensures that the returned `tmp` is adjusted to meet the condition of being greater than or equal to `cut_off[code_len - 1]`. However, the code assumes the existence of `cut_off_str`, `cut_off`, and `power_of_10` without defining them, which could lead to runtime errors if these variables are not properly initialized. Additionally, the function does not validate the format of `code_str` beyond its length, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not conform to the expected pattern. **
