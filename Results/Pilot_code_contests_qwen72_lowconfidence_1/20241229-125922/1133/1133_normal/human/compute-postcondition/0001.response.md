The code snippet `tmp = int(cut_off_str[code_len - 1] + code_str)` concatenates the last character of `cut_off_str` (which is indexed by `code_len - 1`) with the string `code_str`, and then converts the resulting string into an integer, assigning this integer to the variable `tmp`.

Given the initial state:
- `code_str` is a string representing an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y is a non-empty string of digits and the length of y is at most nine.
- `code_len` is between 5 and 13 inclusive.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. **`cut_off_str[code_len - 1]`**: This accesses the character in `cut_off_str` at the index `code_len - 1`. Since `code_len` is between 5 and 13, `code_len - 1` will be between 4 and 12, which are valid indices for `cut_off_str` assuming `cut_off_str` is at least 13 characters long.

2. **Concatenation**: The character from `cut_off_str` at index `code_len - 1` is concatenated with `code_str`.

3. **Conversion to Integer**: The concatenated string is converted to an integer and stored in `tmp`.

Since the exact content of `cut_off_str` and `code_str` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `tmp`. However, we can describe the process and the updated state:

Output State: **`code_str` is a string representing an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y is a non-empty string of digits and the length of y is at most nine, `code_len` is between 5 and 13 inclusive, `tmp` is an integer formed by concatenating the character at index `code_len - 1` of `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer.**
