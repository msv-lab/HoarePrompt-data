Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the input abbreviation could correspond to multiple valid years, and it picks the wrong year. Specifically, the issue lies in the logic of how the year is determined based on the abbreviation.

Consider the following input:
```
1
IAO'15
```

According to the problem description, the abbreviation "IAO'15" should correspond to the year 2015 because the abbreviation "IAO'5" was used in 1995. However, the program will incorrectly output 1915 because it does not correctly account for the fact that "IAO'5" has already been used in 1995.

The program's logic for determining the year is flawed, and it does not correctly handle the requirement that the abbreviation must be unique and the shortest possible. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
