You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: International Abbreviation Olympiad takes place annually starting from 1989. Each year the competition receives an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y stands for some number of consequent last digits of the current year. Organizers always pick an abbreviation with non-empty string y that has never been used before. Among all such valid abbreviations they choose the shortest one and announce it to be the abbreviation of this year's competition.

For example, the first three Olympiads (years 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively) received the abbreviations IAO'9, IAO'0 and IAO'1, while the competition in 2015 received an abbreviation IAO'15, as IAO'5 has been already used in 1995.

You are given a list of abbreviations. For each of them determine the year it stands for.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of abbreviations to process. 

Then n lines follow, each containing a single abbreviation. It's guaranteed that each abbreviation contains at most nine digits.

Output

For each abbreviation given in the input, find the year of the corresponding Olympiad.

Examples

Input

5
IAO'15
IAO'2015
IAO'1
IAO'9
IAO'0


Output

2015
12015
1991
1989
1990


Input

4
IAO'9
IAO'99
IAO'999
IAO'9999


Output

1989
1999
2999
9999
Program:
```
n = input()
base = 1989
m = 9
power_of_10 = [10 ** i for i in range(1, 1 + m)]
cut_off = [0] + power_of_10
for i in range(1, m):
    cut_off[i] += cut_off[i - 1]
cut_off = [base + cut for cut in cut_off]
cut_off_str = [str(cut_off[i])[:-(i + 1)] for i in range(1 + m)]
for _ in range(n):
    print(func_1(raw_input().split("'")[1]))

def func_1(code_str):
    code_len = len(code_str)
    tmp = int(cut_off_str[code_len - 1] + code_str)
    if tmp < cut_off[code_len - 1]:
        tmp += power_of_10[code_len - 1]
    return tmp


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
