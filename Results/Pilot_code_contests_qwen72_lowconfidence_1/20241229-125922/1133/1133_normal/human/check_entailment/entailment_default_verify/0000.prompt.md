You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: International Abbreviation Olympiad takes place annually starting from 1989. Each year the competition receives an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y stands for some number of consequent last digits of the current year. Organizers always pick an abbreviation with non-empty string y that has never been used before. Among all such valid abbreviations they choose the shortest one and announce it to be the abbreviation of this year's competition.

For example, the first three Olympiads (years 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively) received the abbreviations IAO'9, IAO'0 and IAO'1, while the competition in 2015 received an abbreviation IAO'15, as IAO'5 has been already used in 1995.

You are given a list of abbreviations. For each of them determine the year it stands for.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of abbreviations to process. 

Then n lines follow, each containing a single abbreviation. It's guaranteed that each abbreviation contains at most nine digits.

Output

For each abbreviation given in the input, find the year of the corresponding Olympiad.

Program:
```
n = input()
base = 1989
m = 9
power_of_10 = [10 ** i for i in range(1, 1 + m)]
cut_off = [0] + power_of_10
for i in range(1, m):
    cut_off[i] += cut_off[i - 1]
cut_off = [base + cut for cut in cut_off]
cut_off_str = [str(cut_off[i])[:-(i + 1)] for i in range(1 + m)]
for _ in range(n):
    print(func_1(raw_input().split("'")[1]))

def func_1(code_str):
    code_len = len(code_str)
    tmp = int(cut_off_str[code_len - 1] + code_str)
    if tmp < cut_off[code_len - 1]:
        tmp += power_of_10[code_len - 1]
    return tmp


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program seems to correctly handle the problem as described. It processes the input to determine the correct year for each given abbreviation according to the rules specified. The logic for determining the year from the abbreviation involves constructing the full year by combining the base year (1989) with the given suffix and adjusting if necessary to ensure the year has not been used before. The program uses a precomputed list of cutoff values to handle different lengths of the suffix efficiently.

Here’s a breakdown of why the program appears to be correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `base` to 1989, which is the starting year of the Olympiads. It also computes `power_of_10` and `cut_off` arrays to handle the conversion of suffixes to years.

2. **Processing Input**: The program reads the number of abbreviations and then processes each abbreviation individually.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Extract Suffix**: The function extracts the suffix from the abbreviation.
   - **Determine Year**: It constructs the year by combining the appropriate prefix from `cut_off_str` and the suffix. If the constructed year is less than the corresponding cutoff value, it adds the appropriate power of 10 to ensure the year is unique and valid.

4. **Output**: The program prints the year for each abbreviation.

Given the constraints and the examples provided, the program appears to handle all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `code_str` which is expected to be in the form "IAO'y" where 'y' is a non-empty string of digits with a maximum length of nine. It returns an integer `tmp` which is formed by concatenating the last character of a global variable `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. If `tmp` is less than the corresponding value in a global list `cut_off` at index `code_len - 1` (where `code_len` is the length of `code_str`), `tmp` is incremented by the value in another global list `power_of_10` at the same index. This ensures that the returned `tmp` is adjusted to meet the condition of being greater than or equal to `cut_off[code_len - 1]`. However, the code assumes the existence of `cut_off_str`, `cut_off`, and `power_of_10` without defining them, which could lead to runtime errors if these variables are not properly initialized. Additionally, the function does not validate the format of `code_str` beyond its length, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not conform to the expected pattern.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
