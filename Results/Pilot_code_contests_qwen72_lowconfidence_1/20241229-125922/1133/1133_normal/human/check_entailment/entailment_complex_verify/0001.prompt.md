You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: International Abbreviation Olympiad takes place annually starting from 1989. Each year the competition receives an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y stands for some number of consequent last digits of the current year. Organizers always pick an abbreviation with non-empty string y that has never been used before. Among all such valid abbreviations they choose the shortest one and announce it to be the abbreviation of this year's competition.

For example, the first three Olympiads (years 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively) received the abbreviations IAO'9, IAO'0 and IAO'1, while the competition in 2015 received an abbreviation IAO'15, as IAO'5 has been already used in 1995.

You are given a list of abbreviations. For each of them determine the year it stands for.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of abbreviations to process. 

Then n lines follow, each containing a single abbreviation. It's guaranteed that each abbreviation contains at most nine digits.

Output

For each abbreviation given in the input, find the year of the corresponding Olympiad.

Program:
```
n = input()
base = 1989
m = 9
power_of_10 = [10 ** i for i in range(1, 1 + m)]
cut_off = [0] + power_of_10
for i in range(1, m):
    cut_off[i] += cut_off[i - 1]
cut_off = [base + cut for cut in cut_off]
cut_off_str = [str(cut_off[i])[:-(i + 1)] for i in range(1 + m)]
for _ in range(n):
    print(func_1(raw_input().split("'")[1]))

def func_1(code_str):
    code_len = len(code_str)
    tmp = int(cut_off_str[code_len - 1] + code_str)
    if tmp < cut_off[code_len - 1]:
        tmp += power_of_10[code_len - 1]
    return tmp


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the input abbreviation could correspond to multiple valid years, and it picks the wrong year. Specifically, the issue lies in the logic of how the year is determined based on the abbreviation.

Consider the following input:
```
1
IAO'15
```

According to the problem description, the abbreviation "IAO'15" should correspond to the year 2015 because the abbreviation "IAO'5" was used in 1995. However, the program will incorrectly output 1915 because it does not correctly account for the fact that "IAO'5" has already been used in 1995.

The program's logic for determining the year is flawed, and it does not correctly handle the requirement that the abbreviation must be unique and the shortest possible. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = input()
base = 1989
m = 9
power_of_10 = [10 ** i for i in range(1, 1 + m)]
cut_off = [0] + power_of_10
for i in range(1, m):
    cut_off[i] += cut_off[i - 1]
cut_off = [base + cut for cut in cut_off]
cut_off_str = [str(cut_off[i])[:-(i + 1)] for i in range(1 + m)]
for _ in range(n):
    print(func_1(raw_input().split("'")[1]))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: code_str is a string representing an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y is a non-empty string of digits and the length of y is at most nine.
def func_1(code_str):
    code_len = len(code_str)
    tmp = int(cut_off_str[code_len - 1] + code_str)
    if (tmp < cut_off[code_len - 1]) :
        tmp += power_of_10[code_len - 1]
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`code_str` is a string representing an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y is a non-empty string of digits and the length of y is at most nine, `code_len` is between 5 and 13 inclusive, `tmp` is an integer formed by concatenating the character at index `code_len - 1` of `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. If `tmp` is less than `cut_off[code_len - 1]`, `tmp` is updated to `tmp + power_of_10[code_len - 1]` and remains less than or equal to the value of `cut_off[code_len - 1]`.
    return tmp
    #The program returns an integer `tmp` which is formed by concatenating the character at index `code_len - 1` of `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. If `tmp` is less than `cut_off[code_len - 1]`, `tmp` is updated to `tmp + power_of_10[code_len - 1]` and remains less than or equal to the value of `cut_off[code_len - 1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `code_str` which is expected to be in the form "IAO'y" where 'y' is a non-empty string of digits with a maximum length of nine. It returns an integer `tmp` which is formed by concatenating the last character of a global variable `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. If `tmp` is less than the corresponding value in a global list `cut_off` at index `code_len - 1` (where `code_len` is the length of `code_str`), `tmp` is incremented by the value in another global list `power_of_10` at the same index. This ensures that the returned `tmp` is adjusted to meet the condition of being greater than or equal to `cut_off[code_len - 1]`. However, the code assumes the existence of `cut_off_str`, `cut_off`, and `power_of_10` without defining them, which could lead to runtime errors if these variables are not properly initialized. Additionally, the function does not validate the format of `code_str` beyond its length, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not conform to the expected pattern.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
