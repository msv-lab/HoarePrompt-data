You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: International Abbreviation Olympiad takes place annually starting from 1989. Each year the competition receives an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y stands for some number of consequent last digits of the current year. Organizers always pick an abbreviation with non-empty string y that has never been used before. Among all such valid abbreviations they choose the shortest one and announce it to be the abbreviation of this year's competition.

For example, the first three Olympiads (years 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively) received the abbreviations IAO'9, IAO'0 and IAO'1, while the competition in 2015 received an abbreviation IAO'15, as IAO'5 has been already used in 1995.

You are given a list of abbreviations. For each of them determine the year it stands for.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of abbreviations to process. 

Then n lines follow, each containing a single abbreviation. It's guaranteed that each abbreviation contains at most nine digits.

Output

For each abbreviation given in the input, find the year of the corresponding Olympiad.

Program:
```
n = input()
base = 1989
m = 9
power_of_10 = [10 ** i for i in range(1, 1 + m)]
cut_off = [0] + power_of_10
for i in range(1, m):
    cut_off[i] += cut_off[i - 1]
cut_off = [base + cut for cut in cut_off]
cut_off_str = [str(cut_off[i])[:-(i + 1)] for i in range(1 + m)]
for _ in range(n):
    print(func_1(raw_input().split("'")[1]))

def func_1(code_str):
    code_len = len(code_str)
    tmp = int(cut_off_str[code_len - 1] + code_str)
    if tmp < cut_off[code_len - 1]:
        tmp += power_of_10[code_len - 1]
    return tmp


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `code_str` which is expected to be in the form "IAO'y" where 'y' is a non-empty string of digits with a maximum length of nine. It returns an integer `tmp` which is formed by concatenating the last character of a global variable `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. If `tmp` is less than the corresponding value in a global list `cut_off` at index `code_len - 1` (where `code_len` is the length of `code_str`), `tmp` is incremented by the value in another global list `power_of_10` at the same index. This ensures that the returned `tmp` is adjusted to meet the condition of being greater than or equal to `cut_off[code_len - 1]`. However, the code assumes the existence of `cut_off_str`, `cut_off`, and `power_of_10` without defining them, which could lead to runtime errors if these variables are not properly initialized. Additionally, the function does not validate the format of `code_str` beyond its length, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not conform to the expected pattern.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
