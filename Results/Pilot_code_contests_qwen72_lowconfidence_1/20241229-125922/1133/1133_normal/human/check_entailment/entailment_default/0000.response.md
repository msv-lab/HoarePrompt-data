Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Variable Initialization**: The code initializes several global variables (`cut_off`, `cut_off_str`, and `power_of_10`) outside the function `func_1`, but it assumes these variables are already defined and correctly initialized. If these variables are not properly initialized, the code will fail with runtime errors.

2. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` does not validate the format of `code_str` beyond its length. If the input does not conform to the expected pattern (e.g., it is not a string of digits), the function may produce incorrect results or raise exceptions.

3. **Logic for Year Calculation**: The logic for calculating the year from the abbreviation is flawed. Specifically, the way `cut_off_str` and `cut_off` are used to adjust the year is not robust enough to handle all edge cases. For example, consider the following cases:
   - **IAO'9999**: The code should return 9999, but it might not due to incorrect adjustments.
   - **IAO'1**: The code should return 1991, but it might not due to incorrect handling of the base year and the cut-off values.

To ensure the code is correct, it should:
- Properly initialize all necessary variables.
- Validate the input format.
- Correctly handle the logic for year calculation to ensure it works for all valid inputs.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
