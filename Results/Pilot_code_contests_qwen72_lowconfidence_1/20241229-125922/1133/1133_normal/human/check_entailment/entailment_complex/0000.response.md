Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Global Variables Initialization**:
   - The program uses global lists `cut_off` and `cut_off_str`, which are not properly initialized within the function `func_1`. These lists are crucial for the logic of the function, and their initialization outside the function can lead to issues if they are not set up correctly.

2. **Handling of Abbreviations**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to handle abbreviations of the form "IAO'y", where 'y' is a string of digits. However, the function directly uses the `code_str` without validating its format. While the problem description guarantees valid input, the function should still ensure that it processes the input correctly.
   - The logic for determining the correct year from the abbreviation is not straightforward and relies on the precomputed `cut_off` and `cut_off_str` arrays. The way these arrays are computed and used in the function does not clearly match the problem's requirements for determining the shortest valid abbreviation that has not been used before.

3. **Year Calculation Logic**:
   - The program attempts to concatenate the last character of `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and then adjusts `tmp` if it is less than `cut_off[code_len - 1]`. However, this approach does not align with the problem's requirement to find the shortest valid abbreviation that has not been used before.
   - The logic for adding `power_of_10[code_len - 1]` to `tmp` if it is less than `cut_off[code_len - 1]` is not clearly explained and does not seem to correctly handle the requirement of finding the next available year.

4. **Example Outputs**:
   - For the example inputs provided, the program's logic does not guarantee that it will produce the correct outputs. For instance, for the input "IAO'15", the program should output 2015, but the way it calculates `tmp` and adjusts it may not always produce the correct result.

To summarize, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the year from the given abbreviation as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
