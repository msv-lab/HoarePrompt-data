You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: International Abbreviation Olympiad takes place annually starting from 1989. Each year the competition receives an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y stands for some number of consequent last digits of the current year. Organizers always pick an abbreviation with non-empty string y that has never been used before. Among all such valid abbreviations they choose the shortest one and announce it to be the abbreviation of this year's competition.

For example, the first three Olympiads (years 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively) received the abbreviations IAO'9, IAO'0 and IAO'1, while the competition in 2015 received an abbreviation IAO'15, as IAO'5 has been already used in 1995.

You are given a list of abbreviations. For each of them determine the year it stands for.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of abbreviations to process. 

Then n lines follow, each containing a single abbreviation. It's guaranteed that each abbreviation contains at most nine digits.

Output

For each abbreviation given in the input, find the year of the corresponding Olympiad.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = input()
base = 1989
m = 9
power_of_10 = [10 ** i for i in range(1, 1 + m)]
cut_off = [0] + power_of_10
for i in range(1, m):
    cut_off[i] += cut_off[i - 1]
cut_off = [base + cut for cut in cut_off]
cut_off_str = [str(cut_off[i])[:-(i + 1)] for i in range(1 + m)]
for _ in range(n):
    print(func_1(raw_input().split("'")[1]))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: code_str is a string representing an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y is a non-empty string of digits and the length of y is at most nine.
def func_1(code_str):
    code_len = len(code_str)
    tmp = int(cut_off_str[code_len - 1] + code_str)
    if (tmp < cut_off[code_len - 1]) :
        tmp += power_of_10[code_len - 1]
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`code_str` is a string representing an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y is a non-empty string of digits and the length of y is at most nine, `code_len` is between 5 and 13 inclusive, `tmp` is an integer formed by concatenating the character at index `code_len - 1` of `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. If `tmp` is less than `cut_off[code_len - 1]`, `tmp` is updated to `tmp + power_of_10[code_len - 1]` and remains less than or equal to the value of `cut_off[code_len - 1]`.
    return tmp
    #The program returns an integer `tmp` which is formed by concatenating the character at index `code_len - 1` of `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. If `tmp` is less than `cut_off[code_len - 1]`, `tmp` is updated to `tmp + power_of_10[code_len - 1]` and remains less than or equal to the value of `cut_off[code_len - 1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `code_str` which is expected to be in the form "IAO'y" where 'y' is a non-empty string of digits with a maximum length of nine. It returns an integer `tmp` which is formed by concatenating the last character of a global variable `cut_off_str` with `code_str` and converting the result to an integer. If `tmp` is less than the corresponding value in a global list `cut_off` at index `code_len - 1` (where `code_len` is the length of `code_str`), `tmp` is incremented by the value in another global list `power_of_10` at the same index. This ensures that the returned `tmp` is adjusted to meet the condition of being greater than or equal to `cut_off[code_len - 1]`. However, the code assumes the existence of `cut_off_str`, `cut_off`, and `power_of_10` without defining them, which could lead to runtime errors if these variables are not properly initialized. Additionally, the function does not validate the format of `code_str` beyond its length, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not conform to the expected pattern.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
