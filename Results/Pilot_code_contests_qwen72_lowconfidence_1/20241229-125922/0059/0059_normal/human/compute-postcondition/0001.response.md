The code initializes two `Counter` objects from the `collections` module, named `dom` and `vyezd`. These counters will be used to count occurrences of elements, but they are currently empty.

The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 30, and for each of the `n` teams, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers within the range 1 to 100, representing the colors of the home and guest uniforms, respectively. This part of the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, and for each of the n teams, hi and ai are distinct integers where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, representing the colors of the home and guest uniforms, respectively; `dom` is an empty Counter object; `vyezd` is an empty Counter object.**
