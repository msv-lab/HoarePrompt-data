The value of `n` is updated to the value obtained from `input()`. The precondition specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30. After the code executes, `n` will hold the value provided by the user, which should still satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 30. The values of `hi` and `ai` remain unchanged and still represent the colors of the home and guest uniforms, respectively, for each of the `n` teams.

Output State: **n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, and for each of the n teams, hi and ai are distinct integers where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, representing the colors of the home and guest uniforms, respectively.**
