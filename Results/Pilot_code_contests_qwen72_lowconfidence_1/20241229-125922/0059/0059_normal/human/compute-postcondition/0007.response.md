The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are already input integers, so this code effectively updates their values. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `i` is 1, `dom` is a Counter object with `{a: 1}`, `vyezd` is a Counter object with `{b: 1}`, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
