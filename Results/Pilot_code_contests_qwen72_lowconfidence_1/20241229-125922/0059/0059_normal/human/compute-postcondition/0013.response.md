The value of `vyezd[b]` is incremented by 1. Since `vyezd` is a Counter object initially containing `{b: 2}`, after the increment, `vyezd[b]` will be 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `i` is 2, `dom` is a Counter object with `{a: 3}` if `a` is the same as the key in the initial state, otherwise `dom` is a Counter object with `{a: 2, a: 1}`, `vyezd` is a Counter object with `{b: 3}`, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `n` must be greater than 2**
