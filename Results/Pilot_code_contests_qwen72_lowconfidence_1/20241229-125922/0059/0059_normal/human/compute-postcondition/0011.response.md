The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splitting them by whitespace, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This updates the values of `a` and `b` to new input integers, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `i` is 2, `dom` is a Counter object with `{a: 2}`, `vyezd` is a Counter object with `{b: 2}`, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `n` must be greater than 2**
