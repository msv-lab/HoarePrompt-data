The value of `otv` is updated by adding `vyezd[i]` to its current value. Given that `otv` was initially set to `2 * vyezd[i]`, after the addition, `otv` will be equal to `3 * vyezd[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dom` is a Counter object with at least three keys, `vyezd` is a Counter object with counts of each `b` value read from input, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, the total number of entries in `dom` and `vyezd` combined is `n`, `otv` is equal to `3 * vyezd[i]`, `i` is the third key in `dom`**.
