The code `vyezd[b] += 1` increments the count of the key `b` in the `vyezd` Counter object by 1. Since `vyezd` was initially an empty Counter object, this means that after the execution of the code, `vyezd` will have a single entry with key `b` and value 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `i` is 0, `dom` is a Counter object with `{a: 1}`, `vyezd` is a Counter object with `{b: 1}`, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
