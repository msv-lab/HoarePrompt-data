The code snippet `dom[a] += 1` increments the count of the key `a` in the `Counter` object `dom` by 1. Since `a` is an input integer, its value is not specified, but the effect is that the count for `a` in `dom` increases by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30
- `i` is 1
- `dom` is a Counter object with `{a: 1}`
- `vyezd` is a Counter object with `{b: 1}`
- `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet:
- The count for the key `a` in `dom` is now `dom[a] = 1 + 1 = 2`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `i` is 1, `dom` is a Counter object with `{a: 2}`, `vyezd` is a Counter object with `{b: 1}`, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
