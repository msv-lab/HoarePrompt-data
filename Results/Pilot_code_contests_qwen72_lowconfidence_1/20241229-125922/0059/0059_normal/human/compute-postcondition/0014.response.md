Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dom` is a Counter object with counts of each `a` value read from input, `vyezd` is a Counter object with counts of each `b` value read from input, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, and the total number of entries in `dom` and `vyezd` combined is `n`.**
