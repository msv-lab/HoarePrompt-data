The value of `otv` is updated by adding the value of `vyezd[i]` to its current value. Since `otv` was already equal to `vyezd[i]`, after this operation, `otv` is equal to `2 * vyezd[i]`. The values of `n`, `dom`, `vyezd`, `hi`, `ai`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dom` is a Counter object with at least one key, `vyezd` is a Counter object with counts of each `b` value read from input, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, the total number of entries in `dom` and `vyezd` combined is `n`, `otv` is equal to `2 * vyezd[i]`, `i` is the second key in `dom`**
