Functionality: ** The function reads the number of teams `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 30) and then reads `n` pairs of integers representing the home and away uniform colors for each team. It ensures that the home and away uniform colors are distinct integers within the range 1 to 100. The function calculates the total number of conflicts, where a conflict occurs when the home uniform color of one team matches the away uniform color of another team. The final state of the program is that the total number of conflicts (`otv`) is printed. The function does not return any value. If the input values do not meet the specified constraints (e.g., `n` is out of range, or `hi` and `ai` are not distinct), the behavior of the function is undefined and may lead to incorrect results. **
