The value of `vyezd[b]` is incremented by 1. Since `b` is an input integer, the exact new value of `vyezd[b]` depends on the initial value of `b` in the `vyezd` Counter. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `i` is 1, `dom` is a Counter object with `{a: 2}`, `vyezd` is a Counter object with `{b: 1}` updated to `{b: 2}`, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
