The code snippet prints the value of `otv`. This operation does not alter any variables or state within the program. Therefore, all the conditions and values from the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dom` is a Counter object with counts of each `a` value read from input, `vyezd` is a Counter object with counts of each `b` value read from input, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, the total number of entries in `dom` and `vyezd` combined is `n`, `otv` is the sum of `vyezd[i]` for all keys `i` in `dom`.**
