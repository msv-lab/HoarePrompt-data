To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the provided code and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30.
- `dom` is a Counter object with counts of each `a` value read from input.
- `vyezd` is a Counter object with counts of each `b` value read from input.
- `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100.
- The total number of entries in `dom` and `vyezd` combined is `n`.
- `otv` is 0.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in dom:
    otv += vyezd[i]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each key `i` in the `dom` Counter object.
   - For each key `i`, the value `vyezd[i]` is added to `otv`.

2. **Output State After All Iterations**:
   - The loop will execute for each key in `dom`.
   - Since the total number of entries in `dom` and `vyezd` combined is `n`, and assuming each key in `dom` has a corresponding entry in `vyezd`, the loop will iterate `len(dom)` times.
   - After the loop finishes, `otv` will be the sum of `vyezd[i]` for all keys `i` in `dom`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30.
- `dom` is a Counter object with counts of each `a` value read from input.
- `vyezd` is a Counter object with counts of each `b` value read from input.
- `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100.
- The total number of entries in `dom` and `vyezd` combined is `n`.
- `otv` is the sum of `vyezd[i]` for all keys `i` in `dom`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dom` is a Counter object with counts of each `a` value read from input, `vyezd` is a Counter object with counts of each `b` value read from input, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, the total number of entries in `dom` and `vyezd` combined is `n`, `otv` is the sum of `vyezd[i]` for all keys `i` in `dom`.**
