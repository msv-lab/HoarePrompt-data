The values of `a` and `b` are assigned from the user input, which is split into two integers. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `i` is 0, `dom` is an empty Counter object, `vyezd` is an empty Counter object, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
