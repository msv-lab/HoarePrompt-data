To ensure the loop executes, we need to verify the conditions that allow the loop to start and continue. The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will iterate from 0 to n-1, provided that `n` is a positive integer.

Given the state before the loop:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30.
- `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100.
- `dom` is an empty Counter object.
- `vyezd` is an empty Counter object.

For the loop to execute:
1. `n` must be greater than 0. Given the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, this condition is already satisfied.
2. The loop variable `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Since the initial state already ensures that `n` is within the required range, no adjustments are needed for `n`. However, we need to specify the initial value of `i` and the state of the counters `dom` and `vyezd`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `i` is 0, `dom` is an empty Counter object, `vyezd` is an empty Counter object, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100**
