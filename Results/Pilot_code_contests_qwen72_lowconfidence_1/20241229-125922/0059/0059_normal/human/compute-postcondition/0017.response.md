The value of `otv` is updated by adding the value of `vyezd[i]` to its current value, which was initially 0. The key `i` is the first key in `dom`, and since `vyezd` is a Counter object with counts of each `b` value read from input, `vyezd[i]` represents the count of the value associated with the key `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dom` is a Counter object with at least one key, `vyezd` is a Counter object with counts of each `b` value read from input, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, the total number of entries in `dom` and `vyezd` combined is `n`, `otv` is now equal to `vyezd[i]`, `i` is the first key in `dom`**
