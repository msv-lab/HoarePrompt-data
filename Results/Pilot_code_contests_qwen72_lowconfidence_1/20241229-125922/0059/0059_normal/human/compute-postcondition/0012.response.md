The value of `dom[a]` is incremented by 1. Since `a` is an input integer, its value is not specified in the initial state, but it will be used as a key in the `Counter` object `dom`. The initial state specifies that `dom` is a `Counter` object with `{a: 2}`. After executing the code, `dom[a]` will be 3 if `a` is the same as the key `a` in the initial state. If `a` is a different integer, a new entry will be added to `dom` with the key `a` and the value 1.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `i` is 2, `dom` is a Counter object with `{a: 3}` if `a` is the same as the key in the initial state, otherwise `dom` is a Counter object with `{a: 2, a: 1}` (where the second `a` is the input integer), `vyezd` is a Counter object with `{b: 2}`, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `n` must be greater than 2**
