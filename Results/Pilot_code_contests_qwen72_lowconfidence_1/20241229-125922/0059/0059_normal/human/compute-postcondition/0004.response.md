The code snippet `dom[a] += 1` updates the `Counter` object `dom` by incrementing the count of the key `a` by 1. The value of `a` is an input integer, and since `dom` was initially an empty `Counter` object, this will be the first time a value is added to `dom`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30
- `i` is 0
- `dom` now contains the key `a` with a count of 1
- `vyezd` is an empty Counter object
- `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `i` is 0, `dom` is a Counter object with `{a: 1}`, `vyezd` is an empty Counter object, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
