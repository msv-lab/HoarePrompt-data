Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the use of `raw_input()` and `input()` is outdated and should be replaced with `input()` for both Python 3 compatibility and to ensure correct functionality. Additionally, the logic for counting the number of times the host team wears the guest uniform is flawed.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
1 2
2 4
3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will fail because it uses `raw_input()` which is not supported in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.

### Corrected Version of the Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that should work correctly:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    (dom, vyezd) = (Counter(), Counter())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        dom[a] += 1
        vyezd[b] += 1
    otv = 0
    for i in dom:
        otv += vyezd[i]
    print(otv)

func()
```

This version uses `input()` and correctly processes the input and output as specified in the problem description. However, the original program does not meet these requirements, hence the correctness is **False**.
