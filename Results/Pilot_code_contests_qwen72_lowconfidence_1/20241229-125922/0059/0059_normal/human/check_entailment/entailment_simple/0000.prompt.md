You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Manao works on a sports TV. He's spent much time watching the football games of some country. After a while he began to notice different patterns. For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.

There are n teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of n·(n - 1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.

You know the colors of the home and guest uniform for each team. For simplicity, the colors are numbered by integers in such a way that no two distinct colors have the same number. Help Manao find the answer to his question.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contains a pair of distinct space-separated integers hi, ai (1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100) — the colors of the i-th team's home and guest uniforms, respectively.

Output

In a single line print the number of games where the host team is going to play in the guest uniform.

Examples

Input

3
1 2
2 4
3 4


Output

1


Input

4
100 42
42 100
5 42
100 5


Output

5


Input

2
1 2
1 2


Output

0

Note

In the first test case the championship consists of 6 games. The only game with the event in question is the game between teams 2 and 1 on the stadium of team 2.

In the second test sample the host team will have to wear guest uniform in the games between teams: 1 and 2, 2 and 1, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 2 (the host team is written first).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, and for each of the n teams, hi and ai are distinct integers where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, representing the colors of the home and guest uniforms, respectively.
def func():
    n = input()
    dom, vyezd = Counter(), Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        dom[a] += 1
        
        vyezd[b] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dom` is a Counter object with counts of each `a` value read from input, `vyezd` is a Counter object with counts of each `b` value read from input, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, and the total number of entries in `dom` and `vyezd` combined is `n`.
    otv = 0
    for i in dom:
        otv += vyezd[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dom` is a Counter object with counts of each `a` value read from input, `vyezd` is a Counter object with counts of each `b` value read from input, `hi` and `ai` are distinct integers for each of the n teams, where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100, the total number of entries in `dom` and `vyezd` combined is `n`, `otv` is the sum of `vyezd[i]` for all keys `i` in `dom`.
    print(otv)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
