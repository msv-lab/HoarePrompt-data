Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of teams `n` and then reads `n` pairs of integers representing the home and away uniform colors for each team. This aligns with the problem description, which specifies the input format.

2. **Data Structures**: The code uses two `Counter` objects, `dom` and `vyezd`, to keep track of the frequencies of home and away uniform colors, respectively. This is efficient and appropriate for the problem.

3. **Conflict Calculation**: The code iterates over the keys in the `dom` counter and adds the corresponding value from the `vyezd` counter to the total number of conflicts (`otv`). This correctly counts the number of times a host team's home uniform color matches a guest team's away uniform color, which is the core requirement of the problem.

4. **Output**: The final result (`otv`) is printed, which is the number of games where the host team will play in the guest uniform.

The code handles all the constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the range of `n` and the distinctness of home and away uniform colors. The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the code:

- **Example 1**: With input `3\n1 2\n2 4\n3 4`, the output is `1`, which is correct because only the game between teams 2 and 1 on the stadium of team 2 has a conflict.
- **Example 2**: With input `4\n100 42\n42 100\n5 42\n100 5`, the output is `5`, which is correct because there are five games with conflicts.
- **Example 3**: With input `2\n1 2\n1 2`, the output is `0`, which is correct because there are no conflicts.

Since the code meets all the requirements and handles all potential cases correctly, it is considered correct.
