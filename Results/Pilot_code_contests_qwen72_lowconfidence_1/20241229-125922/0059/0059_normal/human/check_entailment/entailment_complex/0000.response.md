Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of teams `n` and ensures that `2 ≤ n ≤ 30`.
   - It then reads `n` pairs of integers `(hi, ai)` for each team, where `1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100` and `hi` and `ai` are distinct for each team.

2. **Counting Uniform Colors:**
   - The program uses two `Counter` objects, `dom` and `vyezd`, to count the occurrences of home and guest uniform colors, respectively.
   - For each team, it increments the count of the home uniform color in `dom` and the guest uniform color in `vyezd`.

3. **Calculating Conflicts:**
   - The program initializes a variable `otv` to 0, which will store the total number of conflicts.
   - It iterates over each key `i` in the `dom` counter and adds the corresponding count from `vyezd` to `otv`. This step effectively counts the number of times a host team's home uniform color matches the guest uniform color of another team.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `otv`, which represents the total number of games where the host team will play in the guest uniform.

### Why It Meets the Problem Description:
- **Correct Logic:** The program correctly identifies and counts the number of games where the host team's home uniform color matches the guest uniform color of another team. This is exactly what the problem description requires.
- **Constraints Handling:** The program assumes valid input, which is consistent with the problem description stating that the input will be valid and within the specified constraints.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as when there are no conflicts (e.g., when all home and guest uniform colors are distinct).

### Example Verification:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    3
    1 2
    2 4
    3 4
    ```
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: The only conflict occurs when team 2 (home uniform 2) plays against team 1 (guest uniform 2).

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    4
    100 42
    42 100
    5 42
    100 5
    ```
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: Conflicts occur in the games between teams: 1 and 2, 2 and 1, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 2.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    2
    1 2
    1 2
    ```
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: There are no conflicts because the home and guest uniform colors are distinct for each team.

Given these points, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
