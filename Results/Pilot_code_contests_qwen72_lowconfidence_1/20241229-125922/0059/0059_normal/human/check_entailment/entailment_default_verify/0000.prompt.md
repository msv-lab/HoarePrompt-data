You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Manao works on a sports TV. He's spent much time watching the football games of some country. After a while he began to notice different patterns. For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.

There are n teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of n·(n - 1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.

You know the colors of the home and guest uniform for each team. For simplicity, the colors are numbered by integers in such a way that no two distinct colors have the same number. Help Manao find the answer to his question.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contains a pair of distinct space-separated integers hi, ai (1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100) — the colors of the i-th team's home and guest uniforms, respectively.

Output

In a single line print the number of games where the host team is going to play in the guest uniform.

Examples

Input

3
1 2
2 4
3 4


Output

1


Input

4
100 42
42 100
5 42
100 5


Output

5


Input

2
1 2
1 2


Output

0

Note

In the first test case the championship consists of 6 games. The only game with the event in question is the game between teams 2 and 1 on the stadium of team 2.

In the second test sample the host team will have to wear guest uniform in the games between teams: 1 and 2, 2 and 1, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 2 (the host team is written first).
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = input()
    (dom, vyezd) = (Counter(), Counter())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        dom[a] += 1
        vyezd[b] += 1
    otv = 0
    for i in dom:
        otv += vyezd[i]
    print(otv)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly. In Python 3, `input()` returns a string, so the variable `n` should be converted to an integer using `int()`. Additionally, `raw_input()` is not available in Python 3; instead, `input()` should be used. These issues can lead to errors when running the program in Python 3. Here’s a corrected version of the relevant parts:

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
```

Furthermore, the logic in the program is also flawed. The program uses `Counter` objects to count the occurrences of home and guest uniform colors, but it does not correctly account for the specific condition where the home uniform color of the host team matches the guest uniform color of the visiting team. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
1 2
2 4
3 4
```

The expected output is `1`, but the program might produce a different result due to the incorrect logic. The program should iterate through all pairs of teams and check if the home uniform color of the host team matches the guest uniform color of the visiting team. If it does, increment the count. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    colors = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (home, guest) = map(int, input().split())
        colors.append((home, guest))
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j and colors[i][0] == colors[j][1]:
                count += 1
    
    print(count)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program follows the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads the number of teams `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 30) and then reads `n` pairs of integers representing the home and away uniform colors for each team. It ensures that the home and away uniform colors are distinct integers within the range 1 to 100. The function calculates the total number of conflicts, where a conflict occurs when the home uniform color of one team matches the away uniform color of another team. The final state of the program is that the total number of conflicts (`otv`) is printed. The function does not return any value. If the input values do not meet the specified constraints (e.g., `n` is out of range, or `hi` and `ai` are not distinct), the behavior of the function is undefined and may lead to incorrect results.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
