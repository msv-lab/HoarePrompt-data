Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is very large (up to \(10^{12}\)). The loop `for i in range(w)` only iterates up to `w`, which is at most \(10^5\). However, the number of draws `y` could be much larger than `w`. This means the program might miss valid solutions where the number of draws is greater than `w`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1000000000000 1000000000000 1 1
```
Here, the team has played \(10^{12}\) games and scored \(10^{12}\) points, with each win and draw giving 1 point. The correct solution would be:
```
0 1000000000000 0
```
However, the program will not find this solution because it only checks up to `w` (which is 1 in this case), and thus will incorrectly output `-1`.
