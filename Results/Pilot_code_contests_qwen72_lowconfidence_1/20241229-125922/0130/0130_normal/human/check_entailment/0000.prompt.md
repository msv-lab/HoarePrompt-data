You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The football season has just ended in Berland. According to the rules of Berland football, each match is played between two teams. The result of each match is either a draw, or a victory of one of the playing teams. If a team wins the match, it gets w points, and the opposing team gets 0 points. If the game results in a draw, both teams get d points.

The manager of the Berland capital team wants to summarize the results of the season, but, unfortunately, all information about the results of each match is lost. The manager only knows that the team has played n games and got p points for them.

You have to determine three integers x, y and z — the number of wins, draws and loses of the team. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If there is no suitable triple (x, y, z), report about it.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, p, w and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{12}, 0 ≤ p ≤ 10^{17}, 1 ≤ d < w ≤ 10^{5}) — the number of games, the number of points the team got, the number of points awarded for winning a match, and the number of points awarded for a draw, respectively. Note that w > d, so the number of points awarded for winning is strictly greater than the number of points awarded for draw.

Output

If there is no answer, print -1.

Otherwise print three non-negative integers x, y and z — the number of wins, draws and losses of the team. If there are multiple possible triples (x, y, z), print any of them. The numbers should meet the following conditions: 

  * x ⋅ w + y ⋅ d = p, 
  * x + y + z = n. 

Examples

Input


30 60 3 1


Output


17 9 4


Input


10 51 5 4


Output


-1


Input


20 0 15 5


Output


0 0 20

Note

One of the possible answers in the first example — 17 wins, 9 draws and 4 losses. Then the team got 17 ⋅ 3 + 9 ⋅ 1 = 60 points in 17 + 9 + 4 = 30 games.

In the second example the maximum possible score is 10 ⋅ 5 = 50. Since p = 51, there is no answer.

In the third example the team got 0 points, so all 20 games were lost.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    [n, p, w, d] = [int(i) for i in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
    x = -1
    y = -1
    z = -1
    done = 0
    for i in range(w):
        if (p - i * d) % w == 0:
            j = (p - i * d) // w
            if i + j <= n:
                (x, y, z) = (j, i, n - j - i)
                done = 1
                break
    if done == 1:
        print(str(x) + ' ' + str(y) + ' ' + str(z))
    else:
        print(-1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
