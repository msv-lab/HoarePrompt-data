Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the range of the loop where the program checks for possible solutions is limited to `range(w)`, which is not sufficient for large values of `n` and `p`. This can lead to incorrect results or missing valid solutions. For example, consider the following input:

```
1000000000000 1000000000000 2 1
```

For this input, the correct solution would be `x = 500000000000`, `y = 0`, and `z = 500000000000`. However, the loop in the program only iterates up to `w - 1`, which is 1 in this case. Therefore, the program will not find this solution and will incorrectly output `-1`.

To fix this issue, the loop should iterate over a more appropriate range, such as `range(n + 1)`, to ensure that all possible values of `y` are checked. Here is a corrected version of the loop:

```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    if (p - i * d) % w == 0:
        j = (p - i * d) // w
        if i + j <= n:
            (x, y, z) = (j, i, n - j - i)
            done = 1
            break
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases.
