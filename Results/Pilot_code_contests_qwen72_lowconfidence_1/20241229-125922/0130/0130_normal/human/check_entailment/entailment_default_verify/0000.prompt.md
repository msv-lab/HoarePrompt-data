You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The football season has just ended in Berland. According to the rules of Berland football, each match is played between two teams. The result of each match is either a draw, or a victory of one of the playing teams. If a team wins the match, it gets w points, and the opposing team gets 0 points. If the game results in a draw, both teams get d points.

The manager of the Berland capital team wants to summarize the results of the season, but, unfortunately, all information about the results of each match is lost. The manager only knows that the team has played n games and got p points for them.

You have to determine three integers x, y and z — the number of wins, draws and loses of the team. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If there is no suitable triple (x, y, z), report about it.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, p, w and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{12}, 0 ≤ p ≤ 10^{17}, 1 ≤ d < w ≤ 10^{5}) — the number of games, the number of points the team got, the number of points awarded for winning a match, and the number of points awarded for a draw, respectively. Note that w > d, so the number of points awarded for winning is strictly greater than the number of points awarded for draw.

Output

If there is no answer, print -1.

Otherwise print three non-negative integers x, y and z — the number of wins, draws and losses of the team. If there are multiple possible triples (x, y, z), print any of them. The numbers should meet the following conditions: 

  * x ⋅ w + y ⋅ d = p, 
  * x + y + z = n. 

Examples

Input


30 60 3 1


Output


17 9 4


Input


10 51 5 4


Output


-1


Input


20 0 15 5


Output


0 0 20

Note

One of the possible answers in the first example — 17 wins, 9 draws and 4 losses. Then the team got 17 ⋅ 3 + 9 ⋅ 1 = 60 points in 17 + 9 + 4 = 30 games.

In the second example the maximum possible score is 10 ⋅ 5 = 50. Since p = 51, there is no answer.

In the third example the team got 0 points, so all 20 games were lost.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    [n, p, w, d] = [int(i) for i in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
    x = -1
    y = -1
    z = -1
    done = 0
    for i in range(w):
        if (p - i * d) % w == 0:
            j = (p - i * d) // w
            if i + j <= n:
                (x, y, z) = (j, i, n - j - i)
                done = 1
                break
    if done == 1:
        print(str(x) + ' ' + str(y) + ' ' + str(z))
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is very large (up to \(10^{12}\)). The loop `for i in range(w)` only iterates up to `w`, which is at most \(10^5\). However, the number of draws `y` could be much larger than `w`. This means the program might miss valid solutions where the number of draws is greater than `w`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1000000000000 1000000000000 1 1
```
Here, the team has played \(10^{12}\) games and scored \(10^{12}\) points, with each win and draw giving 1 point. The correct solution would be:
```
0 1000000000000 0
```
However, the program will not find this solution because it only checks up to `w` (which is 1 in this case), and thus will incorrectly output `-1`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integers `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^12`, `0 ≤ p ≤ 10^17`, `1 ≤ d < w ≤ 10^5`. It attempts to find non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` such that `x * w + y * d = p` and `x + y + z = n`. If such integers exist, the function prints `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by spaces. If no such integers exist, the function prints `-1`. After the function executes, the values of `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` remain unchanged, and the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `done` will either reflect the found solution or remain `-1` and `0` respectively if no solution was found.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
