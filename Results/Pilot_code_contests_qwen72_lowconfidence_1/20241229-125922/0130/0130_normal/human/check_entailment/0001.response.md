Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the loop condition. It iterates over `range(w)`, which limits the number of iterations to `w`. However, the number of draws (`i`) could potentially be much larger than `w`, especially for large values of `n` and `p`. This means the program might miss valid solutions where the number of draws is greater than `w`.

For example, consider the input:
```
10 20 3 2
```
The correct output should be:
```
4 4 2
```
However, the program will not find this solution because it only checks up to `i = 2` (since `w = 3`). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
