You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The football season has just ended in Berland. According to the rules of Berland football, each match is played between two teams. The result of each match is either a draw, or a victory of one of the playing teams. If a team wins the match, it gets w points, and the opposing team gets 0 points. If the game results in a draw, both teams get d points.

The manager of the Berland capital team wants to summarize the results of the season, but, unfortunately, all information about the results of each match is lost. The manager only knows that the team has played n games and got p points for them.

You have to determine three integers x, y and z — the number of wins, draws and loses of the team. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If there is no suitable triple (x, y, z), report about it.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, p, w and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{12}, 0 ≤ p ≤ 10^{17}, 1 ≤ d < w ≤ 10^{5}) — the number of games, the number of points the team got, the number of points awarded for winning a match, and the number of points awarded for a draw, respectively. Note that w > d, so the number of points awarded for winning is strictly greater than the number of points awarded for draw.

Output

If there is no answer, print -1.

Otherwise print three non-negative integers x, y and z — the number of wins, draws and losses of the team. If there are multiple possible triples (x, y, z), print any of them. The numbers should meet the following conditions: 

  * x ⋅ w + y ⋅ d = p, 
  * x + y + z = n. 

Examples

Input


30 60 3 1


Output


17 9 4


Input


10 51 5 4


Output


-1


Input


20 0 15 5


Output


0 0 20

Note

One of the possible answers in the first example — 17 wins, 9 draws and 4 losses. Then the team got 17 ⋅ 3 + 9 ⋅ 1 = 60 points in 17 + 9 + 4 = 30 games.

In the second example the maximum possible score is 10 ⋅ 5 = 50. Since p = 51, there is no answer.

In the third example the team got 0 points, so all 20 games were lost.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, p, w, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ p ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ d < w ≤ 10^5.
def func():
    [n, p, w, d] = [int(i) for i in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
    x = -1
    y = -1
    z = -1
    done = 0
    for i in range(w):
        if (p - i * d) % w == 0:
            j = (p - i * d) // w
            if i + j <= n:
                x, y, z = j, i, n - j - i
                done = 1
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5. After the loop, if there exists an integer `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `w`) such that `(p - i * d) % w == 0` and `i + (p - i * d) // w ≤ n`, then `x` is set to `(p - i * d) // w`, `y` is set to `i`, `z` is set to `n - (p - i * d) // w - i`, and `done` is set to 1. If no such `i` exists, `x`, `y`, `z` remain -1, and `done` remains 0.
    if (done == 1) :
        print(str(x) + ' ' + str(y) + ' ' + str(z))
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5. If there exists an integer `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `w`) such that `(p - i * d) % w == 0` and `i + (p - i * d) // w ≤ n`, then `x` is set to `(p - i * d) // w`, `y` is set to `i`, `z` is set to `n - (p - i * d) // w - i`, and `done` is set to 1. Otherwise, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain -1, and `done` remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^12`, `0 ≤ p ≤ 10^17`, `1 ≤ d < w ≤ 10^5`. It attempts to find non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` such that `x * w + y * d = p` and `x + y + z = n`. If such integers exist, the function prints `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by spaces. If no such integers exist, the function prints `-1`. After the function executes, the values of `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` remain unchanged, and the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `done` will either reflect the found solution or remain `-1` and `0` respectively if no solution was found.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
