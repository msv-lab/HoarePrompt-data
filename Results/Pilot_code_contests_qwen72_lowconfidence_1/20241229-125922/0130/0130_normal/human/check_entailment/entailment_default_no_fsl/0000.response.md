Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the loop `for i in range(w)` limits the search for the number of draws to the range from 0 to `w-1`. This is a significant limitation because the number of draws can theoretically be much larger than `w-1`, especially for large values of `n` and `p`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
100 200 5 1
```
Here, `n = 100`, `p = 200`, `w = 5`, and `d = 1`. The correct solution would be:
- `x = 40` (wins)
- `y = 0` (draws)
- `z = 60` (losses)

However, the program will only check for `i` (number of draws) from 0 to 4 (since `w = 5`). This means it will not find the correct solution and will incorrectly print `-1`.

To fix this, the loop should iterate over a more appropriate range, such as `range(n+1)`, to ensure that all possible values of `y` (number of draws) are considered. Here is a corrected version of the loop:

```python
import sys

def func():
    [n, p, w, d] = [int(i) for i in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
    x = -1
    y = -1
    z = -1
    done = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):  # Iterate over all possible values of y (number of draws)
        if (p - i * d) % w == 0:
            j = (p - i * d) // w
            if i + j <= n:
                (x, y, z) = (j, i, n - j - i)
                done = 1
                break
    if done == 1:
        print(str(x) + ' ' + str(y) + ' ' + str(z))
    else:
        print(-1)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly handle all potential cases.
