The code reads four integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` respectively. The new values of these variables replace their previous values.

Output State: **`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5.**
