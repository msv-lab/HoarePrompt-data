The code assigns `-1` to the variable `y`. This impacts only the variable `y`, while the other variables (`n`, `p`, `w`, `d`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5; `x` is -1; `y` is -1**
