Postcondition: ***`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `n`, then `x` is set to `p // w`, `y` is set to 0, `z` is set to `n - p // w`, `done` is set to 1, `i` remains 0, and `j` is set to `p // w`. The condition `(p - i * d) % w == 0` holds, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + j` is greater than `n`, the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `done`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
