Postcondition: ***`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5. `i` is incremented by 1, `x`, `y`, `z`, `done`, and `j` remain unchanged unless the condition `(p - i * d) % w == 0` is met. If this condition is true, `j` is set to `(p - i * d) // w`. If `i + j` ≤ `n`, `x` is set to `j`, `y` is set to `i`, `z` is set to `n - j - i`, `done` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
