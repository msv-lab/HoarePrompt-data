Functionality: ** The function reads four integers `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^12`, `0 ≤ p ≤ 10^17`, `1 ≤ d < w ≤ 10^5`. It attempts to find non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` such that `x * w + y * d = p` and `x + y + z = n`. If such integers exist, the function prints `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by spaces. If no such integers exist, the function prints `-1`. After the function executes, the values of `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` remain unchanged, and the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `done` will either reflect the found solution or remain `-1` and `0` respectively if no solution was found. **
