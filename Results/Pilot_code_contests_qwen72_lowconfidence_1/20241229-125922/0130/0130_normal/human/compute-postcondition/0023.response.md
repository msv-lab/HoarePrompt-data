The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. Specifically:

- `x` is set to the value of `j`, which is calculated as `(p - i * d) // w`.
- `y` is set to the current value of `i`.
- `z` is set to `n - j - i`.

Given the initial state, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is set to `(p - i * d) // w`.

Let's list the updated values:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `i + 1`.
- `j` is set to `(p - (i + 1) * d) // w`.
- `x` is set to the value of `j`, which is `(p - (i + 1) * d) // w`.
- `y` is set to the new value of `i`, which is `i + 1`.
- `z` is set to `n - j - i`, which is `n - ((p - (i + 1) * d) // w) - (i + 1)`.

The variables `n`, `p`, `w`, `d`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated, while `done` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, `p` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `(p - (i + 1) * d) // w`, `x` is `(p - (i + 1) * d) // w`, `y` is `i + 1`, `z` is `n - ((p - (i + 1) * d) // w) - (i + 1)`, `done` remains unchanged.**
