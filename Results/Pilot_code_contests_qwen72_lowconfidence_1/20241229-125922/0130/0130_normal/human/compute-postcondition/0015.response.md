The value of `j` is updated based on the expression `(p - i * d) // w`. The variables `n`, `p`, `w`, `d`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `done` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `x`, `y`, `z`, `done`, and `j` remain unchanged.

After executing the code snippet:
- `j` is now equal to `(p - i * d) // w`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, `p` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `w` ≤ 10^5, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` < `w`, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `(p - i * d) // w`.**
