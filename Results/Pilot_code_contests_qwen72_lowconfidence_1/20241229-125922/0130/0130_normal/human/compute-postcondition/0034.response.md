The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d`. These parameters are integers with the following constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ p ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ d < w ≤ 10^5. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return logic is not provided in the problem statement.

Since the output logic is not detailed, I cannot provide a complete description of the return values. However, based on the given parameters and their constraints, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d`, all of which are integers. The parameters must satisfy the constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ p ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ d < w ≤ 10^5. The function returns a value based on these parameters.**
