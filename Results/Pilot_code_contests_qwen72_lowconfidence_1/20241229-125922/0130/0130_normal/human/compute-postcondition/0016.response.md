The code snippet updates the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the current values of `j`, `i`, and `n`.

1. `x` is assigned the value of `j`.
2. `y` is assigned the value of `i`.
3. `z` is assigned the value of `n - j - i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, `p` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `w` ≤ 10^5, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` < `w`, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is equal to `j`, `y` is equal to `i`, `z` is equal to `n - j - i`, `done` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `(p - i * d) // w`.**
