The provided code snippet prints the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` in a formatted string. The values of these variables are already defined in the initial state. The variables `n`, `p`, `w`, `d`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `done` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5. There exists an integer `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `w`) such that `(p - i * d) % w == 0` and `i + (p - i * d) // w ≤ n`. `x` is set to `(p - i * d) // w`, `y` is set to `i`, `z` is set to `n - (p - i * d) // w - i`, and `done` is set to 1.**
