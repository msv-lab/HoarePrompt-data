The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `n`.

- `x` is assigned the value of `j`.
- `y` is assigned the value of `i`.
- `z` is assigned the value of `n - j - i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers with specific constraints.
- `x` is -1.
- `y` is -1.
- `z` is -1.
- `done` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `(p - i * d) // w`, and the condition `(p - i * d) % w == 0` holds.
- `i + j` is less than or equal to `n`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `x` is now `j`, which is `(p - 0 * d) // w` or simply `p // w`.
- `y` is now `i`, which is 0.
- `z` is now `n - j - i`, which simplifies to `n - (p // w)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5; `x` is `p // w`; `y` is 0; `z` is `n - p // w`; `done` is 0; `i` is 0; `j` is `p // w`. Additionally, the condition `(p - i * d) % w == 0` holds, and `i + j` is less than or equal to `n`.**
