The code snippet provided assigns a value of 1 to the variable `done`. This impacts the state of the program by changing the value of `done` from its previous state (which could be any value, but typically would be 0 indicating an unfinished process) to 1, which often indicates completion or a true state.

Given the initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, `p` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `w` ≤ 10^5, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` < `w`, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is equal to `j`, `y` is equal to `i`, `z` is equal to `n - j - i`, `done` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `(p - i * d) // w`.

Code Snippet:
```
done = 1
```

The only change in the state due to this code snippet is the assignment of 1 to `done`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, `p` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `w` ≤ 10^5, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` < `w`, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is equal to `j`, `y` is equal to `i`, `z` is equal to `n - j - i`, `done` is 1, `j` is equal to `(p - i * d) // w`.**
