`j` is assigned the value `(p - i * d) // w`. Given the initial state, the expression `(p - i * d)` is divisible by `w`, so `j` will be an integer. The values of `n`, `p`, `d`, `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `done`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5; `x` is -1; `y` is -1; `z` is -1; `done` is 0; `i` is 0; `j` is `(p - i * d) // w`. Additionally, the condition `(p - i * d) % w == 0` holds.**
