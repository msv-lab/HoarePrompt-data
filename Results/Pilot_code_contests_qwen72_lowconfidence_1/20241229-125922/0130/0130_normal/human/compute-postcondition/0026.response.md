Postcondition: ***`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `done` remain unchanged, `j` is set to `(p - i * d) // w`. If `i + j <= n`, `j` is updated to `(p - (i + 1) * d) // w`, `x` is set to `(p - (i + 1) * d) // w`, `y` is set to `i + 1`, `z` is set to `n - ((p - (i + 1) * d) // w) - (i + 1)`, `done` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
