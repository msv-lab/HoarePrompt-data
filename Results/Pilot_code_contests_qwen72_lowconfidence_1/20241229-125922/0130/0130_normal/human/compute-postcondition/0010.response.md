The value of `done` is set to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5; `x` is `p // w`; `y` is 0; `z` is `n - p // w`; `done` is 1; `i` is 0; `j` is `p // w`. Additionally, the condition `(p - i * d) % w == 0` holds, and `i + j` is less than or equal to `n`.**
