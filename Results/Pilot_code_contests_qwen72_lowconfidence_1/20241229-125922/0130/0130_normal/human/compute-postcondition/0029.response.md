Postcondition: ***`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5. There exists an integer `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `w`) such that `(p - i * d) % w == 0` and `i + (p - i * d) // w ≤ n`. `x` is set to `(p - i * d) // w`, `y` is set to `i`, `z` is set to `n - (p - i * d) // w - i`, and `done` is set to 1. The current value of `done` is 1.***
