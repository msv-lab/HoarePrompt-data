To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the conditions that allow the loop to run at least once. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(w):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute at least one iteration, `w` must be greater than 0. Given the initial state:

- `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5.
- `x` is -1.
- `y` is -1.
- `z` is -1.
- `done` is 0.

The only variable that directly affects the loop's execution is `w`. Since the problem states that `1 ≤ w ≤ 10^5`, we can conclude that `w` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `w`.

However, we need to initialize the loop variable `i` to 0 for the loop to start correctly. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `z`, `done`, `n`, `p`, and `d`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5; `x` is -1; `y` is -1; `z` is -1; `done` is 0; `i` is 0**
