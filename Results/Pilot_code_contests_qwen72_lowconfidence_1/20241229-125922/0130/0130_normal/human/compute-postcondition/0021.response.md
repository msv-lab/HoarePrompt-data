To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `x`, `y`, `z`, `done`, and `j` remain unchanged unless the condition `(p - i * d) % w == 0` is met.
- If the condition `(p - i * d) % w == 0` is true, `j` is set to `(p - i * d) // w`.
- If `i + j` ≤ `n`, `x` is set to `j`, `y` is set to `i`, `z` is set to `n - j - i`, `done` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(w):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(w)` will continue as long as `i` is less than `w`.
2. **Increment of `i`**: At the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
3. **Condition Check**: The condition `(p - i * d) % w == 0` is checked. If this condition is true, `j` is updated, and further checks are made to update `x`, `y`, `z`, and `done`.

### Adjusting the State:
- **`i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, if `i` was some value `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- **Other Variables**: `x`, `y`, `z`, `done`, and `j` remain unchanged unless the condition `(p - i * d) % w == 0` is met. If the condition is met, `j` is set to `(p - i * d) // w`, and if `i + j` ≤ `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `done` are updated accordingly.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the other variables (`x`, `y`, `z`, `done`, and `j`) remain unchanged unless the specific condition is met.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5. `i` is incremented by 1, `x`, `y`, `z`, `done`, and `j` remain unchanged unless the condition `(p - (i+1) * d) % w == 0` is met. If this condition is true, `j` is set to `(p - (i+1) * d) // w`. If `i + 1 + j` ≤ `n`, `x` is set to `j`, `y` is set to `i + 1`, `z` is set to `n - j - (i + 1)`, `done` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
