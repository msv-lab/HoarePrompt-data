The value of `done` is set to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, `p` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `(p - (i + 1) * d) // w`, `x` is `(p - (i + 1) * d) // w`, `y` is `i + 1`, `z` is `n - ((p - (i + 1) * d) // w) - (i + 1)`, `done` is 1.**
