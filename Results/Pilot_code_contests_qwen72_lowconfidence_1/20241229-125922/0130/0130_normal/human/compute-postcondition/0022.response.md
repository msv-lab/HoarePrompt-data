The given code snippet assigns a new value to `j` using the formula `(p - i * d) // w`.

- `j` is calculated as `(p - i * d) // w`.
- No other variables are explicitly modified in this snippet.
- The conditions and the logic for updating `x`, `y`, `z`, `done`, and breaking out of the loop are not executed in this snippet.

Therefore, the only change in the state is the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `done` remain unchanged, `j` is set to `(p - i * d) // w`.**
