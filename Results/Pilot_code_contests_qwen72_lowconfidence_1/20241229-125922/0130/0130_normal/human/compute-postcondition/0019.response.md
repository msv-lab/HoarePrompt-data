Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, `p` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `w` ≤ 10^5, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` < `w`, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `(p - i * d) // w`. If `i + j` ≤ `n`, `x` is equal to `j`, `y` is equal to `i`, `z` is equal to `n - j - i`, `done` is 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
