Postcondition: ***`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5; `x` is -1; `y` is -1; `z` is -1; `done` is 0; `i` is 0; `j` is `(p - i * d) // w`. Additionally, the condition `(p - i * d) % w == 0` holds. The current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `n`.***
