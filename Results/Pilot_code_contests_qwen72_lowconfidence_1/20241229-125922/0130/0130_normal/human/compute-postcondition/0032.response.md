The code snippet `print(-1)` only outputs `-1` to the console and does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `p`, `w`, `d`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `done` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `p`, `w`, and `d` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^17, 1 ≤ `d` < `w` ≤ 10^5. `x`, `y`, and `z` remain -1, and `done` remains 0. There does not exist an integer `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `w`) such that `(p - i * d) % w == 0` and `i + (p - i * d) // w ≤ n`.**
