You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: The football season has just ended in Berland. According to the rules of Berland football, each match is played between two teams. The result of each match is either a draw, or a victory of one of the playing teams. If a team wins the match, it gets w points, and the opposing team gets 0 points. If the game results in a draw, both teams get d points.

The manager of the Berland capital team wants to summarize the results of the season, but, unfortunately, all information about the results of each match is lost. The manager only knows that the team has played n games and got p points for them.

You have to determine three integers x, y and z — the number of wins, draws and loses of the team. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If there is no suitable triple (x, y, z), report about it.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, p, w and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{12}, 0 ≤ p ≤ 10^{17}, 1 ≤ d < w ≤ 10^{5}) — the number of games, the number of points the team got, the number of points awarded for winning a match, and the number of points awarded for a draw, respectively. Note that w > d, so the number of points awarded for winning is strictly greater than the number of points awarded for draw.

Output

If there is no answer, print -1.

Otherwise print three non-negative integers x, y and z — the number of wins, draws and losses of the team. If there are multiple possible triples (x, y, z), print any of them. The numbers should meet the following conditions: 

  * x ⋅ w + y ⋅ d = p, 
  * x + y + z = n. 

Examples

Input


30 60 3 1


Output


17 9 4


Input


10 51 5 4


Output


-1


Input


20 0 15 5


Output


0 0 20

Note

One of the possible answers in the first example — 17 wins, 9 draws and 4 losses. Then the team got 17 ⋅ 3 + 9 ⋅ 1 = 60 points in 17 + 9 + 4 = 30 games.

In the second example the maximum possible score is 10 ⋅ 5 = 50. Since p = 51, there is no answer.

In the third example the team got 0 points, so all 20 games were lost.
Function definition:

def func():
```
