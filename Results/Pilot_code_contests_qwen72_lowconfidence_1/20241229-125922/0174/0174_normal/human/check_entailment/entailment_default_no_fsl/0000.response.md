Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from being correct according to the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling of Rows and Columns**:
   - The code uses a variable `rows` to keep track of the available rows, but it does not ensure that each row and each column has at most 2 targets. This is a critical requirement of the problem.
   - The code does not properly manage the placement of targets to ensure that no row or column exceeds the limit of 2 targets.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the input array `a` contains sequences that cannot be satisfied with the given constraints. For example, if the input is `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, it is impossible to place the targets such that each column has exactly 3 hits without violating the constraint that each row and column can have at most 2 targets.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Reusing Rows**:
   - The code attempts to reuse previously assigned rows for columns with 2 or 3 hits, but it does not always do so correctly. For example, if a column with 2 hits is processed before a column with 1 hit, the code might incorrectly reuse a row that should not be reused.

4. **Inconsistent Use of Data Structures**:
   - The code uses a `defaultdict` and a `deque` to manage the placement of targets, but it does not consistently update these data structures to reflect the current state of the grid. This can lead to incorrect placements and invalid configurations.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The code does not always produce the correct output format. For example, it might print `-1` and exit prematurely, leaving the output incomplete.

To be considered correct, the program must:
- Ensure that each row and each column has at most 2 targets.
- Handle all possible input cases, including edge cases where no valid configuration exists.
- Produce the correct output format, including the number of targets and their positions.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
