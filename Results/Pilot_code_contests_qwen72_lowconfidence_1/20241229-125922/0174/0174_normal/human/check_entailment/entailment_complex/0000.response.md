Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Handling of `a[i] == 0`:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case when `a[i] == 0`. According to the problem description, if `a[i] == 0`, it means the boomerang in column `i` should not hit any targets. However, the program does not check for this condition and simply skips it, which could lead to an incorrect configuration if the number of rows and columns is not managed correctly.

2. **Row and Column Constraints:**
   - The program uses a `rows` variable to keep track of the available rows for placing targets. However, it does not ensure that each row and each column has at most 2 targets. For example, if the program places a target in a row and then tries to place another target in the same row without checking the current count of targets in that row, it could violate the constraint.

3. **Memory Management:**
   - The `mem` dictionary is used to store and manage the targets, but it does not explicitly enforce the constraint that each row and column should have at most 2 targets. This could lead to invalid configurations if not managed correctly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the input might lead to an impossible configuration. For example, if `a` contains a sequence like `[3, 3, 3, 3]` for a small `n`, the program might not be able to find a valid configuration but does not handle this case properly.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
6
3 2 2 2 1 1
```
The program might output:
```
-1
```
However, a valid configuration exists for this input, but the program fails to find it due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
