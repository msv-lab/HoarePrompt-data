Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain edge cases and constraints properly. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of targets in a column is 0. According to the problem description, if a column has 0 targets, the boomerang should not hit any target, and the output should reflect this. However, the current implementation does not explicitly handle this case and might produce incorrect or incomplete output.

Additionally, the program does not correctly manage the placement of targets to ensure that no row or column exceeds the limit of 2 targets. For example, consider the following input:

```
4
0 2 2 2
```

The program should output a valid configuration where the boomerangs in columns 2, 3, and 4 each hit 2 targets, and the boomerang in column 1 does not hit any targets. However, the current implementation might fail to correctly place the targets or might place them in a way that violates the constraint of having at most 2 targets per row and column.

To further illustrate, let's consider another input:

```
6
0 2 3 1 1 1
```

The program should output a valid configuration where the boomerang in column 1 does not hit any targets, the boomerang in column 2 hits 2 targets, the boomerang in column 3 hits 3 targets, and the boomerangs in columns 4, 5, and 6 each hit 1 target. The current implementation might not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an incorrect or invalid configuration.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
