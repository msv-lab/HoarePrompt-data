You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: To improve the boomerang throwing skills of the animals, Zookeeper has set up an n × n grid with some targets, where each row and each column has at most 2 targets each. The rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. 

For each column, Zookeeper will throw a boomerang from the bottom of the column (below the grid) upwards. When the boomerang hits any target, it will bounce off, make a 90 degree turn to the right and fly off in a straight line in its new direction. The boomerang can hit multiple targets and does not stop until it leaves the grid.

<image>

In the above example, n=6 and the black crosses are the targets. The boomerang in column 1 (blue arrows) bounces 2 times while the boomerang in column 3 (red arrows) bounces 3 times.

The boomerang in column i hits exactly a_i targets before flying out of the grid. It is known that a_i ≤ 3.

However, Zookeeper has lost the original positions of the targets. Thus, he asks you to construct a valid configuration of targets that matches the number of hits for each column, or tell him that no such configuration exists. If multiple valid configurations exist, you may print any of them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The next line contains n integers a_1,a_2,…,a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 3).

Output

If no configuration of targets exist, print -1.

Otherwise, on the first line print a single integer t (0 ≤ t ≤ 2n): the number of targets in your configuration. 

Then print t lines with two spaced integers each per line. Each line should contain two integers r and c (1 ≤ r,c ≤ n), where r is the target's row and c is the target's column. All targets should be different. 

Every row and every column in your configuration should have at most two targets each.

Examples

Input


6
2 0 3 0 1 1


Output


5
2 1
2 5
3 3
3 6
5 6


Input


1
0


Output


0


Input


6
3 2 2 2 1 1


Output


-1

Note

For the first test, the answer configuration is the same as in the picture from the statement.

For the second test, the boomerang is not supposed to hit anything, so we can place 0 targets.

For the third test, the following configuration of targets matches the number of hits, but is not allowed as row 3 has 4 targets.

<image>

It can be shown for this test case that no valid configuration of targets will result in the given number of target hits.

```
Output hints: The function `func` processes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each element of `a` is between 0 and 3. It generates a series of operations based on the values in `a` and prints the results. Specifically, it handles three types of operations (1, 2, and 3) and maintains a list of output strings (`out`). For each element in `a`:
- If the element is 1, it appends a string indicating a row assignment and decrements the available rows.
- If the element is 2, it reuses a previously assigned row if available; otherwise, it prints `-1` and exits.
- If the element is 3, it attempts to assign two rows, reusing previously assigned rows if necessary; otherwise, it prints `-1` and exits.
The function ensures that the number of rows does not go below zero. After processing all elements in `a`, it prints the total number of operations and the list of operations. If at any point the function cannot perform the required operation, it prints `-1` and exits.

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
