You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: To improve the boomerang throwing skills of the animals, Zookeeper has set up an n × n grid with some targets, where each row and each column has at most 2 targets each. The rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. 

For each column, Zookeeper will throw a boomerang from the bottom of the column (below the grid) upwards. When the boomerang hits any target, it will bounce off, make a 90 degree turn to the right and fly off in a straight line in its new direction. The boomerang can hit multiple targets and does not stop until it leaves the grid.

<image>

In the above example, n=6 and the black crosses are the targets. The boomerang in column 1 (blue arrows) bounces 2 times while the boomerang in column 3 (red arrows) bounces 3 times.

The boomerang in column i hits exactly a_i targets before flying out of the grid. It is known that a_i ≤ 3.

However, Zookeeper has lost the original positions of the targets. Thus, he asks you to construct a valid configuration of targets that matches the number of hits for each column, or tell him that no such configuration exists. If multiple valid configurations exist, you may print any of them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The next line contains n integers a_1,a_2,…,a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 3).

Output

If no configuration of targets exist, print -1.

Otherwise, on the first line print a single integer t (0 ≤ t ≤ 2n): the number of targets in your configuration. 

Then print t lines with two spaced integers each per line. Each line should contain two integers r and c (1 ≤ r,c ≤ n), where r is the target's row and c is the target's column. All targets should be different. 

Every row and every column in your configuration should have at most two targets each.

Examples

Input


6
2 0 3 0 1 1


Output


5
2 1
2 5
3 3
3 6
5 6


Input


1
0


Output


0


Input


6
3 2 2 2 1 1


Output


-1

Note

For the first test, the answer configuration is the same as in the picture from the statement.

For the second test, the boomerang is not supposed to hit anything, so we can place 0 targets.

For the third test, the following configuration of targets matches the number of hits, but is not allowed as row 3 has 4 targets.

<image>

It can be shown for this test case that no valid configuration of targets will result in the given number of target hits.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to handle a specific edge case correctly. Consider the following input:

```
Input:
3
1 2 2
```

According to the problem description, the boomerang in column 1 should hit 1 target, and the boomerangs in columns 2 and 3 should each hit 2 targets. However, the program outputs:

```
Output:
3
3 1
3 2
2 3
```

This output is incorrect because:
- Column 1 has only one target at (3, 1), which is correct.
- Column 2 has one target at (3, 2), which is correct.
- Column 3 has one target at (2, 3), which is correct.

However, the boomerang in column 2 will hit the target at (3, 2) and then bounce to the right, hitting the target at (3, 3). This means that the boomerang in column 2 will actually hit 2 targets, which is correct. But the boomerang in column 3 will hit the target at (2, 3) and then bounce to the right, which will cause it to leave the grid without hitting another target. Therefore, the boomerang in column 3 will hit only 1 target, not 2 as required.

Thus, the program does not produce a valid configuration for this input, and hence it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
