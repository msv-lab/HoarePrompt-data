Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to handle a specific edge case correctly. Consider the following input:

```
Input:
3
1 2 2
```

According to the problem description, the boomerang in column 1 should hit 1 target, and the boomerangs in columns 2 and 3 should each hit 2 targets. However, the program outputs:

```
Output:
3
3 1
3 2
2 3
```

This output is incorrect because:
- Column 1 has only one target at (3, 1), which is correct.
- Column 2 has one target at (3, 2), which is correct.
- Column 3 has one target at (2, 3), which is correct.

However, the boomerang in column 2 will hit the target at (3, 2) and then bounce to the right, hitting the target at (3, 3). This means that the boomerang in column 2 will actually hit 2 targets, which is correct. But the boomerang in column 3 will hit the target at (2, 3) and then bounce to the right, which will cause it to leave the grid without hitting another target. Therefore, the boomerang in column 3 will hit only 1 target, not 2 as required.

Thus, the program does not produce a valid configuration for this input, and hence it is incorrect.
