The code snippet `rows -= 1` decrements the value of `rows` by 1. Given that the initial value of `rows` is `n`, the new value of `rows` will be `n - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (n, n)` and `'%d %d' % (n, mem[2][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, the current value of `a[i]` is 3, `mem[3]` is an empty deque or does not exist, `mem[2]` is a non-empty deque. If `rows` is less than 1, the program has terminated.**
