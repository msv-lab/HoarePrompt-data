To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and initial state:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). This means the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
   - `out` is an empty list.
   - `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
   - `cols` is `n`.
   - `rows` is `n`.
   - `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute because the range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` will be empty.
   - The variable `i` should start at `n - 1` and decrement by 1 until it reaches 0.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized correctly.

State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is an empty list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`**
