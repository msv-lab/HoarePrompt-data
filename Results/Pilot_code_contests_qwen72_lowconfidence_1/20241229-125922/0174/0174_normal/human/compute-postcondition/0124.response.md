The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. This means no further code is executed after this point, and the program ends. Since no variables are modified by the `exit()` call itself, the state of the variables remains unchanged from their state before the `exit()` call.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[3][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`. The value `-1` has been printed to the console. The program has terminated.**
