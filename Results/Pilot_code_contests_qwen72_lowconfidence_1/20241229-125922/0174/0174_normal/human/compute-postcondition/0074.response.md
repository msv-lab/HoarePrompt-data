The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. No further code is executed, and the program does not continue to modify any variables. The state of the variables remains as they were before the `exit()` call, except that the program itself has ended.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`, and the program has terminated.**
