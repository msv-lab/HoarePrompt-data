The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately, which means no further code is executed after this point. This affects the overall state of the program because it prevents any subsequent operations from occurring.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list that now includes the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[3][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`, and the program has terminated.**
