The code snippet appends a formatted string to the `out` list. The formatted string is created using the values of `rows` and the second element of the first deque in the `mem` dictionary under the key `1`.

Let's break down the changes:

1. **`out`**: The `out` list, which initially contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 2)`, now has an additional element appended to it. The new element is `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[1][0][1])`.

2. **`mem[1][0][1]`**: This expression accesses the second element of the first deque in the `mem` dictionary under the key `1`. Since the exact value of `mem[1][0][1]` is not specified, we will denote it as `mem_1_0_1`.

3. **Other Variables**: The values of `n`, `a`, `mem`, `cols`, `rows`, `mem2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 2)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem_1_0_1)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`.**
