The code prints `-1`. This operation does not change any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the value `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'n n'`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 1, and `rows` is less than 1, `-1` has been printed.**
