The code snippet provided is a simple print statement that outputs `-1`. This operation does not alter any of the variables or data structures mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 2)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 3`.**
