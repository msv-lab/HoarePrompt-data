The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. This means no further code is executed after this point, and the program ends.

Output State: **Program terminated, no changes to variables. `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 2)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 3`.**
