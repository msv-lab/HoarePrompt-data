The code prints `-1` and does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `out`, `mem`, `cols`, `rows`, `mem2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 2`.**
