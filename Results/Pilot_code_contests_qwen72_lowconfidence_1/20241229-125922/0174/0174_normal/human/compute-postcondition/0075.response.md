Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list. If `mem[1]` is not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)`. `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `mem[1]` is empty, the program terminates without modifying `out`.***
