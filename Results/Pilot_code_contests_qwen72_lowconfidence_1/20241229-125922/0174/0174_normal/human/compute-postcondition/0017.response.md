The code appends a formatted string to the list `out`. The string is composed of the first element in the deque stored at `mem[1]` and the value of `i + 1`.

- `mem[1][0][0]` is the first element of the first tuple in the deque at `mem[1]`.
- `i + 1` is calculated from the current value of `i`, which is `n - 1`.

Therefore, the string appended to `out` is `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], n)`.

The updated state of the variables is as follows:

- `out` now contains the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], n)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], n)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and `a[i]` is 2. Additionally, `mem[1]` contains at least one element (i.e., the deque associated with key 1 is non-empty).**
