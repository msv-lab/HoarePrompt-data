The code appends a formatted string to the list `out`. The string consists of the current value of `rows` and the value of `i + 1`. The values of `rows` and `i` are used in this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `out` is a list.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 2`.

After executing the code:
- The list `out` now includes the string `'%d %d' % (rows, i + 1)`.
- The value of `rows` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, i + 1)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`.**
