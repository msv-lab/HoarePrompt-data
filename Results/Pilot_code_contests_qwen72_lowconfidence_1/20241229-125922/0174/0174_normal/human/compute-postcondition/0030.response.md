The code snippet `print(-1)` only prints the value `-1` to the console and does not modify any of the variables in the current state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state, except that the value `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is `['%d %d' % (n, n), '%d %d' % (n, mem[3][0])]`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 3. Additionally, the `deque` object associated with the key `3` in `mem` is not empty. The current value of `rows` is less than 1. The value `-1` has been printed.**
