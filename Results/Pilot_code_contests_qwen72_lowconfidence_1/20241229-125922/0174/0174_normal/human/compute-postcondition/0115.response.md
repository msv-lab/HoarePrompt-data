The code appends a formatted string to the list `out`. This string is constructed using the first element of the deque in `mem[1]` and the value of `i + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `out` is a list.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- If `a[i] == 1`, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)`, `mem[1]` contains the list `[rows + 1, n - 1]`, and `rows` is updated to `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value.
- If `rows` is less than 1, the program state remains unchanged.
- If `a[i] != 1`, `mem[3]` now includes `n - 1`.
- If `a[i] == 2`, `mem[2]` contains the value `n - 1`.
- If `a[i] == 3` and `mem[3]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, mem[3][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[3]` is removed.
- If `a[i] == 3` and `mem[3]` is empty but `mem[2]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[2]` is removed.
- If `a[i] == 3` and both `mem[3]` and `mem[2]` are empty but `mem[1]` is not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[1][0][1])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[1]` is removed.
- If `rows < 1`, the program has terminated, either by printing `-1` or by returning.

After executing the code snippet:
```python
out.append('%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1))
```

The impact of this code is:
- The string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)` is appended to the list `out`.
- The value of `mem[1][0][0]` is used as the first part of the formatted string.
- The value of `i + 1` is used as the second part of the formatted string.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)` in addition to its previous contents, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`. If `a[i] == 1`, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)`, `mem[1]` contains the list `[rows + 1, n - 1]`, and `rows` is updated to `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value. If `rows` is less than 1, the program state remains unchanged. If `a[i] != 1`, `mem[3]` now includes `n - 1`. If `a[i] == 2`, `mem[2]` contains the value `n - 1`. If `a[i] == 3` and `mem[3]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, mem[3][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[3]` is removed. If `a[i] == 3` and `mem[3]` is empty but `mem[2]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[2]` is removed. If `a[i] == 3` and both `mem[3]` and `mem[2]` are empty but `mem[1]` is not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[1][0][1])` and `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)`, and the leftmost element of `mem[1]` is removed. If `rows < 1`, the program has terminated, either by printing `-1` or by returning.**
