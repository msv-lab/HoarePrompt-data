The provided code snippet defines a lambda function named `rints` which reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), splits the line into individual elements, and converts each element into an integer, returning the list of these integers.

- `n` remains a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` remains a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 3.
- A new function `rints` is defined, which can be used to read and convert a line of space-separated integers from standard input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 3, `rints` is a function that reads and converts a line of space-separated integers from standard input.**
