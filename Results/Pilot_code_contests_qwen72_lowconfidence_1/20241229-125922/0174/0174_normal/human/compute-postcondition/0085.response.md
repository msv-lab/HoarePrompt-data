The code appends a formatted string to the list `out`. The string is composed of the values of `rows` and `i + 1`.

- `rows` is either `n` or `n - 1`.
- `i` is `n - 2`, so `i + 1` is `n - 1`.

Therefore, the string appended to `out` will be either `'%d %d' % (n, n - 1)` or `'%d %d' % (n - 1, n - 1)`, depending on the value of `rows`.

The output state will include:
- `out` now contains one additional element, which is the formatted string.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 2`.**
