Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list. If `mem[1]` is not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[1][0][1])`, the leftmost element of `mem[1]` is removed, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`, and if `rows` < 1, the program execution is terminated. If `mem[1]` is empty, `-1` has been printed, and the program has terminated.***
