The given code snippet is:

```python
mem[2].append(i + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
   - `out` is a list.
   - `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
   - `cols` is `n`.
   - `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop.
   - `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `mem[1]` has had its leftmost element removed.
   - If `mem[1]` is not empty, the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)` is appended to `out`.
   - If `a[i] == 1`, `out` also contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)`, `mem[1]` contains the list `[rows + 1, n - 1]`, and `rows` is updated to `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value.
   - If `rows` is less than 1, the program state remains unchanged.
   - If `a[i] != 1`, `mem[3]` now includes `n - 1`.
   - If `a[i] == 2`, `mem[2]` contains the value `n - 1`.
   - If `a[i] == 3` and `mem[3]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, mem[3][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[3]` is removed.
   - If `a[i] == 3` and `mem[3]` is empty but `mem[2]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[2]` is removed.
   - If `a[i] == 3` and both `mem[3]` and `mem[2]` are empty but `mem[1]` is not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[1][0][1])` and `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)`, and the leftmost element of `mem[1]` is removed.
   - If `rows < 1`, the program has terminated, either by printing `-1` or by returning.
   - If `mem[1]` is empty, `-1` is printed, and the program has terminated.

2. **Impact of the Code Snippet:**
   - The code `mem[2].append(i + 1)` appends the value `i + 1` to the `deque` object `mem[2]`.

3. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The value of `i` is `n - 3`.
   - Therefore, `i + 1` is `n - 2`.
   - This value `n - 2` is appended to `mem[2]`.

### Output State:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `out` is a list.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `mem[1]` has had its leftmost element removed.
- `mem[2]` now contains `n - 2`.
- If `mem[1]` is not empty, the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)` is appended to `out`.
- If `a[i] == 1`, `out` also contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)`, `mem[1]` contains the list `[rows + 1, n - 1]`, and `rows` is updated to `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value.
- If `rows` is less than 1, the program state remains unchanged.
- If `a[i] != 1`, `mem[3]` now includes `n - 1`.
- If `a[i] == 2`, `mem[2]` contains the value `n - 1`.
- If `a[i] == 3` and `mem[3]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, mem[3][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[3]` is removed.
- If `a[i] == 3` and `mem[3]` is empty but `mem[2]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[2]` is removed.
- If `a[i] == 3` and both `mem[3]` and `mem[2]` are empty but `mem[1]` is not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[1][0][1])` and `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)`, and the leftmost element of `mem[1]` is removed.
- If `rows < 1`, the program has terminated, either by printing `-1` or by returning.
- If `mem[1]` is empty, `-1` is printed, and the program has terminated.
