The code appends a formatted string to the `out` list. This string is constructed using the values of `rows` and the first element of the deque stored in `mem[2]`.

- `rows` is equal to `n`.
- `mem[2]` is a non-empty deque, so `mem[2][0]` refers to the first element of this deque.

Thus, the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])` is appended to `out`.

The updated state of the program is as follows:

- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `out` now contains the strings `'%d %d' % (n, n)` and `'%d %d' % (n, mem[2][0])`.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n`.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- The current value of `a[i]` is 3.
- `mem[3]` is an empty deque or does not exist.
- `mem[2]` is a non-empty deque.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (n, n)` and `'%d %d' % (n, mem[2][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, the current value of `a[i]` is 3, `mem[3]` is an empty deque or does not exist, `mem[2]` is a non-empty deque.**
