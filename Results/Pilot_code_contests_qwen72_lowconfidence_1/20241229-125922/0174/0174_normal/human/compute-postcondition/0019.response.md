The code snippet `print(-1)` prints `-1` to the console and does not modify any of the variables in the current state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is an empty list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and `a[i]` is 2. Additionally, `mem[1]` is an empty deque. The value `-1` is printed to the console.**
