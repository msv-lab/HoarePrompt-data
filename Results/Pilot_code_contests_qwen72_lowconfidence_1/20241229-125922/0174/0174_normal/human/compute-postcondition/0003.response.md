`mem` is initialized as a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, which means it will create a new `deque` when a new key is accessed for the first time. `cols` and `rows` are both set to the value of `n`. The other variables (`a` and `out`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is an empty list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`**
