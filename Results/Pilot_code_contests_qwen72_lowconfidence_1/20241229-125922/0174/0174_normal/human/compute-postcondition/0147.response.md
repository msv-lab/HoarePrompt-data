The code snippet `mem[3].append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the deque object `mem[3]`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is initially `n - 3`.
- `mem[3]` is a deque object from the `defaultdict` `mem`.

Therefore, the value `i + 1` is calculated as `(n - 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.

The updated state reflects this change:

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`, `mem[3]` contains the element `n - 2`.**
