The line of code `mem[1].popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque object associated with the key `1` in the `defaultdict` `mem`.

Given the initial state, the only change this line of code will make is to modify the deque object stored in `mem[1]`. Since the exact contents of `mem[1]` are not specified, we can only say that its leftmost element has been removed. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `out`, `cols`, `rows`, `mem2`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[1][0][1])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects with the leftmost element of `mem[1]` removed, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`. If `rows` < 1, the program execution is terminated.**
