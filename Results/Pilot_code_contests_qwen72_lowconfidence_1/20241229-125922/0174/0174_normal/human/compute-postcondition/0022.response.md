The code `mem[1].popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque stored in `mem[1]`. This operation affects the contents of `mem[1]` but does not change the other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n`.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `a[i]` is 2.
- If `mem[1]` is non-empty, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], n)`, and `mem[1]` remains non-empty.
- If `mem[1]` is empty, the program terminates, `out` remains an empty list, and the value `-1` is printed to the console.

After executing the code:
- The leftmost element of `mem[1]` is removed.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` is 2, if `mem[1]` was non-empty before the operation, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], n)` and `mem[1]` is now one element shorter; if `mem[1]` was empty, the program terminates, `out` remains an empty list, and the value `-1` is printed to the console.**
