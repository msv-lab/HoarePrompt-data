The line of code appends a formatted string to the `out` list. The string is constructed from the current values of `rows` and `i + 1`. The value of `i + 1` is `n - 1` because `i` is `n - 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3
- `out` is a list that now includes the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)`
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects
- `cols` is `n`
- `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros
- `i` is `n - 2`

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list that now includes the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`**
