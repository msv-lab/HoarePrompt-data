The code appends a formatted string to the list `out`. This string is composed of the values of `rows` and the first element's second item in the `deque` stored in `mem[1]`.

Given:
- `rows` is `n`.
- `mem[1]` is not empty, so it contains at least one element which is a tuple, and we take the second item of this tuple (`mem[1][0][1]`).

Let's assume the first element in `mem[1]` is a tuple `(x, y)`. The value of `y` (i.e., `mem[1][0][1]`) is appended to `out` alongside `rows` (which is `n`).

Thus, the new string appended to `out` will be `'%d %d' % (n, mem[1][0][1])`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'n n'` and `'%d %d' % (n, mem[1][0][1])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 3. Additionally, `mem[3]` is an empty deque or does not exist, `mem[2]` is an empty deque or does not exist, and `mem[1]` is not empty.**
