The function `func` does not explicitly show its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, we can infer that the function should accept two parameters: `n` and `a`. 

- `n` is a positive integer with a range of 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 3.

Since the output is not specified in the problem statement, I cannot determine the exact return value. However, I can provide a general description based on common practices:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each element of `a` is between 0 and 3. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.** 

If you can provide more specific information about the output, I can refine this description accordingly.
