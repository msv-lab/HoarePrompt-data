The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. No further code is executed after this point. All variables retain their last known values, but the program does not continue beyond the `exit()` call.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'n n'` and `'%d %d' % (n, mem[1][0][1])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 3. Additionally, `mem[3]` is an empty deque or does not exist, `mem[2]` is an empty deque or does not exist, and `mem[1]` is not empty. The current value of `rows` is less than 1. `-1` is printed to the console. Program has terminated.**
