The code `mem[2].append(i + 1)` adds the value of `i + 1` to the deque associated with the key `2` in the `defaultdict` `mem`. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
   - `out` is a list. If `mem[1]` was not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)` if `mem[1]` still has elements.
   - `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
   - `cols` is `n`.
   - `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop.
   - `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `mem[1]` has one fewer element. If `mem[1]` is now empty, the program terminates without modifying `out`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - `i + 1` is calculated. Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` equals `n - 1`.
   - `mem[2].append(n - 1)` adds the value `n - 1` to the deque associated with the key `2` in `mem`.

3. **Updated State:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - `mem[2]` now contains the value `n - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list. If `mem[1]` was not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)` if `mem[1]` still has elements. `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`, `mem[1]` has one fewer element. If `mem[1]` is now empty, the program terminates without modifying `out`. `mem[2]` contains the value `n - 1`.**
