The code snippet `mem[2].append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `mem[2]`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `i + 1` evaluates to `n - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.
- `mem[2]` is a list of `n + 1` zeros initially, but this operation appends `n` to `mem[2]`.

Therefore, the updated `mem[2]` will be a list that starts with `n + 1` zeros followed by the integer `n`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` is 2, if `mem[1]` was non-empty before the operation, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], n)` and `mem[1]` is now one element shorter; if `mem[1]` was empty, the program terminates, `out` remains an empty list, and the value `-1` is printed to the console, `mem[2]` is a list of `n + 1` zeros followed by `n`.**
