The code appends a formatted string to the list `out`. The string consists of the current value of `rows` and the value of `i + 1`.

- `rows` is either `n` or `n - 1`.
- `i` is `n - 2`.

Therefore, the string appended to `out` is either `'%d %d' % (n, n - 1)` or `'%d %d' % (n - 1, n - 1)`, depending on the value of `rows`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 2`.**
