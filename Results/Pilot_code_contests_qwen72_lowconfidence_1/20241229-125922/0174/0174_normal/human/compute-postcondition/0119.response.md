The code `mem[1].popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque stored in `mem[1]`. Since `mem[1]` was not empty (as per the initial state), this operation will change the contents of `mem[1]`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `mem[1]` originally contained at least one element (since it is not empty).
- After executing `mem[1].popleft()`, the leftmost element is removed, reducing the length of `mem[1]` by 1.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`, `mem[1]` has had its leftmost element removed. If `mem[1]` is not empty, the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)` is appended to `out`. If `a[i] == 1`, `out` also contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)`, `mem[1]` contains the list `[rows + 1, n - 1]`, and `rows` is updated to `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value. If `rows` is less than 1, the program state remains unchanged. If `a[i] != 1`, `mem[3]` now includes `n - 1`. If `a[i] == 2`, `mem[2]` contains the value `n - 1`. If `a[i] == 3` and `mem[3]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, mem[3][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[3]` is removed. If `a[i] == 3` and `mem[3]` is empty but `mem[2]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[2]` is removed. If `a[i] == 3` and both `mem[3]` and `mem[2]` are empty but `mem[1]` is not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[1][0][1])` and `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)`, and the leftmost element of `mem[1]` is removed. If `rows < 1`, the program has terminated, either by printing `-1` or by returning. If `mem[1]` is empty, `-1` is printed, and the program has terminated.**
