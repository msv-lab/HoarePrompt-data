The code snippet `mem[3].append(i + 1)` adds the value `i + 1` to the deque `mem[3]`.

- `i` is `n - 1`, so `i + 1` is `n`.
- `mem[3]` was either an empty deque or did not exist before this operation. After this operation, `mem[3]` now contains the single element `n`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list. If `mem[3]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (n, n)` and `'%d %d' % (n, mem[3][0])`, and `mem[3]` is a deque with one fewer element. If `mem[3]` is empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (n, n)` and, if `mem[2]` is not empty, also `'%d %d' % (n, mem[2][0])`, and `mem[2]` is a deque with one fewer element. If `mem[2]` is empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (n, n)` and, if `mem[1]` is not empty, also `'%d %d' % (n, mem[1][0][1])`; otherwise, `out` is an empty list. `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` if `mem[3]`, `mem[2]`, or `mem[1]` is not empty; otherwise, `rows` is `n`. `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, the current value of `a[i]` is 3, `mem[3]` is a deque containing `[n]`, `mem[2]` is either an empty deque or does not exist, and `mem[1]` is either an empty deque or has one fewer element if it was not empty initially. The program has terminated if `rows` is less than 1 or `mem[1]` is empty.**
