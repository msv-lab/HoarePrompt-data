The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the standard input and then reads a list of integers `a` using the `rints` function. The variable `n` is updated with the integer value read from the input, and `a` is updated with the list of integers read by `rints`. The variable `out` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 â‰¤ `a_i` â‰¤ 3, `out` is an empty list**
