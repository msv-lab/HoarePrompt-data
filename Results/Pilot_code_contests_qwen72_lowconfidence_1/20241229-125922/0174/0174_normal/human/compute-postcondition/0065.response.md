To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the state transitions:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `out` is a list.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n`.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 1`.

### Conditions and Operations:
- If `a[i]` is 1:
  - `out` contains the string `'n n'`.
  - `mem[1]` now contains the list `[n, n]`.
  - `rows` is `n - 1`.
  - If `rows` is less than 1, `-1` has been printed, and the program has exited.
- If `a[i]` is 2:
  - If `mem[1]` was non-empty before the operation:
    - `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], n)`.
    - `mem[1]` is now one element shorter.
  - If `mem[1]` was empty, the program terminates, `out` remains an empty list, and the value `-1` is printed to the console.
  - `mem[2]` is a list of `n + 1` zeros followed by `n`.
- If `a[i]` is 3:
  - `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (n, n)`.
  - If `mem[3]` is not empty:
    - `out` also contains `'%d %d' % (n, mem[3][0])`.
    - `mem[3]` is a deque with one fewer element.
  - If `mem[3]` is empty and `mem[2]` is not empty:
    - `out` also contains `'%d %d' % (n, mem[2][0])`.
    - `mem[2]` is a deque with one fewer element.
  - If `mem[3]` and `mem[2]` are both empty and `mem[1]` is not empty:
    - `out` also contains `'%d %d' % (n, mem[1][0][1])`.
    - `mem[1]` is a deque with one fewer element.
  - `rows` is `n - 1` if `mem[3]`, `mem[2]`, or `mem[1]` is not empty; otherwise, `rows` is `n`.
  - `mem[3]` is a deque containing `[n]`.
  - `mem[2]` is either an empty deque or does not exist.
  - `mem[1]` is either an empty deque or has one fewer element if it was not empty initially.
- If `a[i]` is neither 2 nor 3, the program state remains unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `n - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be `n - 2`.
- The values of `out`, `mem`, `rows`, and `mem2` will depend on the operations performed in the current iteration based on the value of `a[i]`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 2`.**
