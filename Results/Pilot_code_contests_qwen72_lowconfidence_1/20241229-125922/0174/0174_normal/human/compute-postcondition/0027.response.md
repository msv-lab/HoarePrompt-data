The code appends a formatted string to the `out` list. The string is formed using the current values of `rows` and `i + 1`.

- `rows` is `n`.
- `i` is `n - 1`, so `i + 1` is `n`.

Thus, the string appended to `out` is `'%d %d' % (n, n)`, which evaluates to `'n n'`.

The `out` list, which was initially empty, now contains this string.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is `['%d %d' % (n, n)]`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 3. Additionally, the `deque` object associated with the key `3` in `mem` is not empty.**
