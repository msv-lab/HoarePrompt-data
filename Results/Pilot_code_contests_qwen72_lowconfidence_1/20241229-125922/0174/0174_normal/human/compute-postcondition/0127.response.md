The code snippet `mem[3].popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque associated with the key `3` in the `defaultdict` `mem`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[3][0])`.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value of `rows`.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 3`.

After executing `mem[3].popleft()`, the leftmost element of the deque `mem[3]` is removed. This does not affect any other variables.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[3][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects with the leftmost element of `mem[3]` removed, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value of `rows`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`.**
