The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. This means no further code will be executed, and the program will end without making any changes to the existing variables or state.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (n, n)` and `'%d %d' % (n, mem[2][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, the current value of `a[i]` is 3, `mem[3]` is an empty deque or does not exist, `mem[2]` is a non-empty deque, and `rows` is less than 1. The program has terminated.**
