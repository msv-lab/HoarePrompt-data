Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each element of `a` is between 0 and 3. It generates a series of operations based on the values in `a` and prints the results. Specifically, it handles three types of operations (1, 2, and 3) and maintains a list of output strings (`out`). For each element in `a`:
- If the element is 1, it appends a string indicating a row assignment and decrements the available rows.
- If the element is 2, it reuses a previously assigned row if available; otherwise, it prints `-1` and exits.
- If the element is 3, it attempts to assign two rows, reusing previously assigned rows if necessary; otherwise, it prints `-1` and exits.
The function ensures that the number of rows does not go below zero. After processing all elements in `a`, it prints the total number of operations and the list of operations. If at any point the function cannot perform the required operation, it prints `-1` and exits. **

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If the input list `a` contains a value other than 0, 1, 2, or 3, the function does not handle this case and may behave unpredictably.
- The function assumes that the input `n` and `a` are always valid and within the specified ranges. If these assumptions are violated, the function may raise exceptions or produce incorrect results.
