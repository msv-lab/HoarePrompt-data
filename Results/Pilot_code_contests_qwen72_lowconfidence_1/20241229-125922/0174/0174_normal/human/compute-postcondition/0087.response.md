The code snippet provided only contains a print statement that outputs `-1`. This does not alter the state of any variables in the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional fact that `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`, and `-1` has been printed.**
