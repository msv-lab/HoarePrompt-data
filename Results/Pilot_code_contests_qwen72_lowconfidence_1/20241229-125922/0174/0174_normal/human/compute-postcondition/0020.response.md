The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This means that no further code will be executed after this point, and the program will end.

Output State: **Program terminated, no further changes to variables. `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is an empty list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and `a[i]` is 2. Additionally, `mem[1]` is an empty deque. The value `-1` was printed to the console.**
