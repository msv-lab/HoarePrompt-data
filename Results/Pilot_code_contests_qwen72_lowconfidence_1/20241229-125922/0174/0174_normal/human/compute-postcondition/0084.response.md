The code `mem[3].popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque associated with the key `3` in the `defaultdict` `mem`.

- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `mem[3]` refers to the deque associated with the key `3`.
- `popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of this deque.

Since the exact elements in `mem[3]` are not specified, we can only say that the leftmost element of `mem[3]` has been removed. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list that now includes the strings `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, mem[3][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects with the leftmost element of `mem[3]` removed, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`. If `rows` < 1, the program has terminated.**
