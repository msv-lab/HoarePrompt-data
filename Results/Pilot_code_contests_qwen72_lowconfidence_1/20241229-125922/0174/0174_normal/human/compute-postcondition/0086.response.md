The code appends a formatted string to the `out` list. The string is constructed using the values of `rows` and the first element of the deque stored in `mem` at key `2`.

- `out` was initially a list containing one string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)`. After the execution, it will contain this original string plus the new string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, and `mem[2]` is assumed to be a non-empty deque from which the first element is used.
- The rest of the variables (`n`, `a`, `cols`, `rows`, `mem2`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 2`.**
