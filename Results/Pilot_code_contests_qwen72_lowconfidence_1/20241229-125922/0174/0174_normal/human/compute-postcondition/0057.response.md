The `exit()` function call causes the program to terminate immediately. This means no further operations in the program will be executed, and the state of the program remains unchanged from the initial state except for the termination of the program.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is an empty list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, the current value of `a[i]` is 3, `mem[3]` is an empty deque or does not exist, `mem[2]` is an empty deque or does not exist, and `mem[1]` is either an empty deque or does not exist. The program has terminated.**
