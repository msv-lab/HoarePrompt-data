The code snippet appends a formatted string to the `out` list. The string is constructed using the values of `rows` and `i + 1`. Given the initial state:

- `rows` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.

The formatted string is `'%d %d' % (rows, i + 1)`, which translates to `'%d %d' % (n, n)`. This string is then appended to the `out` list, which was initially empty.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `out` now contains the string `'%d %d' % (n, n)`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (n, n)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 3. Additionally, `mem[3]` is an empty deque or does not exist. The current value of `mem[2]` is a non-empty deque.**
