Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and `a[i]` is 2. If `mem[1]` is non-empty, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], n)`, and `mem[1]` remains non-empty. If `mem[1]` is empty, the program terminates, `out` remains an empty list, and the value `-1` is printed to the console.***
