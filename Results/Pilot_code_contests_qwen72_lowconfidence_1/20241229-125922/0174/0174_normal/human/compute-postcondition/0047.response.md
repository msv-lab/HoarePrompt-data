The code appends a formatted string to the `out` list. The string is composed of the values of `rows` and `i + 1`. Given that `rows` is equal to `n` and `i` is `n - 1`, the string appended to `out` will be `'%d %d' % (n, n)`, which results in a string like `'n n'` where `n` is the actual value of `n`.

Therefore, the `out` list, which was initially empty, now contains one element: the string `'n n'`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `mem`, `cols`, `rows`, `mem2`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'n n'`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 3. Additionally, `mem[3]` is an empty deque or does not exist, `mem[2]` is an empty deque or does not exist, and `mem[1]` is not empty.**
