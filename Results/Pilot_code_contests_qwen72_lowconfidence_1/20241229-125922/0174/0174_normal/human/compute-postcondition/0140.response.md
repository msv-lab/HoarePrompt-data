The value of `rows` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `rows` is either `n` or `n - 1`, after decrementing, `rows` will be either `n - 1` or `n - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 2)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem_1_0_1)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`. If `rows` is less than 1, the program has been terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition.**
