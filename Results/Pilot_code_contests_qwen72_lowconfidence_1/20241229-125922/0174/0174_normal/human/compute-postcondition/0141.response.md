The code snippet `mem[1].popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque object stored at key `1` in the `defaultdict` `mem`. This operation modifies the state of `mem` but does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 2)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem_1_0_1)`.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the operations inside the loop.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- If `rows` is less than 1, the program has been terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition.

After executing `mem[1].popleft()`, the leftmost element of the deque at `mem[1]` is removed. The specific value of the element removed is not known, but the deque at `mem[1]` will have one fewer element.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 2)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem_1_0_1)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects with the leftmost element of `mem[1]` removed, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`, if `rows` is less than 1, the program has been terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition.**
