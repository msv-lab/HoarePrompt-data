The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately, which means no further execution of the code occurs after this point. All variables retain their values up to the point of calling `exit()`. Since the `exit()` function does not alter any variables, the state of the program remains unchanged in terms of variable values.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 2)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem_1_0_1)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`. The program has been terminated.**
