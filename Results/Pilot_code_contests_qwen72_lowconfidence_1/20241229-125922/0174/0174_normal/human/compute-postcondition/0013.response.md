The code `mem[1].append([rows + 1, i + 1])` appends a new list `[rows + 1, i + 1]` to the deque associated with the key `1` in the `defaultdict` `mem`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3
- `out` is a list containing the string `'n n'`
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects
- `cols` is `n`
- `rows` is `n - 1`
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros
- `i` is `n - 1`
- The current value of `a[i]` is 1
- If `rows` is less than 1, `-1` has been printed, and the program has exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated value of `rows`

Let's calculate the result of the code snippet:

1. `rows + 1` evaluates to `(n - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.
2. `i + 1` evaluates to `(n - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.

So, the list `[n, n]` is appended to `mem[1]`.

The updated state is:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3
- `out` is a list containing the string `'n n'`
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, and `mem[1]` now contains the list `[n, n]`
- `cols` is `n`
- `rows` is `n - 1`
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros
- `i` is `n - 1`
- The current value of `a[i]` is 1
- If `rows` is less than 1, `-1` has been printed, and the program has exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated value of `rows`

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'n n'`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, and `mem[1]` now contains the list `[n, n]`, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 1. If `rows` is less than 1, `-1` has been printed, and the program has exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated value of `rows`.**
