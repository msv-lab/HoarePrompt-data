Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`. If `mem[2]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, i + 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[2]` is removed. If `mem[2]` is empty and `mem[1]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 2)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[1][0][1])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[1]` is removed. If `mem[2]` and `mem[1]` are both empty, `-1` is printed, and the program has terminated. If `rows` is less than 1, the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition.***
