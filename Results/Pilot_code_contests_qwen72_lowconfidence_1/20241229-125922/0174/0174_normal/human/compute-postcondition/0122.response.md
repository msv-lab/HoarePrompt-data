The provided code snippet appends a formatted string to the `out` list using the current values of `rows` and the first element of `mem[3]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `out` is a list.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- If `a[i] == 1`, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)`, `mem[1]` contains the list `[rows + 1, n - 1]`, and `rows` is updated to `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value.
- If `rows` is less than 1, the program state remains unchanged.
- If `a[i] != 1`, `mem[3]` now includes `n - 1`.
- If `a[i] == 2`, `mem[2]` contains the value `n - 1`.
- If `a[i] == 3` and `mem[3]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, mem[3][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[3]` is removed.
- If `a[i] == 3` and `mem[3]` is empty but `mem[2]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[2]` is removed.
- If `a[i] == 3` and both `mem[3]` and `mem[2]` are empty but `mem[1]` is not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[1][0][1])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[1]` is removed.
- If `rows < 1`, the program has terminated, either by printing `-1` or by returning.

After executing the code:
- The string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[3][0])` is appended to `out`.
- The value of `rows` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[3][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`.**
