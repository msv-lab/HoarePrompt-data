The `exit()` function call causes the program to terminate immediately. This means that no further code will be executed, and the program will end. Since the program terminates, the final state reflects the values just before the termination.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`, `-1` is printed, and the program has terminated.**
