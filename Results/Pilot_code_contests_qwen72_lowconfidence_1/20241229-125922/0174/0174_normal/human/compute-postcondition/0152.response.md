The provided code snippet is a print statement that outputs two pieces of information: the length of the list `out` and the contents of the list `out` itself, each element on a new line.

- `len(out)` computes the number of elements in the list `out`.
- `'\n'.join(out)` joins all elements in the list `out` into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

The variables `n`, `a`, `mem`, `rows`, and `mem2` are not directly affected by this print statement. The state of these variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list of strings generated during the loop, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects containing elements added during the loop, `rows` is `n - k` where `k` is the number of times `rows` is decremented, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
