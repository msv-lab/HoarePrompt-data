The `popleft()` method is called on the `deque` object associated with the key `3` in the `defaultdict` `mem`. This removes the leftmost element from this `deque`.

Given that the `deque` object associated with the key `3` in `mem` is not empty, after the `popleft()` operation, the `deque` will contain one fewer element.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is `['%d %d' % (n, n), '%d %d' % (n, mem[3][0])]`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 3. The `deque` object associated with the key `3` in `mem` has one fewer element.
