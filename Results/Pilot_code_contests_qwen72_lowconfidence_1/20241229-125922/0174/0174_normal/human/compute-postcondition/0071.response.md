The code snippet `mem[1].append([rows + 1, i + 1])` impacts the `mem` dictionary by appending a new list `[rows + 1, i + 1]` to the deque associated with the key `1`.

- The value of `rows + 1` depends on the initial value of `rows`, which can be `n - 1` or `n - 2`.
- The value of `i + 1` is `n - 1` since `i` is initially `n - 2`.

Therefore, the new list appended to `mem[1]` is `[rows + 1, n - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects with `mem[1]` containing the list `[rows + 1, n - 1]`, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value of `rows`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `rows` is less than 1, the program state remains unchanged.**
