The value of `rows` is decremented by 1. Since `rows` was initially either `n` or `n - 1`, after the decrement, `rows` will be either `n - 1` or `n - 2`. If `rows` is less than 1 after this operation, the program terminates without making any changes to the variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 2)`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value of `rows`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 3`. If `rows` is less than 1, the program terminates without making any changes to the variables.
