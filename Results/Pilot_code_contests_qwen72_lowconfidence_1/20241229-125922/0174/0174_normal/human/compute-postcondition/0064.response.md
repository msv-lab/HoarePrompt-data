Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `a[i]` is 1, `out` contains the string `'n n'`, `mem[1]` now contains the list `[n, n]`, `rows` is `n - 1`. If `rows` is less than 1, `-1` has been printed, and the program has exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated value of `rows`. If `a[i]` is not 1, and `a[i]` is 2, and `mem[1]` was non-empty before the operation, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], n)` and `mem[1]` is now one element shorter; if `mem[1]` was empty, the program terminates, `out` remains an empty list, and the value `-1` is printed to the console, `mem[2]` is a list of `n + 1` zeros followed by `n`. If `a[i]` is 3, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (n, n)` and possibly additional strings depending on the contents of `mem[3]`, `mem[2]`, and `mem[1]`. Specifically, if `mem[3]` is not empty, `out` also contains `'%d %d' % (n, mem[3][0])`, and `mem[3]` is a deque with one fewer element. If `mem[3]` is empty and `mem[2]` is not empty, `out` also contains `'%d %d' % (n, mem[2][0])`, and `mem[2]` is a deque with one fewer element. If `mem[3]` and `mem[2]` are both empty and `mem[1]` is not empty, `out` also contains `'%d %d' % (n, mem[1][0][1])`, and `mem[1]` is a deque with one fewer element. `rows` is `n - 1` if `mem[3]`, `mem[2]`, or `mem[1]` is not empty; otherwise, `rows` is `n`. `mem[3]` is a deque containing `[n]`, `mem[2]` is either an empty deque or does not exist, and `mem[1]` is either an empty deque or has one fewer element if it was not empty initially. The program has terminated if `rows` is less than 1 or `mem[1]` is empty. If `a[i]` is neither 2 nor 3, the program state remains unchanged.***
