Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list. If `mem[3]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows + 1, mem[3][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[3]` is removed. If `mem[3]` is empty and `mem[2]` is not empty, `out` contains the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[2]` is removed. If `mem[3]` is empty, `mem[2]` is empty, and `mem[1]` is not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[1][0][1])`, and the leftmost element of `mem[1]` is removed. In all cases, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value of `rows`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `rows < 1`, the program has terminated, either by printing `-1` or by returning.***
