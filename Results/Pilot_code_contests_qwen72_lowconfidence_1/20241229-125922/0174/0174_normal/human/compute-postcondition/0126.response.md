The code snippet `rows -= 1` decrements the value of `rows` by 1. The initial state specifies that `rows` is either `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop. After decrementing `rows` by 1, the new value of `rows` will be:

- If `rows` was `n`, then the new value of `rows` is `n - 1`.
- If `rows` was `n - 1`, then the new value of `rows` is `n - 2`.

Since the condition `if rows < 1` is not met (as per the initial state, the program would have terminated if `rows < 1`), the program continues executing.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[3][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value of `rows`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`.**
