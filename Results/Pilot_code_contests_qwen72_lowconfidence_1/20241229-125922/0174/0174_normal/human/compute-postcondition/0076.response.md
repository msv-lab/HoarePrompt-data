The code `mem[1].popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque stored in `mem[1]`. This operation modifies `mem[1]` by removing its first element.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `out` is a list. If `mem[1]` is not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)`.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- If `mem[1]` is empty, the program terminates without modifying `out`.

After executing `mem[1].popleft()`, the leftmost element of `mem[1]` is removed. If `mem[1]` was not empty before this operation, it will now have one fewer element.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list. If `mem[1]` was not empty, `out` contains the string `'%d %d' % (mem[1][0][0], i + 1)` if `mem[1]` still has elements. `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`, `mem[1]` has one fewer element. If `mem[1]` is now empty, the program terminates without modifying `out`.**
