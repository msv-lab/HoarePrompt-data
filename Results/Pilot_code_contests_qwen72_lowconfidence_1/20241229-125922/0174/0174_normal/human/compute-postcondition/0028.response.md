The code appends a formatted string to the `out` list. The string is created using the values of `rows` and the first element of the `deque` object associated with the key `3` in `mem`.

- `rows` is `n`.
- `mem[3][0]` is the first element of the deque associated with the key `3` in `mem`.

Thus, the string appended to `out` is `'%d %d' % (n, mem[3][0])`.

The updated `out` list now includes this new string.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is `['%d %d' % (n, n), '%d %d' % (n, mem[3][0])]`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 3. Additionally, the `deque` object associated with the key `3` in `mem` is not empty.**
