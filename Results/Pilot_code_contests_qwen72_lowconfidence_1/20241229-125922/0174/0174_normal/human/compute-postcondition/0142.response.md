The provided code snippet is `print(-1)`. This code prints `-1` to the console and does not alter the state of any variables. Since there are no changes to the variables, the initial state remains unchanged except for the fact that `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`, `-1` is printed.**
