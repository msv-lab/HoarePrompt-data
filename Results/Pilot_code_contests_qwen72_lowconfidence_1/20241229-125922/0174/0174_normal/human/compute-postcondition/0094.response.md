The provided code snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

Impacts:
- The value `-1` is printed to the console.
- No variables are modified by this code snippet.
- The state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing `-1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[1][0][1])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`.**
