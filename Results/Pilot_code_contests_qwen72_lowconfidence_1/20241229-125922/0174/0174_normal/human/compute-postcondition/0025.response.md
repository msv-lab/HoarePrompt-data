Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is an empty list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 3***
