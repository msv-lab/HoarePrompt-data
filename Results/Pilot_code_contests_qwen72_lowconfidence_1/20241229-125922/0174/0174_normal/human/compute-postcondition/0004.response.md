The code initializes a new list `mem2` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is an empty list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**
