The code snippet `mem[1].popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque stored in `mem[1]`. Since `mem[1]` is not empty, this operation will successfully remove one element from the deque.

- The initial state indicates that `mem[1]` is not empty, but it does not specify the exact contents of `mem[1]`. After the `popleft()` operation, `mem[1]` will have one fewer element.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `out`, `cols`, `rows`, `mem2`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `rows` is less than 1 leading to printing `-1` and terminating the program is not relevant to this specific code snippet, as the snippet only affects `mem[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'n n'` and `'%d %d' % (n, mem[1][0][1])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, the current value of `a[i]` is 3, `mem[3]` is an empty deque or does not exist, `mem[2]` is an empty deque or does not exist, `mem[1]` is not empty but has one fewer element.**
