Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'n n'` and `'%d %d' % (n, mem[1][0][1])` if `mem[1]` is not empty; otherwise, `out` is an empty list. `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` if `mem[1]` is not empty; otherwise, `rows` is `n`. `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, the current value of `a[i]` is 3, `mem[3]` is an empty deque or does not exist, `mem[2]` is an empty deque or does not exist, and `mem[1]` is either an empty deque or has one fewer element if it was not empty initially. The program has terminated if `mem[1]` is empty.***
