The code `mem[2].popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque associated with the key `2` in the `defaultdict` `mem`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value of `rows`.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- If `rows < 1`, `-1` has been printed.

After executing `mem[2].popleft()`, the leftmost element of the deque `mem[2]` is removed. The length of `mem[2]` is reduced by 1, and the next element in the deque (if any) becomes the new leftmost element.

The output state remains the same for all other variables and conditions, except for the change in `mem[2]`:

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, n - 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects with `mem[2]` having its leftmost element removed, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value of `rows`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`, if `rows < 1`, `-1` has been printed.**
