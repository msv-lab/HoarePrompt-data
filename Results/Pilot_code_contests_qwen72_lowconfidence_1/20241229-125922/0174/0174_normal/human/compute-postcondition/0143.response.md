The `exit()` function call causes the program to terminate immediately. This means no further code execution occurs after this point, and the program exits. The state of the variables does not change, but the program ends.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`, `-1` is printed, and the program has terminated.**
