The provided code snippet `print(-1)` will execute the print function, which outputs `-1` to the console. This does not alter any of the variables or data structures in the current state. However, since the code includes a `print(-1)` statement, it suggests the termination of the program, possibly indicating an error condition or a specific end state.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`, `-1` is printed, and the program has terminated.**
