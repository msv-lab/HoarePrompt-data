The value of `rows` is decremented by 1, changing from `n` to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the string `'n n'`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 1. If `rows` is less than 1, `-1` has been printed, and the program has exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated value of `rows`.**
