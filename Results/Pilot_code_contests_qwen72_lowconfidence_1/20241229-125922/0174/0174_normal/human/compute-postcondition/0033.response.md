The value of `rows` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `rows` is `n`, so after the decrement, `rows` becomes `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is `['%d %d' % (n, n), '%d %d' % (n, mem[3][0])]`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 3. Additionally, the `deque` object associated with the key `3` in `mem` is not empty. If `rows` is less than 1, the value `-1` has been printed and the program has terminated.**
