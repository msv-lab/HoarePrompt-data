The code snippet `print(-1)` prints `-1` to the console and does not alter any of the variables in the current state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the action of printing `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `i` is `n - 2`. `-1` has been printed.**
