The value of `rows` is decremented by 1. Since `rows` was initially equal to `n`, after the decrement, `rows` is now `n - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'n n'` and `'%d %d' % (n, mem[1][0][1])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n - 1`, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is 3. Additionally, `mem[3]` is an empty deque or does not exist, `mem[2]` is an empty deque or does not exist, and `mem[1]` is not empty. If `rows` is less than 1, `-1` is printed to the console and the program terminates.**
