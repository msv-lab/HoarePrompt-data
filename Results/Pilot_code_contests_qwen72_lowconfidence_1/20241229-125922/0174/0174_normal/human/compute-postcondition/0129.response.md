The code appends a new string to the `out` list, which is formatted using the values of `rows` and the first element of the `deque` object in `mem[2]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `out` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (rows, i + 1)`.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 3`.

After executing the code:
- The `out` list will contain an additional string `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3.
- `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, i + 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`.
- `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects.
- `cols` is `n`.
- `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop.
- `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 3`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 3, `out` is a list containing the strings `'%d %d' % (rows, i + 1)` and `'%d %d' % (rows, mem[2][0])`, `mem` is a `defaultdict` of `deque` objects, `cols` is `n`, `rows` is `n` or `n - 1` depending on the operations inside the loop, `mem2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 3`.**
