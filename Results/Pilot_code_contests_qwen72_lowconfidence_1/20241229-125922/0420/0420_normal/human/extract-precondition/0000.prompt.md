You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: There is a rectangular grid of n rows of m initially-white cells each.

Arkady performed a certain number (possibly zero) of operations on it. In the i-th operation, a non-empty subset of rows Ri and a non-empty subset of columns Ci are chosen. For each row r in Ri and each column c in Ci, the intersection of row r and column c is coloured black.

There's another constraint: a row or a column can only be chosen at most once among all operations. In other words, it means that no pair of (i, j) (i < j) exists such that <image> or <image>, where <image> denotes intersection of sets, and <image> denotes the empty set.

You are to determine whether a valid sequence of operations exists that produces a given final grid.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns of the grid, respectively.

Each of the following n lines contains a string of m characters, each being either '.' (denoting a white cell) or '#' (denoting a black cell), representing the desired setup.

Output

If the given grid can be achieved by any valid sequence of operations, output "Yes"; otherwise output "No" (both without quotes).

You can print each character in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

5 8
.#.#..#.
.....#..
.#.#..#.
#.#....#
.....#..


Output

Yes


Input

5 5
..#..
..#..
#####
..#..
..#..


Output

No


Input

5 9
........#
#........
..##.#...
.......#.
....#.#.#


Output

No

Note

For the first example, the desired setup can be produced by 3 operations, as is shown below.

<image>

For the second example, the desired setup cannot be produced, since in order to colour the center row, the third row and all columns must be selected in one operation, but after that no column can be selected again, hence it won't be possible to colour the other cells in the center column.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
