Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program only checks for partial overlaps of columns, but it does not consider the constraints on rows. The problem requires that no row or column can be chosen more than once across all operations. The current implementation only checks for overlaps in columns, but it does not ensure that the same row is not used in multiple operations, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
5 5
..#..
..#..
#####
..#..
..#..
```

The correct answer for this grid is "No" because to color the center row, all columns must be selected, but then no column can be selected again to color the other cells in the center column. However, the provided program would incorrectly output "Yes" because it only checks for column overlaps and does not enforce the constraint on rows.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fully adhere to the problem's constraints.
