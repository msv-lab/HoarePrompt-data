You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a rectangular grid of n rows of m initially-white cells each.

Arkady performed a certain number (possibly zero) of operations on it. In the i-th operation, a non-empty subset of rows Ri and a non-empty subset of columns Ci are chosen. For each row r in Ri and each column c in Ci, the intersection of row r and column c is coloured black.

There's another constraint: a row or a column can only be chosen at most once among all operations. In other words, it means that no pair of (i, j) (i < j) exists such that <image> or <image>, where <image> denotes intersection of sets, and <image> denotes the empty set.

You are to determine whether a valid sequence of operations exists that produces a given final grid.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns of the grid, respectively.

Each of the following n lines contains a string of m characters, each being either '.' (denoting a white cell) or '#' (denoting a black cell), representing the desired setup.

Output

If the given grid can be achieved by any valid sequence of operations, output "Yes"; otherwise output "No" (both without quotes).

You can print each character in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

5 8
.#.#..#.
.....#..
.#.#..#.
#.#....#
.....#..


Output

Yes


Input

5 5
..#..
..#..
#####
..#..
..#..


Output

No


Input

5 9
........#
#........
..##.#...
.......#.
....#.#.#


Output

No

Note

For the first example, the desired setup can be produced by 3 operations, as is shown below.

<image>

For the second example, the desired setup cannot be produced, since in order to colour the center row, the third row and all columns must be selected in one operation, but after that no column can be selected again, hence it won't be possible to colour the other cells in the center column.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter

def func():
    rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rint = lambda : int(stdin.readline())
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rstr_2d = lambda n: [rstr() for _ in range(n)]
    rint_2d = lambda n: [rint() for _ in range(n)]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    pr = lambda args, sep: stdout.write(sep.join(map(str, args)) + '\n')
    out = []
    (n, m) = rints()
    (grid, all, ans) = (rstr_2d(n), [], 'YES')
    for i in range(m):
        tem = set()
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[j][i] == '#':
                tem.add(j)
        if tem:
            for j in all:
                inter = tem.intersection(j)
                if inter:
                    if inter != tem:
                        ans = 'NO'
                    break
            if tem not in all:
                all.append(tem)
    print(ans)


```
Output hints: The function reads an integer grid size (n, m) and a grid of n strings, each of length m, containing characters '.' or '#'. It then processes the grid to check if any column contains a set of '#' characters that partially overlaps with any previously seen column's set of '#' characters. If such a partial overlap is found, the function outputs 'NO'. If no such partial overlap exists for any column, the function outputs 'YES'. The function also handles edge cases where columns contain no '#' characters, which are ignored in the comparison.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
