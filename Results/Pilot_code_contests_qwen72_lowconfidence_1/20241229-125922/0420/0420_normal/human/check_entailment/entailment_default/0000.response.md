Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code checks for partial overlaps between columns but does not ensure that the operations are valid according to the constraints mentioned in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Row and Column Constraints**: The problem states that a row or a column can only be chosen at most once among all operations. The current implementation only checks for partial overlaps between columns, but it does not enforce the constraint that a row can only be chosen once. This means that the code might incorrectly return 'YES' for grids that cannot be achieved by valid operations.

2. **Handling Rows**: The code focuses on columns and their intersections but does not explicitly handle the rows. This can lead to incorrect results for cases where the row constraints are violated.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code might miss edge cases where the grid configuration is complex, and the simple intersection check might not be sufficient to determine the validity of the operations.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

```
Input:
4 4
##..
##..
....
...#
```

In this case, the first two rows are identical, and the last row has a single black cell. According to the problem constraints, this configuration cannot be achieved because selecting the first two rows in one operation would prevent the selection of the last row in any subsequent operation. However, the provided code might not detect this and could incorrectly return 'YES'.

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to its incorrectness.
