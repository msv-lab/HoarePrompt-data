Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the same row is selected multiple times in different operations, which is against the problem's constraints. According to the problem, a row or column can only be chosen at most once among all operations. However, the current implementation does not enforce this constraint, leading to potential incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 4
....
#...
....
#...
```

This input should result in "No" because the second and fourth rows are both partially filled, which would require selecting the same row more than once, violating the problem's constraints. However, the given program might incorrectly output "Yes" because it does not properly check for the re-selection of rows or columns.
