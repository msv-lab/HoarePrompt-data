Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it checks the validity of the grid configuration. Specifically, the program only checks the intersection of sets of rows for each column, but it does not ensure that no column is used more than once across different operations. This can lead to incorrect results for certain grid configurations.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Input:
```
4 4
#...
...#
#...
...#
```

Expected Output:
```
No
```

Actual Output from the Program:
```
Yes
```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" because it does not correctly enforce the constraint that a column can only be chosen at most once among all operations. The grid configuration clearly requires multiple operations involving the same column, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
