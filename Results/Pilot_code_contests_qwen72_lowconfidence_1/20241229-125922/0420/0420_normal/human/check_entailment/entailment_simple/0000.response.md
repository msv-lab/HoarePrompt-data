Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem according to the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Column-Wise Processing**: The program processes the grid column by column, which is a reasonable approach. However, the logic for checking the validity of the operations is flawed.

2. **Intersection Check**: The program checks if the set of rows `tem` for a given column intersects with any set in `all`. If an intersection exists but is not equal to the entire set `tem`, it sets `ans` to 'NO'. This logic is incorrect because it fails to account for the possibility that multiple columns could be part of the same operation.

3. **Row and Column Constraints**: The problem states that a row or a column can only be chosen at most once among all operations. The program does not enforce this constraint correctly. It only checks if the set of rows for a column intersects with previously processed sets, but it does not ensure that no row or column is reused across different operations.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first example, the program might incorrectly identify a valid sequence of operations because it does not properly check the constraints.
   - For the second example, the program might fail to detect that the center row and column cannot be colored without violating the constraints.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Track which rows and columns have been used.
- Ensure that no row or column is used more than once.
- Verify that the final grid can be achieved by the allowed operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rint = lambda : int(stdin.readline())
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rstr_2d = lambda n: [rstr() for _ in range(n)]
    rint_2d = lambda n: [rint() for _ in range(n)]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    pr = lambda args, sep: stdout.write(sep.join(map(str, args)) + '\n')
    
    n, m = rints()
    grid = rstr_2d(n)
    used_rows = set()
    used_cols = set()
    ans = 'YES'
    
    for i in range(m):
        rows = set()
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[j][i] == '#':
                rows.add(j)
        
        if rows:
            if any(rows & used_rows):
                ans = 'NO'
                break
            used_rows.update(rows)
            used_cols.add(i)
    
    for j in range(n):
        cols = set()
        for i in range(m):
            if grid[j][i] == '#':
                cols.add(i)
        
        if cols:
            if any(cols & used_cols):
                ans = 'NO'
                break
            used_cols.update(cols)
            used_rows.add(j)
    
    print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- No row or column is used more than once.
- The final grid can be achieved by the allowed operations.

By following these steps, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.
