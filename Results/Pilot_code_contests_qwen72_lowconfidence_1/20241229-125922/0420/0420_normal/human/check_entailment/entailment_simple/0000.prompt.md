You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is a rectangular grid of n rows of m initially-white cells each.

Arkady performed a certain number (possibly zero) of operations on it. In the i-th operation, a non-empty subset of rows Ri and a non-empty subset of columns Ci are chosen. For each row r in Ri and each column c in Ci, the intersection of row r and column c is coloured black.

There's another constraint: a row or a column can only be chosen at most once among all operations. In other words, it means that no pair of (i, j) (i < j) exists such that <image> or <image>, where <image> denotes intersection of sets, and <image> denotes the empty set.

You are to determine whether a valid sequence of operations exists that produces a given final grid.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns of the grid, respectively.

Each of the following n lines contains a string of m characters, each being either '.' (denoting a white cell) or '#' (denoting a black cell), representing the desired setup.

Output

If the given grid can be achieved by any valid sequence of operations, output "Yes"; otherwise output "No" (both without quotes).

You can print each character in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

5 8
.#.#..#.
.....#..
.#.#..#.
#.#....#
.....#..


Output

Yes


Input

5 5
..#..
..#..
#####
..#..
..#..


Output

No


Input

5 9
........#
#........
..##.#...
.......#.
....#.#.#


Output

No

Note

For the first example, the desired setup can be produced by 3 operations, as is shown below.

<image>

For the second example, the desired setup cannot be produced, since in order to colour the center row, the third row and all columns must be selected in one operation, but after that no column can be selected again, hence it won't be possible to colour the other cells in the center column.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50. The grid is represented by a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters '.' or '#'.
def func():
    rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rint = lambda : int(stdin.readline())
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rstr_2d = lambda n: [rstr() for _ in range(n)]
    rint_2d = lambda n: [rint() for _ in range(n)]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    pr = lambda args, sep: stdout.write(sep.join(map(str, args)) + '\n')
    out = []
    n, m = rints()
    grid, all, ans = rstr_2d(n), [], 'YES'
    for i in range(m):
        tem = set()
        
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[j][i] == '#':
                tem.add(j)
        
        if tem:
            for j in all:
                inter = tem.intersection(j)
                if inter:
                    if inter != tem:
                        ans = 'NO'
                    break
            if tem not in all:
                all.append(tem)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list of sets, each set containing the indices of rows where the character at a specific column is '#'. If there exists any column `i` where the set of row indices `tem` intersects with any set in `all` but is not equal to that set, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'. If `tem` is empty for any column, it is not added to `all`. `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list.
    print(ans)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
