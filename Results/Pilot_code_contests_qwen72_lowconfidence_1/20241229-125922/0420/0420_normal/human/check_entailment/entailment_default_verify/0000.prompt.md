You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a rectangular grid of n rows of m initially-white cells each.

Arkady performed a certain number (possibly zero) of operations on it. In the i-th operation, a non-empty subset of rows Ri and a non-empty subset of columns Ci are chosen. For each row r in Ri and each column c in Ci, the intersection of row r and column c is coloured black.

There's another constraint: a row or a column can only be chosen at most once among all operations. In other words, it means that no pair of (i, j) (i < j) exists such that <image> or <image>, where <image> denotes intersection of sets, and <image> denotes the empty set.

You are to determine whether a valid sequence of operations exists that produces a given final grid.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns of the grid, respectively.

Each of the following n lines contains a string of m characters, each being either '.' (denoting a white cell) or '#' (denoting a black cell), representing the desired setup.

Output

If the given grid can be achieved by any valid sequence of operations, output "Yes"; otherwise output "No" (both without quotes).

You can print each character in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

5 8
.#.#..#.
.....#..
.#.#..#.
#.#....#
.....#..


Output

Yes


Input

5 5
..#..
..#..
#####
..#..
..#..


Output

No


Input

5 9
........#
#........
..##.#...
.......#.
....#.#.#


Output

No

Note

For the first example, the desired setup can be produced by 3 operations, as is shown below.

<image>

For the second example, the desired setup cannot be produced, since in order to colour the center row, the third row and all columns must be selected in one operation, but after that no column can be selected again, hence it won't be possible to colour the other cells in the center column.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter

def func():
    rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rint = lambda : int(stdin.readline())
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rstr_2d = lambda n: [rstr() for _ in range(n)]
    rint_2d = lambda n: [rint() for _ in range(n)]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    pr = lambda args, sep: stdout.write(sep.join(map(str, args)) + '\n')
    out = []
    (n, m) = rints()
    (grid, all, ans) = (rstr_2d(n), [], 'YES')
    for i in range(m):
        tem = set()
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[j][i] == '#':
                tem.add(j)
        if tem:
            for j in all:
                inter = tem.intersection(j)
                if inter:
                    if inter != tem:
                        ans = 'NO'
                    break
            if tem not in all:
                all.append(tem)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the same row is selected multiple times in different operations, which is against the problem's constraints. According to the problem, a row or column can only be chosen at most once among all operations. However, the current implementation does not enforce this constraint, leading to potential incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 4
....
#...
....
#...
```

This input should result in "No" because the second and fourth rows are both partially filled, which would require selecting the same row more than once, violating the problem's constraints. However, the given program might incorrectly output "Yes" because it does not properly check for the re-selection of rows or columns.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer grid size (n, m) and a grid of n strings, each of length m, containing characters '.' or '#'. It then processes the grid to check if any column contains a set of '#' characters that partially overlaps with any previously seen column's set of '#' characters. If such a partial overlap is found, the function outputs 'NO'. If no such partial overlap exists for any column, the function outputs 'YES'. The function also handles edge cases where columns contain no '#' characters, which are ignored in the comparison.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
