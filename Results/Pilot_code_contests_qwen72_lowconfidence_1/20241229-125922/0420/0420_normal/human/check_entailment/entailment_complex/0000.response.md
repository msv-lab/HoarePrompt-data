Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, which is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`.

2. **Processing the Grid:**
   - The program iterates over each column of the grid.
   - For each column, it collects the indices of the rows that contain a black cell (`'#'`).
   - These indices are stored in a set `tem`.

3. **Checking Overlaps:**
   - The program maintains a list `all` of sets, where each set represents the rows that were colored black in a previous column.
   - For each new set `tem`, it checks if it intersects with any set in `all`.
   - If an intersection exists and the intersection is not equal to `tem`, it means that the current set of rows partially overlaps with a previous set, which violates the problem's constraint. In this case, the program sets `ans` to `'NO'` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `tem` does not intersect with any set in `all`, it is added to `all`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all columns, the program prints `ans`, which will be `'YES'` if no partial overlaps were found, and `'NO'` otherwise.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Handling Constraints:**
  - The program correctly handles the constraints that a row or column can only be chosen at most once among all operations.
  - It ensures that no partial overlap exists between the sets of rows chosen in different operations.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles columns that do not contain any black cells (`'#'`). Such columns are ignored, which is consistent with the problem statement.

- **Input Validation:**
  - The problem assumes valid input, so the program does not need to handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer dimensions, grid with invalid characters). The program correctly processes the input as specified.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as required. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
