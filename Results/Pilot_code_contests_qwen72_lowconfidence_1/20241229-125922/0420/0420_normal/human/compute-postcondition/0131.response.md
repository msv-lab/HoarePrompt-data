Functionality: ** The function reads an integer grid size (n, m) and a grid of n strings, each of length m, containing characters '.' or '#'. It then processes the grid to check if any column contains a set of '#' characters that partially overlaps with any previously seen column's set of '#' characters. If such a partial overlap is found, the function outputs 'NO'. If no such partial overlap exists for any column, the function outputs 'YES'. The function also handles edge cases where columns contain no '#' characters, which are ignored in the comparison. **
