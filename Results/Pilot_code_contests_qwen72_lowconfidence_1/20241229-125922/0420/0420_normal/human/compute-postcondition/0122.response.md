Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is the next element in `all`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `tem` is a set containing the indices `j` (from 0 to `n - 1`) where `grid[j][2]` is '#', `tem` is not empty, `all` is a non-empty list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `inter` is the intersection of `tem` and the new `j`. If `inter` is not empty and not equal to `tem`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
