The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `grid`, `all`, and `ans`. Specifically, `grid` is updated to be a list of `n` strings read from stdin, each processed by the `rstr` function, which strips leading and trailing whitespace. The variable `all` is initialized as an empty list, and `ans` is set to the string 'YES'. The other variables and functions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', read from stdin, `all` is an empty list, `ans` is 'YES', `rstr` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to a string, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, `rint` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, converts it to an integer, and returns the integer, `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to an integer, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin and returns a list of `n` strings, each processed by `rstr`, `rint_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin and converts each line to an integer, returning a list of these integers, `rints_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin, splits each line into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of lists of integers, `pr` is a lambda function that prints the elements of `args` separated by `sep` to `stdout`, `out` is an empty list**
