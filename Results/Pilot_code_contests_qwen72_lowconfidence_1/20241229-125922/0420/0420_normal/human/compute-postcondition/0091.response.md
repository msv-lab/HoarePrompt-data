To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given State Before the Loop:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `j` is the last element in `all` before the append operation if `tem` is non-empty.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1.
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'.
- `all` is a list of sets or indices.
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `i` is 2.
- `tem` is an empty set.
- `ans` is 'YES'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for j in range(n)` will iterate over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the loop will not run at all.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `n` is greater than 0. This is already given as part of the initial state (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), so no adjustment is needed for `n`.
- The variable `j` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, and it will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.

### Final State:
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the initial condition (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
- The variable `j` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, the state after the necessary adjustments is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `tem` is an empty set, and `ans` is 'YES'.**
