The value `0` (the initial value of `j`) is added to the set `tem`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is an empty list, `ans` is 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `tem` is a set containing {0}, and the character at position `[j][i]` in `grid` is '#'**
