The code snippet adds the value of `j` to the set `tem`. Given that `j` is 2, this means 2 will be added to the set `tem`.

- If `grid[2][0]` is '.', then `tem` was initially {1}. After adding 2, `tem` becomes {1, 2}.
- If `grid[2][0]` is '#', then `tem` was initially {0, 1}. After adding 2, `tem` becomes {0, 1, 2}.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is 2, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is an empty list, `ans` is 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `tem` is {1, 2} if `grid[2][0]` is '.', otherwise `tem` is {0, 1, 2} if `grid[2][0]` is '#'**
