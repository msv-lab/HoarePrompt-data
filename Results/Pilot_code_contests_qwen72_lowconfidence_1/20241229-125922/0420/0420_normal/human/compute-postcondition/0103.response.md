To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `j` is `n - 1`
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'
- `tem` is a set containing the indices `j` (from 0 to `n - 1`) where `grid[j][2]` is '#', and `tem` is not empty
- `all` is a list of sets or indices
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations
- `out` is an empty list
- `i` is 2
- `ans` is 'YES'

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in all:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the list `all`.
- For the loop to execute, `all` must contain at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only state that directly affects the execution of the loop is `all`. It must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute at least once.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is `n - 1`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `tem` is a set containing the indices `j` (from 0 to `n - 1`) where `grid[j][2]` is '#', and `tem` is not empty, `all` is a non-empty list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and `ans` is 'YES'**
