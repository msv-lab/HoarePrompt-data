To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `j` is 1.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50.
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'.
- `all` is an empty list.
- `ans` is 'YES'.
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `tem` is {1} if `grid[j][i]` is '.', otherwise `tem` is {0, 1} if `grid[j][i]` is '#'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `n`.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` should be incremented to 2.
- Since `j` is incremented, the value of `tem` will depend on the new value of `grid[j][i]` (i.e., `grid[2][0]`).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is 2, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is an empty list, `ans` is 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `tem` is {1} if `grid[2][0]` is '.', otherwise `tem` is {0, 1} if `grid[2][0]` is '#'**
