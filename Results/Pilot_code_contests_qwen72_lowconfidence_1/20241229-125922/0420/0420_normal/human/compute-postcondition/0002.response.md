The code defines a new lambda function `rint` that reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ n, m â‰¤ 50. The grid is represented by a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters '.' or '#'. `rstr` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to a string, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. `rint` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, converts it to an integer, and returns the integer.**
