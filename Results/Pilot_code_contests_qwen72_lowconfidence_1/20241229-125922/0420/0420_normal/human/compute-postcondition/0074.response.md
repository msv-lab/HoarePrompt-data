The code snippet `ans = 'NO'` assigns the string `'NO'` to the variable `ans`. This changes the value of `ans` from its previous condition, which was dependent on whether `inter` was equal to `tem`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is the next element in `all`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a non-empty list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `tem` is a non-empty set containing the indices of all rows in `grid` where the character at position `i` is `#`, `inter` is the intersection of `tem` and `j`, `ans` is 'NO'.**
