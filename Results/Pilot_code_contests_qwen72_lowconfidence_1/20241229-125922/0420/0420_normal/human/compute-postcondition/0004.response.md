The code snippet introduces a new lambda function `rstr_2d` that reads `n` lines from standard input (`stdin`), each line being processed by the `rstr` function, which strips leading and trailing whitespace. The result is a list of `n` strings, each representing a line read from `stdin`.

Given the initial state, the new function `rstr_2d` is added to the environment, but it does not immediately execute. The existing variables `n`, `m`, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, and `rints` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50. The grid is represented by a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters '.' or '#'. `rstr` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to a string, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. `rint` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, converts it to an integer, and returns the integer. `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to an integer. `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin and returns a list of `n` strings, each processed by `rstr`.**
