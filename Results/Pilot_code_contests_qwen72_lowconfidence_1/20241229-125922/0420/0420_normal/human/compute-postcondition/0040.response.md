The code snippet `inter = tem.intersection(j)` performs an intersection between the set `tem` and the element `j`. Since `j` is described as "the next element in `all`", it implies `j` could be a set, list, or another iterable type that allows intersection operation with a set.

Given:
- `tem` is a set containing at least one index `j` (0 ≤ j < n) where `grid[j][0]` is '#'.
- `j` is the next element in `all`.

Assuming `j` is a set (since the intersection operation is being performed), the intersection will result in a set of elements that are common between `tem` and `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is the next element in `all`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list that must contain at least one element, `ans` is 'NO' if `inter` is not equal to `tem` and `inter` evaluates to a truthy value, otherwise `ans` remains 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `tem` is a set containing at least one index `j` (0 ≤ j < n) where `grid[j][0]` is '#', `inter` is the set of elements common to `tem` and `j`.**
