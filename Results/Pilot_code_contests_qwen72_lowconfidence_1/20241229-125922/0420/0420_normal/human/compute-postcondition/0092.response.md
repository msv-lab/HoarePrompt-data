Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'. The character at position `grid[j][i]` is '#'. `all` is a list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `tem` is an empty set, and `ans` is 'YES'.***
