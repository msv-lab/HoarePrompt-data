The function `rstr` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input (`stdin`), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string. This does not directly affect the values of `n`, `m`, or the grid, which remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50. The grid is represented by a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters '.' or '#'. `rstr` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
