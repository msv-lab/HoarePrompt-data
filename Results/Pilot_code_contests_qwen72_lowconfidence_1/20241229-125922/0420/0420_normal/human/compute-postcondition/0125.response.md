The code `all.append(tem)` adds the set `tem` to the list `all`. This impacts the state of `all` but does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is `n - 1`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `tem` is a set containing the indices `j` (from 0 to `n - 1`) where `grid[j][2]` is '#', `tem` is not empty, `all` is a list of sets or indices and now includes `tem`, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `ans` is 'NO' if there exists a `j` in `all` such that `tem.intersection(j)` is not empty and not equal to `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES'. Additionally, `tem` is in `all`.**
