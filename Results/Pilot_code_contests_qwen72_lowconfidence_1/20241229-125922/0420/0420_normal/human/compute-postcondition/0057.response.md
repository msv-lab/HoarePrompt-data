The code snippet `tem.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `tem`. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 0
- `j` is 1
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'
- `all` is a list of sets or indices
- `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations
- `out` is an empty list
- `i` is 1
- `tem` is {0} if the character at position `i` in the string at index 1 in `grid` is `#`. Otherwise, `tem` remains an empty set

After executing `tem.add(j)`, the set `tem` will include the value of `j`, which is 1. Therefore, the updated state of `tem` will be `{0, 1}` if the character at position `i` in the string at index 1 in `grid` is `#`, or `{1}` if the character at position `i` in the string at index 1 in `grid` is `'.'`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list of sets or indices, `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `tem` is `{0, 1}` if the character at position `i` in the string at index 1 in `grid` is `#`; otherwise, `tem` is `{1}`.**
