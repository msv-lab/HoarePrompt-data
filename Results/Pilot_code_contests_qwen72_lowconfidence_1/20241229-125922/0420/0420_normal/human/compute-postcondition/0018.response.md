The code snippet `tem.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `tem`. Given that `j` is 1, the value 1 will be added to `tem`.

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `j` is 1.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50.
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'.
- `all` is an empty list.
- `ans` is 'YES'.
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `tem` initially contains {0} if `grid[j][i]` is '#'. Otherwise, `tem` remains an empty set.

After executing `tem.add(j)`, the value 1 is added to `tem`.

If `grid[j][i]` is '#':
- `tem` was initially {0}.
- After `tem.add(j)`, `tem` becomes {0, 1}.

If `grid[j][i]` is '.':
- `tem` was initially an empty set {}.
- After `tem.add(j)`, `tem` becomes {1}.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is an empty list, `ans` is 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `tem` is {1} if `grid[j][i]` is '.', otherwise `tem` is {0, 1} if `grid[j][i]` is '#'**.
