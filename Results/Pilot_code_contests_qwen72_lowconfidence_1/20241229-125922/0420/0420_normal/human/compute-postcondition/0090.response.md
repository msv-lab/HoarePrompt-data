The code snippet `tem = set()` initializes or reinitializes `tem` to an empty set. This operation changes the value of `tem` from its previous state (which was a set containing the indices of all rows in `grid` where the character at position `i` is `#`) to an empty set.

Since `tem` is now an empty set, it does not affect the condition for appending to `all` because the condition checks if `tem` is non-empty. Therefore, `all` remains unchanged, and `ans` also remains 'YES' as the condition for changing `ans` to 'NO' involves a non-empty `tem`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is the last element in `all` before the append operation if `tem` is non-empty, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `tem` is an empty set, and `ans` is 'YES'.**
