The code snippet `tem = set()` initializes `tem` as an empty set, overriding its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is the last element in `all` or `n-1` if `all` is empty, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list of sets or indices, `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `tem` is an empty set, `m` must be greater than 1.**
