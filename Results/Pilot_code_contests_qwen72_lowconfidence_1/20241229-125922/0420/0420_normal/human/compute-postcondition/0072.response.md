To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1.
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'.
- `all` is a non-empty list of sets or indices.
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.
- `tem` is a non-empty set containing the indices of all rows in `grid` where the character at position `i` is `#`.
- `inter` is the intersection of `tem` and `{n-1}`.
- If `inter` is truthy (i.e., not empty), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `inter` is not equal to `tem`, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in all:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the list `all`.
2. **State Variables**:
   - `j` is the current element from `all` being processed in the loop.
   - `all` is a non-empty list of sets or indices.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`j`**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the next element in the list `all`.
- **`all`**: The list `all` remains unchanged, but the next element will be used for `j`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **`j`**: Since `j` is the current element from `all`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be the next element in `all`.
2. **`all`**: The list `all` does not change; it just moves to the next element.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is the next element in `all`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a non-empty list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `tem` is a non-empty set containing the indices of all rows in `grid` where the character at position `i` is `#`, `inter` is the intersection of `tem` and `{n-1}`, `ans` is 'YES' if `inter` is equal to `tem`, otherwise `ans` is 'NO'.**
