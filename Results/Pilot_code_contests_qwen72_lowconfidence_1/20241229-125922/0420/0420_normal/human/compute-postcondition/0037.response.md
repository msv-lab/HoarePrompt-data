The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the most internal loop or if statement. Since there's no loop or conditional structure mentioned in the initial state that explicitly contains this `break` statement, we assume the `break` is breaking out of such a structure.

The values of the variables do not change due to the `break` statement itself. However, the control flow changes, meaning the program exits the current loop or conditional block.

Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions, with the addition that the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is the next element in `all`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list that must contain at least one element, `ans` is 'NO' if `inter` is not equal to `tem` and `inter` evaluates to a truthy value, otherwise `ans` remains 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `tem` is a set containing at least one index `j` (0 ≤ j < n) where `grid[j][0]` is '#', `inter` is not properly initialized due to a `TypeError`, and if `inter` evaluates to a truthy value, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
