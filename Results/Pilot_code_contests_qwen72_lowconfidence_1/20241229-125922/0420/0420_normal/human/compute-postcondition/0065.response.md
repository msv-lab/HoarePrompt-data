The code snippet `inter = tem.intersection(j)` computes the intersection between the set `tem` and the set `j`. The result of this intersection is stored in the new variable `inter`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `j` is `n-1`
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'
- `all` is a non-empty list of sets or indices
- `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations
- `out` is an empty list
- `i` is 1
- `tem` is a non-empty set containing the indices of all rows in `grid` where the character at position `i` is `#`

After executing the code snippet:
- `inter` is assigned the result of the intersection between `tem` and `j`.

Since `j` is a single integer (`n-1`), it is treated as a set containing a single element `{n-1}` when performing the intersection. Therefore, `inter` will contain the elements that are both in `tem` and `{n-1}`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a non-empty list of sets or indices, `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `tem` is a non-empty set containing the indices of all rows in `grid` where the character at position `i` is `#`, `inter` is the intersection of `tem` and `{n-1}`**
