To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `j` is the last element in `all` or `n-1` if `all` is empty.
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 50\).
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'.
- `all` is a list of sets or indices.
- If `tem` is not empty and not in `all`, `all` now includes `tem`, and `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.
- If `tem` is empty or already in `all`, the state of `all` and `ans` remains unchanged.
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `tem` is a set containing at least one index `j` (0 ≤ j < n) where `grid[j][0]` is '#' if `tem` was not empty, otherwise `tem` remains an empty set.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 50\).

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` should be 1.
   - The loop condition `i < m` must still hold true, meaning `m` must be greater than 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is the last element in `all` or `n-1` if `all` is empty, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list of sets or indices, `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `tem` is a set containing at least one index `j` (0 ≤ j < n) where `grid[j][0]` is '#' if `tem` was not empty, otherwise `tem` remains an empty set, `m` must be greater than 1.**
