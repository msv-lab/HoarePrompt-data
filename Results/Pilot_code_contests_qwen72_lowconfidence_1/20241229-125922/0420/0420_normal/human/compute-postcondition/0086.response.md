The code `all.append(tem)` adds the set `tem` to the list `all`.

- `all` was initially a non-empty list of sets or indices.
- `tem` is a non-empty set containing the indices of all rows in `grid` where the character at position `i` (which is 1) is `#`.
- After appending `tem` to `all`, `all` now includes this new set.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is the last element in `all` before the append operation, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a non-empty list of sets or indices with `tem` appended to it, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `tem` is a non-empty set containing the indices of all rows in `grid` where the character at position `i` is `#`, and `ans` remains 'YES' unless there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value, in which case `ans` is 'NO'.**
