Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is `n - 1`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `tem` is a set containing the indices `j` (from 0 to `n - 1`) where `grid[j][2]` is '#'. `all` is a list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 2. If `tem` is not empty and there exists a `j` in `all` such that `tem.intersection(j)` is not empty and not equal to `tem`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `tem` is not in `all`, `tem` is added to `all` and `ans` remains 'YES'. If `tem` is empty, `ans` remains 'YES'.***
