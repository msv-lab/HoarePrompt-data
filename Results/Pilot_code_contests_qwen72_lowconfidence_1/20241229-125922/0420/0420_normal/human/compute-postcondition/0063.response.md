Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list of sets or indices, `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `tem` is a non-empty set containing the indices of all rows in `grid` where the character at position `i` is `#`.**
