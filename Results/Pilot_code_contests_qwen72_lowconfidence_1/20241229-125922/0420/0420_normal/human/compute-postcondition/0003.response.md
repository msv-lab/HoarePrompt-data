The `rints` lambda function reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to an integer. This function does not affect the existing variables `n`, `m`, `rstr`, `rstrs`, or `rint`. However, it introduces a new function `rints` that can be used to read a list of integers from the standard input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50. The grid is represented by a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters '.' or '#'. `rstr` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to a string, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. `rint` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, converts it to an integer, and returns the integer. `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to an integer.**
