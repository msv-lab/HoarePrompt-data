To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(n)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1.
   - `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'.
   - If `grid[j][i]` is '#', `tem` is {1}. Otherwise, `tem` remains an empty set.
   - `all` is a list of sets or indices.
   - `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations.
   - `out` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ans` is 'YES'.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, the value of `j` needs to be updated.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

Given the current state where `j` is 1, the next value of `j` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

**Adjusted State**:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `j` is 2.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1.
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'.
- If `grid[j][i]` is '#', `tem` is {1}. Otherwise, `tem` remains an empty set.
- `all` is a list of sets or indices.
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `i` is 2.
- `ans` is 'YES'.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is 2, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'. If `grid[j][i]` is '#', `tem` is {1}. Otherwise, `tem` remains an empty set. `all` is a list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `ans` is 'YES', and `n` must be greater than 2.**
