To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `j` is the next element in `all`.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50.
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'.
- `all` is a list that must contain at least one element.
- `ans` is 'NO' if `inter` is not equal to `tem` and `inter` evaluates to a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `tem` is a set containing at least one index `j` (0 ≤ j < n) where `grid[j][0]` is '#'.
- If `inter` evaluates to a truthy value, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` is set to 'NO' if `inter` is not equal to `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in all:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the list `all`.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - **`j`**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be the next element in the list `all`.
   - **`all`**: The list `all` should still contain at least one element for the loop to execute again.
   - **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `m`, `grid`, `ans`, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr`, `out`, `i`, `tem`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is omitted.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is the next element in `all`.
- `all` must contain at least one element.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is the next element in `all`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list that must contain at least one element, `ans` is 'NO' if `inter` is not equal to `tem` and `inter` evaluates to a truthy value, otherwise `ans` remains 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `tem` is a set containing at least one index `j` (0 ≤ j < n) where `grid[j][0]` is '#'.**
