Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list that must contain at least one element, `ans` is 'NO' if `inter` is not equal to `tem` and `inter` evaluates to a truthy value, otherwise `ans` remains 'YES'. `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `tem` is a set containing at least one index `j` (0 ≤ j < n) where `grid[j][0]` is '#', `inter` is not properly initialized due to a TypeError, and if `inter` evaluates to a truthy value, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
