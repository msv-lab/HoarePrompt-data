Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is the last element in `all` or `n-1` if `all` is empty, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list of sets or indices, `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value, otherwise `ans` remains 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `tem` is a set containing at least one index `j` (0 ≤ j < n) where `grid[j][0]` is '#'. Additionally, `tem` is not in `all`.***
