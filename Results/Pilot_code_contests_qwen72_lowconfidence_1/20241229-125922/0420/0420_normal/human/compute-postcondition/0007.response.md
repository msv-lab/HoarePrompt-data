The provided code defines a lambda function `pr` which takes two arguments: `args` and `sep`. This function writes to `stdout` the result of joining the string representations of the elements in `args` using `sep` as a separator, followed by a newline character.

- `args`: A list or iterable of items to be printed.
- `sep`: A string used to separate the items in `args`.

This function does not modify any existing variables or introduce new variables, except for defining `pr` itself. The impact of this code is solely the introduction of the `pr` function into the environment.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the `pr` function being defined.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50, the grid is a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters '.' or '#', `rstr` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to a string, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, `rint` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, converts it to an integer, and returns the integer, `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to an integer, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin and returns a list of `n` strings, each processed by `rstr`, `rint_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin and converts each line to an integer, returning a list of these integers, `rints_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin, splits each line into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of lists of integers, `pr` is a lambda function that prints the elements of `args` separated by `sep` to `stdout`**.
