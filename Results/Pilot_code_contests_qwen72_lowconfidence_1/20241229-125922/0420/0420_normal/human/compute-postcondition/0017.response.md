To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `j` is 0.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50.
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'.
- `all` is an empty list.
- `ans` is 'YES'.
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `tem` is a set containing {0} if `grid[j][i]` is '#'. Otherwise, `tem` remains an empty set.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
- The loop variable `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

### Current State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1.
- For the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `j` is now 1).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is an empty list, `ans` is 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `tem` is a set containing {0} if `grid[j][i]` is '#'. Otherwise, `tem` remains an empty set.**
