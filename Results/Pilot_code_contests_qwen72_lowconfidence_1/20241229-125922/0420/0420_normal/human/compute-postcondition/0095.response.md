To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `j` is 0.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1.
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'.
- If `grid[j][i]` is '#', `tem` is {0}. Otherwise, `tem` remains an empty set.
- `all` is a list of sets or indices.
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `i` is 2.
- `ans` is 'YES'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.

### Adjustments Needed:
- At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
- For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than `n`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Increment `j`**: Since the loop increments `j` by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be 1.
2. **Check Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

### Updated State:
- `j` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'. If `grid[j][i]` is '#', `tem` is {0}. Otherwise, `tem` remains an empty set. `all` is a list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and `ans` is 'YES'.**
