To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and initial conditions:

1. The loop iterates over the range of `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'
- `all` is an empty list
- `ans` is 'YES'
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations
- `out` is an empty list
- `i` is 0
- `tem` is an empty set

The key variable affecting the loop's execution is `n`. Since the loop is defined as `for j in range(n)`, the loop will execute if and only if `n` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is already constrained to be at least 1, no adjustment to `n` is necessary.

However, we need to initialize `j` to 0 for the first iteration of the loop. Additionally, since the loop body is omitted, we assume no other state variables need to be modified for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the state should be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is an empty list, `ans` is 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `tem` is an empty set**
