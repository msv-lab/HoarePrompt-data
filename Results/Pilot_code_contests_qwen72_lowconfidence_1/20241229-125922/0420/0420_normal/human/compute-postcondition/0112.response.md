The line of code `inter = tem.intersection(j)` impacts the variable `inter` by setting it to the intersection of the set `tem` and the set or index `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `j` is the next element in `all`
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'
- `tem` is a set containing the indices `j` (from 0 to `n - 1`) where `grid[j][2]` is '#', and `tem` is not empty
- `all` is a non-empty list of sets or indices
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations
- `out` is an empty list
- `i` is 2
- `inter` is a set containing the next `j` if the next `j` is in `tem`
- If `inter` is not empty and `inter` is not equal to `tem`, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'

The code `inter = tem.intersection(j)` changes the value of `inter` to the intersection of `tem` and `j`. Since `j` is the next element in `all`, which could be a set or an index, the intersection will be calculated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is the next element in `all`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `tem` is a set containing the indices `j` (from 0 to `n - 1`) where `grid[j][2]` is '#', `tem` is not empty, `all` is a non-empty list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `inter` is the intersection of `tem` and `j`, if `inter` is not empty and `inter` is not equal to `tem`, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
