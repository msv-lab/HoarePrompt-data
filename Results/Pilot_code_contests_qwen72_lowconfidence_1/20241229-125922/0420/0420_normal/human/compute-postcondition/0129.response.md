The `print(ans)` statement outputs the value of `ans`. Based on the initial state, `ans` can be either 'YES' or 'NO'. Since no changes are made to the variables in the given code snippet, all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list of sets, each set containing the indices of rows where the character at a specific column is '#', `ans` is 'YES' or 'NO', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list.**
