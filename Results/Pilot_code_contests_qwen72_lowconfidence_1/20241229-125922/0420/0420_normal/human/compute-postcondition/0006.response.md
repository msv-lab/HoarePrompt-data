The lambda function `rints_2d` is defined to read `n` lines from stdin, split each line into parts based on spaces, convert each part to an integer, and return a list of lists, where each inner list contains the integers from one line.

- `n` and `m` remain integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50.
- The grid remains a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'.
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, and `rint_2d` retain their original definitions.
- A new lambda function `rints_2d` is defined.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50, the grid is a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters '.' or '#', `rstr` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to a string, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, `rint` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, converts it to an integer, and returns the integer, `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to an integer, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin and returns a list of `n` strings, each processed by `rstr`, `rint_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin and converts each line to an integer, returning a list of these integers, `rints_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin, splits each line into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of lists of integers.**
