The code defines a lambda function `rstrs` which reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), splits it into parts based on spaces, and then converts each part to a string, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.

- `rstrs` is now defined as a lambda function that performs the described operation.
- The initial state variables `n`, `m`, and the grid (a list of strings) are not altered by this code snippet.
- The function `rstr` mentioned in the initial state is not used in this snippet, and its definition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50. The grid is represented by a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters '.' or '#'. `rstr` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to a string, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.**
