To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `j` is the last element in `all` or `n-1` if `all` is empty
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'
- `all` is a list of sets or indices
- `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations
- `out` is an empty list
- `i` is 1
- `tem` is an empty set
- `m` must be greater than 1

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for j in range(n):` will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `j` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
- The other variables (`m`, `grid`, `all`, `ans`, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr`, `out`, `i`, `tem`) do not need to be adjusted specifically for the loop to execute, but they must be in a valid state as per their initial conditions.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list of sets or indices, `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `tem` is an empty set, `m` must be greater than 1**
