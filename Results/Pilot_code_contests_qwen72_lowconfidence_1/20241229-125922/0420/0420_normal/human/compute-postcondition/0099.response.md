The code snippet `tem.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `tem`. Given that `j` is 2, the set `tem` will now contain the element 2. The rest of the variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is 2, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'. If `grid[j][i]` is '#', `tem` is {1, 2}. Otherwise, `tem` is {2}. `all` is a list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `ans` is 'YES', and `n` must be greater than 2.**
