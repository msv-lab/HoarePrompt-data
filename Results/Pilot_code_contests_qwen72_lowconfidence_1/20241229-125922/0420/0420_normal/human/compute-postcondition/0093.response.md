The code snippet `tem.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `tem`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `j` is 0.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1.
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'. The character at position `grid[j][i]` is '#'.
- `all` is a list of sets or indices.
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `i` is 2.
- `tem` is an empty set.
- `ans` is 'YES'.

After executing the code snippet `tem.add(j)`, the value 0 (the current value of `j`) is added to the set `tem`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'. The character at position `grid[j][i]` is '#', `all` is a list of sets or indices, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `tem` is {0}, `ans` is 'YES'.**
