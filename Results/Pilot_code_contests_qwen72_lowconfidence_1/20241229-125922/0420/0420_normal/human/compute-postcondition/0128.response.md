Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list of sets, each set containing the indices of rows where the character at a specific column is '#'. If there exists any column `i` where the set of row indices `tem` intersects with any set in `all` but is not equal to that set, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'. If `tem` is empty for any column, it is not added to `all`. `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list.**
