The `rint_2d` lambda function is defined to read `n` lines from stdin and convert each line to an integer, returning a list of these integers. This definition does not execute the function; it only defines it. Therefore, no actual reading or conversion occurs, and no new variables are created or modified.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50. The grid is represented by a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters '.' or '#'. `rstr` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to a string, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. `rint` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, converts it to an integer, and returns the integer. `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part to an integer. `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin and returns a list of `n` strings, each processed by `rstr`. `rint_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from stdin and converts each line to an integer, returning a list of these integers.**
