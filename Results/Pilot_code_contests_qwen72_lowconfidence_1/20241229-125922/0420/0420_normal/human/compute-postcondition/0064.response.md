To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1.
- `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#'.
- `all` is a list of sets or indices.
- `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.
- `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.
- `tem` is a non-empty set containing the indices of all rows in `grid` where the character at position `i` is `#`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in all:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `all` is not an empty list.
2. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - `all` must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute.
   - `j` is initialized to `n-1`, but this is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition.
   - `i` is 1, which is used to determine `tem`.
   - `tem` is a non-empty set, which means there must be at least one row in `grid` where the character at position `i` (which is 1) is `#`.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `all` is not empty. Additionally, `tem` must be a non-empty set, which implies that there must be at least one row in `grid` where the character at position 1 is `#`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `j` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a non-empty list of sets or indices, `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `tem` is a non-empty set containing the indices of all rows in `grid` where the character at position `i` is `#`.**
