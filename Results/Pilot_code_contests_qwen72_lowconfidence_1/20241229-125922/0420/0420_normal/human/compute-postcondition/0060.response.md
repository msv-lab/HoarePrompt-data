The value of `j` is 2, and `tem` is `{0, 1}` if the character at position `i` in the string at index 1 in `grid` is `#`; otherwise, `tem` is `{1}`. The line `tem.add(j)` adds the value of `j` (which is 2) to the set `tem`.

Therefore, if the character at position `i` in the string at index 1 in `grid` is `#`, `tem` was `{0, 1}` and becomes `{0, 1, 2}`. Otherwise, if the character is `.`, `tem` was `{1}` and becomes `{1, 2}`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '.' or '#', `all` is a list of sets or indices, `ans` is 'NO' if there exists any `j` in `all` such that the intersection of `j` and `tem` is not equal to `tem` and is a truthy value; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES', `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr` are functions/lambda functions for input/output operations, `out` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `tem` is `{0, 1, 2}` if the character at position `i` in the string at index 1 in `grid` is `#`; otherwise, `tem` is `{1, 2}`.**
