`pair` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which is an input string. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `string` is the input string, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13, `pairs_num` must be greater than 1, `pairs` is a list containing the string `pair`, `i` is 1, `pair` is an input string.
