According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `pairs_num`. If `i` is less than `pairs_num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `pairs_num` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `pairs_num` must be greater than 2.

State: **`string` is the input string, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13, `pairs_num` must be greater than 2, `pairs` is a list containing the strings `pair` and `pair`, `i` is 2, `pair` is an input string**
