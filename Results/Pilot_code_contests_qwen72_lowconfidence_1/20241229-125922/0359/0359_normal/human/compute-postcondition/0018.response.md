The method `min_deletions()` of the `Parser` object is called, which computes the minimum number of deletions required to make the `string` valid according to the `pairs` defined. The result of this computation is printed.

The variables `string`, `s`, `k`, `pairs_num`, `pairs`, and `i` are not modified by this code snippet. The state of the `parser` object might change internally as a result of the `min_deletions()` method being called, but since the internal state of the `parser` object is not specified, we cannot determine the exact changes. However, the output of `min_deletions()` is printed, which represents the minimum number of deletions needed.

Output State: **`string` is the input string, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13, `pairs_num` is the original value of `pairs_num`, `pairs` is a list containing `pairs_num` unique pairs of different lowercase Latin letters, each letter appears in at most one forbidden pair, `i` is `pairs_num`, `parser` is a Parser object initialized with `string` and `pairs`. The minimum number of deletions required to make the string valid has been printed.**
