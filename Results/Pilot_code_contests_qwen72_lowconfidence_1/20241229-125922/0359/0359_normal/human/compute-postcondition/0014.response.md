The code appends the string `pair` to the list `pairs`. The initial state indicates that `pairs` contains two elements, both of which are the string `pair`. After appending another `pair`, the list `pairs` will contain three elements, all of which are the string `pair`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `string` is the input string, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13, `pairs_num` must be greater than 2, `pairs` is a list containing the strings `pair`, `pair`, and `pair`, `i` is 2, `pair` is an input string from `raw_input()`.
Output State: **`string` is the input string, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13, `pairs_num` must be greater than 2, `pairs` is a list containing the strings `pair`, `pair`, and `pair`, `i` is 2, `pair` is an input string from `raw_input()`**
