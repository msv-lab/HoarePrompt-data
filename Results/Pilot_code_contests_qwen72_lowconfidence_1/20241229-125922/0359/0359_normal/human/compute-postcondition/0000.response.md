The code snippet assigns the user's input to the variable `string`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105, and `k` is an integer within the range 0 to 13, representing the number of forbidden pairs. The impact of the code is that the variable `string` now holds the value provided by the user, which is expected to be a string.

Output State: **`string` is the input string, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13; each of the k lines contains a unique pair of different lowercase Latin letters representing forbidden pairs, and each letter appears in at most one forbidden pair.**
