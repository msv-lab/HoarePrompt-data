According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `pairs_num`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `pairs_num`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `pairs_num` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `pairs_num`. Since `i` is 1, `pairs_num` must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`string` is the input string, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13, `pairs_num` must be greater than 1, `pairs` is a list containing the string `pair`, `i` is 1, `pair` is an input string**
