The value of `pairs_num` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it now holds the user-provided input. The input is expected to be a string representation of the number of forbidden pairs. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`string` is the input string, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13; each of the k lines contains a unique pair of different lowercase Latin letters representing forbidden pairs, and each letter appears in at most one forbidden pair; `pairs_num` is the input string representing the number of forbidden pairs.**
