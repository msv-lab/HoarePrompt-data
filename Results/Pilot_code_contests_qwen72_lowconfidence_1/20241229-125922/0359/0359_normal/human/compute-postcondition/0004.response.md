To determine if the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the condition `i < pairs_num` is true. Let's break down the given state and the condition:

- `string` is the input string (this is not directly relevant to the loop condition).
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105 (this is also not directly relevant to the loop condition).
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13, representing the number of forbidden pairs (this is not directly relevant to the loop condition but is related to `pairs_num`).
- `pairs_num` is the input string representing the number of forbidden pairs (this is crucial for the loop condition).
- `pairs` is an empty list (this is not directly relevant to the loop condition).
- `i` is 0 (this is crucial for the loop condition).

The loop condition is `i < pairs_num`. For the loop to execute at least once, `pairs_num` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is 0, the condition `0 < pairs_num` must be true.

Given that `pairs_num` is the input string representing the number of forbidden pairs, it must be a positive integer for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `pairs_num` is greater than 0.

State: **`string` is the input string, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13, `pairs_num` must be greater than 0, `pairs` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
