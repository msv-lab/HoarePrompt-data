The code `pairs.append(pair)` adds the input string `pair` to the list `pairs`. The `pairs` list was initially empty, and now it contains one element, which is the string `pair`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`string` is the input string, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13, `pairs_num` must be greater than 0, `pairs` is a list containing the string `pair`, `i` is 0, `pair` is an input string**
