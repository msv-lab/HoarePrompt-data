The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `k`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105. `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13. Each of the `k` lines contains a unique pair of different lowercase Latin letters representing forbidden pairs, and each letter appears in at most one forbidden pair.

The function returns a modified version of the string `s` where no forbidden pairs (as defined by the `k` pairs) are present. The exact nature of the modification (e.g., removing characters, replacing characters) is not specified, but the result is a string that does not contain any of the forbidden pairs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and an integer `k`, and returns a modified version of `s` where no forbidden pairs (as defined by `k` unique pairs) are present.**
