The function `func_1` reads an input string `s` and an integer `k`, followed by `k` pairs of forbidden characters. It then computes and prints the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of the forbidden pairs from the string `s`. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result. The final state of the program includes the original string `s`, the integer `k`, the list of forbidden pairs, and the printed result representing the minimum deletions needed. Edge cases include scenarios where `k` is 0 (no forbidden pairs), `s` contains no forbidden pairs, or `s` contains multiple instances of the same forbidden pair. The function assumes that each letter appears in at most one forbidden pair, and it handles the input and computation accordingly.
