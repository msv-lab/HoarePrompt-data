You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sergey attends lessons of the N-ish language. Each lesson he receives a hometask. This time the task is to translate some sentence to the N-ish language. Sentences of the N-ish language can be represented as strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters without spaces or punctuation marks.

Sergey totally forgot about the task until half an hour before the next lesson and hastily scribbled something down. But then he recollected that in the last lesson he learned the grammar of N-ish. The spelling rules state that N-ish contains some "forbidden" pairs of letters: such letters can never occur in a sentence next to each other. Also, the order of the letters doesn't matter (for example, if the pair of letters "ab" is forbidden, then any occurrences of substrings "ab" and "ba" are also forbidden). Also, each pair has different letters and each letter occurs in no more than one forbidden pair.

Now Sergey wants to correct his sentence so that it doesn't contain any "forbidden" pairs of letters that stand next to each other. However, he is running out of time, so he decided to simply cross out some letters from the sentence. What smallest number of letters will he have to cross out? When a letter is crossed out, it is "removed" so that the letters to its left and right (if they existed), become neighboring. For example, if we cross out the first letter from the string "aba", we get the string "ba", and if we cross out the second letter, we get "aa".

Input

The first line contains a non-empty string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters — that's the initial sentence in N-ish, written by Sergey. The length of string s doesn't exceed 105.

The next line contains integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 13) — the number of forbidden pairs of letters.

Next k lines contain descriptions of forbidden pairs of letters. Each line contains exactly two different lowercase Latin letters without separators that represent the forbidden pairs. It is guaranteed that each letter is included in no more than one pair.

Output

Print the single number — the smallest number of letters that need to be removed to get a string without any forbidden pairs of neighboring letters. Please note that the answer always exists as it is always possible to remove all letters.

Examples

Input

ababa
1
ab


Output

2


Input

codeforces
2
do
cs


Output

1

Note

In the first sample you should remove two letters b.

In the second sample you should remove the second or the third letter. The second restriction doesn't influence the solution.

```
Output hints: The function `func_1` reads an input string `s` and an integer `k`, followed by `k` pairs of forbidden characters. It then computes and prints the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of the forbidden pairs from the string `s`. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result. The final state of the program includes the original string `s`, the integer `k`, the list of forbidden pairs, and the printed result representing the minimum deletions needed. Edge cases include scenarios where `k` is 0 (no forbidden pairs), `s` contains no forbidden pairs, or `s` contains multiple instances of the same forbidden pair. The function assumes that each letter appears in at most one forbidden pair, and it handles the input and computation accordingly.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
