Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case as per the problem description:

1. **Handling of Forbidden Pairs**: The code processes each forbidden pair independently, which can lead to incorrect results when multiple forbidden pairs interact. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   abac
   2
   ab
   ac
   ```
   The correct answer should be 2 (remove both 'a' characters), but the code might only remove one 'a' because it processes the pairs one at a time.

2. **String Manipulation**: The code modifies the string `self.string` by slicing and concatenating it, which can be inefficient and may lead to incorrect results. For example, if the string is modified in a way that introduces new forbidden pairs, the algorithm might miss them.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases well. For instance, if the input string is very long and contains many forbidden pairs, the repeated string slicing and concatenation can lead to performance issues and potential logical errors.

4. **Incorrect Logic for Overlapping Pairs**: The logic for determining the number of deletions is flawed. Specifically, the code uses a sliding window approach to count occurrences of each character in the forbidden pair, but it does not correctly handle overlapping pairs or multiple occurrences of the same pair.

To ensure correctness, the program should:
- Process all forbidden pairs simultaneously.
- Use a more efficient method to count and remove forbidden pairs.
- Handle edge cases and ensure that the string is processed correctly without introducing new forbidden pairs.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
