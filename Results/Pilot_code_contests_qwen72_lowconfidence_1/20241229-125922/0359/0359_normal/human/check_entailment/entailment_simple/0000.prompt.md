You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Sergey attends lessons of the N-ish language. Each lesson he receives a hometask. This time the task is to translate some sentence to the N-ish language. Sentences of the N-ish language can be represented as strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters without spaces or punctuation marks.

Sergey totally forgot about the task until half an hour before the next lesson and hastily scribbled something down. But then he recollected that in the last lesson he learned the grammar of N-ish. The spelling rules state that N-ish contains some "forbidden" pairs of letters: such letters can never occur in a sentence next to each other. Also, the order of the letters doesn't matter (for example, if the pair of letters "ab" is forbidden, then any occurrences of substrings "ab" and "ba" are also forbidden). Also, each pair has different letters and each letter occurs in no more than one forbidden pair.

Now Sergey wants to correct his sentence so that it doesn't contain any "forbidden" pairs of letters that stand next to each other. However, he is running out of time, so he decided to simply cross out some letters from the sentence. What smallest number of letters will he have to cross out? When a letter is crossed out, it is "removed" so that the letters to its left and right (if they existed), become neighboring. For example, if we cross out the first letter from the string "aba", we get the string "ba", and if we cross out the second letter, we get "aa".

Input

The first line contains a non-empty string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters — that's the initial sentence in N-ish, written by Sergey. The length of string s doesn't exceed 105.

The next line contains integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 13) — the number of forbidden pairs of letters.

Next k lines contain descriptions of forbidden pairs of letters. Each line contains exactly two different lowercase Latin letters without separators that represent the forbidden pairs. It is guaranteed that each letter is included in no more than one pair.

Output

Print the single number — the smallest number of letters that need to be removed to get a string without any forbidden pairs of neighboring letters. Please note that the answer always exists as it is always possible to remove all letters.

Examples

Input

ababa
1
ab


Output

2


Input

codeforces
2
do
cs


Output

1

Note

In the first sample you should remove two letters b.

In the second sample you should remove the second or the third letter. The second restriction doesn't influence the solution.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
