### Analysis of the Program

#### Problem Description Recap
- **Input**: A string `s` and a list of forbidden pairs of characters.
- **Task**: Remove the minimum number of characters from `s` such that no forbidden pairs of characters appear consecutively in the resulting string.

#### Program Overview
The program defines a class `Parser` with a method `min_deletions` to calculate the minimum number of deletions required. The main function `func_1` reads the input and uses the `Parser` class to solve the problem.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Class Definition and Initialization**
   ```python
   class Parser(object):

       def __init__(self, string, pairs):
           self.string = string
           self.str_len = len(string)
           self.pairs = pairs
   ```
   - The `Parser` class is initialized with the input string and the list of forbidden pairs.
   - `self.string` stores the input string.
   - `self.str_len` stores the length of the input string.
   - `self.pairs` stores the list of forbidden pairs.

2. **Main Deletion Logic**
   ```python
   def min_deletions(self):
       deletions = 0
       start = -1
       for pair in self.pairs:
           a = pair[0]
           b = pair[1]
           a_count = b_count = 0
           i = 0
           start = -1
           stop = -1
           while i < self.str_len:
               if a == self.string[i]:
                   a_count += 1
                   if start == -1:
                       start = i
               elif b == self.string[i]:
                   b_count += 1
                   if start == -1:
                       start = i
               elif start != -1:
                   stop = i
                   if stop != start:
                       if a_count > b_count:
                           subs = a * a_count
                           deletions += b_count
                           i = start + a_count
                           self.str_len -= b_count
                       else:
                           subs = b * b_count
                           deletions += a_count
                           i = start + b_count
                           self.str_len -= a_count
                       a_count = b_count = 0
                       self.string = self.string[:start] + subs + self.string[stop:]
                   start = -1
               i += 1
       if start != -1 and stop == -1:
           if a_count > b_count:
               deletions += b_count
           else:
               deletions += a_count
       return deletions
   ```
   - The `min_deletions` method iterates over each forbidden pair.
   - For each pair, it counts the occurrences of the two characters (`a` and `b`) in the string.
   - It keeps track of the start and stop indices of the segment containing these characters.
   - If a segment is found, it calculates the number of deletions needed to remove the smaller count of the two characters and updates the string accordingly.
   - Finally, it handles the case where the segment extends to the end of the string.

3. **Main Function**
   ```python
   def func_1():
       string = raw_input()
       pairs_num = input()
       pairs = []
       i = 0
       while i < pairs_num:
           pair = raw_input()
           pairs.append(pair)
           i += 1
       parser = Parser(string, pairs)
       print(parser.min_deletions())
   ```
   - The `func_1` function reads the input string and the number of forbidden pairs.
   - It then reads each forbidden pair and appends it to the `pairs` list.
   - It creates an instance of the `Parser` class and calls the `min_deletions` method to get the result.

### Correctness Evaluation

#### Positive Aspects
- The program correctly initializes the `Parser` class with the input string and forbidden pairs.
- It iterates over each forbidden pair and counts the occurrences of the characters.
- It calculates the minimum number of deletions required to remove forbidden pairs and updates the string accordingly.
- The program handles edge cases where the segment extends to the end of the string.

#### Potential Issues
- **String Modification Efficiency**: The program modifies the string using slicing and concatenation, which can be inefficient for large strings. However, this is not explicitly stated as a requirement in the problem description, so it is not a correctness issue.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where the input string is very short or where there are no forbidden pairs, but these cases are implicitly handled by the logic.

### Conclusion
The program meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of deletions needed to remove forbidden pairs from the input string.

**Correctness: True**
