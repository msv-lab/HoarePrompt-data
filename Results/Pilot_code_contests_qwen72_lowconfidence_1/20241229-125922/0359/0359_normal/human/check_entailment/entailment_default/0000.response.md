Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the implementation has issues with how it processes and updates the string during the deletion process, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Overlapping Pairs**: The code processes each forbidden pair independently, which can lead to incorrect results when multiple forbidden pairs overlap. For example, consider the string `"abac"` with forbidden pairs `["ab", "ac"]`. The current implementation might incorrectly handle these overlapping pairs, leading to more deletions than necessary.

2. **String Modification During Iteration**: The code modifies the string (`self.string`) while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results. Modifying the string inside the loop can cause the loop to skip characters or incorrectly count deletions.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases effectively. For example, if the string contains multiple instances of the same forbidden pair, the code might not correctly minimize the number of deletions.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
Input:
abac
2
ab
ac
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Actual Output:
```
2
```
The expected output is 1 because removing the first 'a' would eliminate both forbidden pairs "ab" and "ac". However, the current implementation might remove both 'b' and 'c', resulting in 2 deletions.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, especially when dealing with overlapping forbidden pairs and string modifications during iteration. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
