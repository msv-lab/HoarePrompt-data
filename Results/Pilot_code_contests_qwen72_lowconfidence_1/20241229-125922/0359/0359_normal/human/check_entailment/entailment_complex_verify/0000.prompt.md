You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sergey attends lessons of the N-ish language. Each lesson he receives a hometask. This time the task is to translate some sentence to the N-ish language. Sentences of the N-ish language can be represented as strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters without spaces or punctuation marks.

Sergey totally forgot about the task until half an hour before the next lesson and hastily scribbled something down. But then he recollected that in the last lesson he learned the grammar of N-ish. The spelling rules state that N-ish contains some "forbidden" pairs of letters: such letters can never occur in a sentence next to each other. Also, the order of the letters doesn't matter (for example, if the pair of letters "ab" is forbidden, then any occurrences of substrings "ab" and "ba" are also forbidden). Also, each pair has different letters and each letter occurs in no more than one forbidden pair.

Now Sergey wants to correct his sentence so that it doesn't contain any "forbidden" pairs of letters that stand next to each other. However, he is running out of time, so he decided to simply cross out some letters from the sentence. What smallest number of letters will he have to cross out? When a letter is crossed out, it is "removed" so that the letters to its left and right (if they existed), become neighboring. For example, if we cross out the first letter from the string "aba", we get the string "ba", and if we cross out the second letter, we get "aa".

Input

The first line contains a non-empty string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters — that's the initial sentence in N-ish, written by Sergey. The length of string s doesn't exceed 105.

The next line contains integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 13) — the number of forbidden pairs of letters.

Next k lines contain descriptions of forbidden pairs of letters. Each line contains exactly two different lowercase Latin letters without separators that represent the forbidden pairs. It is guaranteed that each letter is included in no more than one pair.

Output

Print the single number — the smallest number of letters that need to be removed to get a string without any forbidden pairs of neighboring letters. Please note that the answer always exists as it is always possible to remove all letters.

Examples

Input

ababa
1
ab


Output

2


Input

codeforces
2
do
cs


Output

1

Note

In the first sample you should remove two letters b.

In the second sample you should remove the second or the third letter. The second restriction doesn't influence the solution.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where a forbidden pair appears multiple times in the string, and the deletion process might incorrectly skip over some occurrences. Specifically, the logic for updating the string and indices can lead to incorrect results. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect String Update**: The program updates the string using slicing and concatenation, which can lead to incorrect indices and missed updates. For example, when a segment is replaced, the subsequent indices might not be correctly adjusted.

2. **Multiple Occurrences Handling**: The program may not correctly handle multiple occurrences of the same forbidden pair within the string. It might only process the first occurrence and skip others.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the forbidden pair appears at the beginning or end of the string correctly.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
ababab
1
ab
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might output a different number because it incorrectly handles the multiple occurrences of the forbidden pair "ab".

To ensure the program works correctly, it should iterate through the string and handle each forbidden pair more robustly, ensuring that all occurrences are processed correctly and the string is updated accurately.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105; k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13; each of the k lines contains a unique pair of different lowercase Latin letters representing forbidden pairs, and each letter appears in at most one forbidden pair.
def func_1():
    string = raw_input()
    pairs_num = input()
    pairs = []

    while i < pairs_num:
        pair = raw_input()

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `string` is the input string, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 105, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 13, `pairs_num` is the original value of `pairs_num`, `pairs` is a list containing `pairs_num` unique pairs of different lowercase Latin letters, each letter appears in at most one forbidden pair, `i` is `pairs_num`.
    parser = Parser(string, pairs)
    print(parser.min_deletions())
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an input string `s` and an integer `k`, followed by `k` pairs of forbidden characters. It then computes and prints the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of the forbidden pairs from the string `s`. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result. The final state of the program includes the original string `s`, the integer `k`, the list of forbidden pairs, and the printed result representing the minimum deletions needed. Edge cases include scenarios where `k` is 0 (no forbidden pairs), `s` contains no forbidden pairs, or `s` contains multiple instances of the same forbidden pair. The function assumes that each letter appears in at most one forbidden pair, and it handles the input and computation accordingly.
