Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Conversion:**
   - The program reads the number of points `n` and then reads the coordinates of each point.
   - It converts each point \((x, y)\) into a unique integer representation \(10000 \times (x + 1000) + y + 1000\). This conversion ensures that each point is uniquely represented as an integer, which helps in efficiently checking for the midpoint condition.

2. **Sorting the Points:**
   - The program sorts the list `a` of these unique integer representations. Sorting is necessary to facilitate the efficient checking of the midpoint condition using the set `b`.

3. **Creating the Set of Doubled Points:**
   - The set `b` is created by doubling each element in the sorted list `a`. This set `b` will contain all possible values of \(2k\) where \(k\) is a point in the original list. This is used to check if the sum of two points \(u\) and \(v\) can form a valid midpoint.

4. **Counting Valid Triplets:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` and for each pair of points \(u\) and \(v\) (where \(u < v\)), it checks if \(u + v\) is in the set `b`.
   - If \(u + v\) is in `b`, it means there exists a point \(w\) such that \(w = \frac{u + v}{2}\), which implies that \(w\) is the midpoint of the segment connecting \(u\) and \(v\).
   - The program increments the count `s` for each valid triplet found.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the count `s`, which is the number of valid triplets where one point is the midpoint of the segment formed by the other two points.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Unique Representation:** The unique integer representation ensures that each point is distinct and can be easily compared.
- **Sorting and Set Operations:** Sorting the points and using a set for efficient lookups ensures that the program can quickly check the midpoint condition.
- **Correct Counting:** The nested loops and the condition `if v + u in b` correctly identify and count all valid triplets where one point is the midpoint of the segment formed by the other two points.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program correctly implements the required logic and produces the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
