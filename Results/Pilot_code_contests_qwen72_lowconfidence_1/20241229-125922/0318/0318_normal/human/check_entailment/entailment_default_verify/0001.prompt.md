You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given n points on a plane. All points are different.

Find the number of different groups of three points (A, B, C) such that point B is the middle of segment AC. 

The groups of three points are considered unordered, that is, if point B is the middle of segment AC, then groups (A, B, C) and (C, B, A) are considered the same.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3000) — the number of points. 

Next n lines contain the points. The i-th line contains coordinates of the i-th point: two space-separated integers xi, yi ( - 1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000).

It is guaranteed that all given points are different.

Output

Print the single number — the answer to the problem.

def func():

    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        a[i] = 10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000
    a.sort()
    b = set((2 * k for k in a))
    for (i, u) in enumerate(a, 2):
        for v in a[i:]:
            if v + u in b:
                s += 1
    print(s)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the points are collinear but do not form a valid middle point configuration. Specifically, the program checks if `v + u` is in the set `b`, which is constructed as `2 * k` for each `k` in `a`. However, this approach only works if the points are on a line with a slope of 1 (i.e., the points are aligned diagonally). It fails to correctly identify the middle point for other slopes.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```

The points (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4) form a valid group where (2, 3) is the middle point. Similarly, (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5) also form a valid group where (3, 4) is the middle point. However, the program will not correctly identify these groups because it only checks for a specific diagonal alignment.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the midpoint for each pair of points and check if this midpoint exists in the list of points. This would ensure that the program correctly identifies all valid groups of three points for any slope.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads `n` unique points from the standard input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 3000` and each point is represented by coordinates `(xi, yi)` within the range `-1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000`. It then transforms these points into a unique integer representation and sorts them. The function counts the number of pairs of points `(u, v)` such that the sum of their transformed representations is also present in the set of double-transformed points. Finally, the function prints the count of such pairs. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the result to the standard output. Edge cases include scenarios where no such pairs exist, resulting in a count of zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
