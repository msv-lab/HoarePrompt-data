Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has a logical issue that prevents it from correctly identifying all groups of three points (A, B, C) where B is the midpoint of segment AC. Specifically, the code incorrectly handles the transformation and comparison of points, leading to potential missed matches.

### Issues:
1. **Transformation and Comparison**:
   - The code transforms each point `(x, y)` into a unique integer `10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000`. This transformation is used to sort the points and to check if the midpoint condition is met.
   - However, the way the code checks for the midpoint condition is flawed. It creates a set `b` containing double-transformed values of all points and then checks if the sum of any two points' transformed values is in this set.
   - This approach can lead to false positives because it does not account for the fact that the midpoint of two points must be a valid point in the original set.

2. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     4
     0 0
     1 0
     2 0
     3 0
     ```
   - The correct output should be `3` because there are three valid groups: `(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)`, `(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)`, and `(0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0)`.
   - However, the provided code will not correctly identify all these groups due to the flawed midpoint check.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the code should:
1. Transform each point into a unique identifier.
2. Use a dictionary or a set to store the points.
3. For each pair of points, calculate the midpoint and check if the midpoint exists in the set of points.
4. Count the number of valid groups.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    points = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        points.append((x, y))
    
    point_set = set(points)
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            x1, y1 = points[i]
            x2, y2 = points[j]
            mid_x = (x1 + x2) / 2
            mid_y = (y1 + y2) / 2
            if (mid_x, mid_y) in point_set:
                count += 1
    
    print(count // 3)

func()
```

This corrected code correctly identifies all valid groups of three points where the second point is the midpoint of the segment formed by the other two points. It also ensures that each group is counted only once.
