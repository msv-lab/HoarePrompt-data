You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given n points on a plane. All points are different.

Find the number of different groups of three points (A, B, C) such that point B is the middle of segment AC. 

The groups of three points are considered unordered, that is, if point B is the middle of segment AC, then groups (A, B, C) and (C, B, A) are considered the same.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3000) — the number of points. 

Next n lines contain the points. The i-th line contains coordinates of the i-th point: two space-separated integers xi, yi ( - 1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000).

It is guaranteed that all given points are different.

Output

Print the single number — the answer to the problem.

Program:
```
def func():
    (s, n) = (0, int(raw_input()))
    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        a[i] = 10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000
    a.sort()
    b = set((2 * k for k in a))
    for (i, u) in enumerate(a, 2):
        for v in a[i:]:
            if v + u in b:
                s += 1
    print(s)


```
Output hints: The function reads `n` unique points from the standard input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 3000` and each point is represented by coordinates `(xi, yi)` within the range `-1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000`. It then transforms these points into a unique integer representation and sorts them. The function counts the number of pairs of points `(u, v)` such that the sum of their transformed representations is also present in the set of double-transformed points. Finally, the function prints the count of such pairs. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the result to the standard output. Edge cases include scenarios where no such pairs exist, resulting in a count of zero.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
