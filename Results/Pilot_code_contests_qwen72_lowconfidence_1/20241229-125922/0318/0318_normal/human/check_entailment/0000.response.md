Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, you should use `input()` instead. This will cause the program to fail in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Middle Point Calculation**: The program attempts to find the middle point by checking if `v + u` is in the set `b`. However, this approach is flawed because it assumes that the sum of the coordinates of the endpoints (when scaled and offset) will match twice the coordinate of the middle point. This is not a reliable way to check if a point is the midpoint of a segment. The correct way to check if a point `B` is the midpoint of `A` and `C` is to verify that the coordinates of `B` are the average of the coordinates of `A` and `C`.

3. **Set Construction**: The set `b` is constructed by doubling each element in `a`. This is intended to help with the midpoint check, but it is not a correct method for identifying midpoints in a 2D plane.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the points are collinear but do not form valid triplets where one point is the midpoint of the other two.

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
4
0 0
2 0
4 0
6 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will likely output a different result because it incorrectly checks for midpoints.

For these reasons, the program is incorrect.
