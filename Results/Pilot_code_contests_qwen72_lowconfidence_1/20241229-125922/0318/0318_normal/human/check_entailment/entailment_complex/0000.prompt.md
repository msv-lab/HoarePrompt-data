You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given n points on a plane. All points are different.

Find the number of different groups of three points (A, B, C) such that point B is the middle of segment AC. 

The groups of three points are considered unordered, that is, if point B is the middle of segment AC, then groups (A, B, C) and (C, B, A) are considered the same.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3000) — the number of points. 

Next n lines contain the points. The i-th line contains coordinates of the i-th point: two space-separated integers xi, yi ( - 1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000).

It is guaranteed that all given points are different.

Output

Print the single number — the answer to the problem.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000. Each of the next n lines contains two space-separated integers xi, yi representing the coordinates of the i-th point, where -1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000. All given points are different.
def func():
    s, n = 0, int(raw_input())
    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x, y = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        a[i] = 10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` elements where each element `a[i]` is `10000 * (xi + 1000) + yi + 1000` for the corresponding point (xi, yi), `i` is `n-1`, `x` and `y` are the last read integers from input where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, all given points are different.
    a.sort()
    b = set(2 * k for k in a)
    for (i, u) in enumerate(a, 2):
        for v in a[i:]:
            if v + u in b:
                s += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is the count of pairs `(u, v)` in `a` such that `u + v` is in `b`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` elements where each element `a[i]` is `10000 * (xi + 1000) + yi + 1000` for the corresponding point `(xi, yi)` in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `u` is the last element in `a`, `x` and `y` are the last read integers from input where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, all given points are different, `b` is a set containing elements `2 * (10000 * (xi + 1000) + yi + 1000)` for each corresponding point `(xi, yi)`.
    print(s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads `n` unique points from the standard input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 3000` and each point is represented by coordinates `(xi, yi)` within the range `-1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000`. It then transforms these points into a unique integer representation and sorts them. The function counts the number of pairs of points `(u, v)` such that the sum of their transformed representations is also present in the set of double-transformed points. Finally, the function prints the count of such pairs. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the result to the standard output. Edge cases include scenarios where no such pairs exist, resulting in a count of zero.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
