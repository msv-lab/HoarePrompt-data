Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Transformation:**
   - The program reads the number of points `n` and then reads the coordinates of each point.
   - Each point `(x, y)` is transformed into a unique integer `10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000`. This transformation ensures that each point is uniquely represented as an integer, which helps in efficiently checking the conditions using set operations.

2. **Sorting and Set Creation:**
   - The list of transformed points `a` is sorted.
   - A set `b` is created containing the double values of the transformed points. This set is used to check if the sum of any two points is twice the value of another point, which would indicate that one of the points is the midpoint of the other two.

3. **Counting Valid Triplet Pairs:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted list `a` and checks for pairs `(u, v)` such that `u + v` is in the set `b`.
   - If `u + v` is in `b`, it means there exists a point `w` such that `w = (u + v) / 2`, and thus `w` is the midpoint of the segment formed by `u` and `v`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of such valid triplet pairs.

### Why It Meets the Problem Description:

- **Uniqueness of Points:** The program assumes that all points are unique, as stated in the problem description.
- **Transforming Points:** The transformation `10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000` ensures that each point is uniquely represented as an integer, which is crucial for the set operations.
- **Checking Midpoints:** The use of the set `b` and the condition `u + v in b` correctly identifies pairs of points where one point is the midpoint of the other two.
- **Unordered Groups:** The program correctly handles the fact that the groups of three points are considered unordered, as it only counts each valid triplet once.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **No Valid Triplets:** If no valid triplets exist, the program will correctly output `0`.
- **Maximum Number of Points:** The program can handle up to 3000 points, as specified in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
