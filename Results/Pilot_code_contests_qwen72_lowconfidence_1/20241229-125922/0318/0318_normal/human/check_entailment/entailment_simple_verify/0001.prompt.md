You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given n points on a plane. All points are different.

Find the number of different groups of three points (A, B, C) such that point B is the middle of segment AC. 

The groups of three points are considered unordered, that is, if point B is the middle of segment AC, then groups (A, B, C) and (C, B, A) are considered the same.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3000) — the number of points. 

Next n lines contain the points. The i-th line contains coordinates of the i-th point: two space-separated integers xi, yi ( - 1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000).

It is guaranteed that all given points are different.

Output

Print the single number — the answer to the problem.

    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        a[i] = 10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000
    a.sort()
    b = set((2 * k for k in a))
    for (i, u) in enumerate(a, 2):
        for v in a[i:]:
            if v + u in b:
                s += 1
    print(s)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the points are collinear but do not form a valid middle point configuration. Specifically, the program checks if `v + u` is in the set `b`, which is constructed as `2 * k` for each `k` in `a`. However, this approach only works if the points are on a line with a slope of 1 (i.e., the points are aligned diagonally). It fails to correctly identify the middle point for other slopes.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```

The points (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4) form a valid group where (2, 3) is the middle point. Similarly, (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5) also form a valid group where (3, 4) is the middle point. However, the program will not correctly identify these groups because it only checks for a specific diagonal alignment.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the midpoint for each pair of points and check if this midpoint exists in the list of points. This would ensure that the program correctly identifies all valid groups of three points for any slope.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000. Each of the next n lines contains two space-separated integers xi, yi representing the coordinates of the i-th point, where -1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000. All given points are different.
def func():
    s, n = 0, int(raw_input())
    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x, y = map(int, raw_input().split())

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
