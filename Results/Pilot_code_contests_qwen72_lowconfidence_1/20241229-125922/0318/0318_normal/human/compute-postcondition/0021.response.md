Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` elements, `i` is 2, `u` is `a[2]`, `x` and `y` are the last read integers from input where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, all given points are different, `b` is a set containing elements `2 * (10000 * (xi + 1000) + yi + 1000)` for each corresponding point (xi, yi), and `v` is `a[3]`. If the sum of `v` and `u` is in `b`, then `s` is 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0.***
