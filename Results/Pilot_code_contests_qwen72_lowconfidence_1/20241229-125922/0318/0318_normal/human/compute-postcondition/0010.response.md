The value of `a[i]` is updated to `10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000`. Given that `i` is 2, the third element of the list `a` (index 2) is set to this value. The values of `n`, `s`, `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The new value of `a[2]` is `10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` zeros where `a[0]` is `10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000`, `a[1]` is `10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000`, `a[2]` is `10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000`, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers read from input where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, all given points are different.**
