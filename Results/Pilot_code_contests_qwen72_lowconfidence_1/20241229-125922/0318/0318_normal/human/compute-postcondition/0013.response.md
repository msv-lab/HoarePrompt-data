The code snippet creates a set `b` which contains elements that are double the elements in the list `a`. Each element in `a` is of the form `10000 * (xi + 1000) + yi + 1000` for the corresponding point `(xi, yi)` in ascending order. Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` elements, `b` will contain `n` unique elements, each being twice the corresponding element in `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` elements where each element `a[i]` is `10000 * (xi + 1000) + yi + 1000` for the corresponding point (xi, yi) in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `x` and `y` are the last read integers from input where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, all given points are different, `b` is a set containing elements `2 * (10000 * (xi + 1000) + yi + 1000)` for each corresponding point (xi, yi).**
