Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` elements, `x` and `y` are within the specified range and all points are different, `b` is a set as defined, `i` is 4, `u` is `a[4]`. If `v + u` is in `b`, then `s` is the count of elements in `a` starting from index 3 whose sum with `a[3]` is found in `b` plus 1. Otherwise, `s` remains the count of elements in `a` starting from index 3 whose sum with `a[3]` is found in `b`.***
