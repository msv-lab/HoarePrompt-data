Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is the count of pairs `(u, v)` in `a` such that `u + v` is in `b`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` elements where each element `a[i]` is `10000 * (xi + 1000) + yi + 1000` for the corresponding point `(xi, yi)` in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `u` is the last element in `a`, `x` and `y` are the last read integers from input where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, all given points are different, `b` is a set containing elements `2 * (10000 * (xi + 1000) + yi + 1000)` for each corresponding point `(xi, yi)`.**
