The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are now updated based on the input, but they still adhere to the constraint -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000.

The other variables (`n`, `s`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` zeros where `a[0]` is `10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000`, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers read from input where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, all given points are different.**
