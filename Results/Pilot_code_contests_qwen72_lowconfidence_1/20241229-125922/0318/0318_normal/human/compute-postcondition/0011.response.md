Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` elements where each element `a[i]` is `10000 * (xi + 1000) + yi + 1000` for the corresponding point (xi, yi), `i` is `n-1`, `x` and `y` are the last read integers from input where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, all given points are different.**
