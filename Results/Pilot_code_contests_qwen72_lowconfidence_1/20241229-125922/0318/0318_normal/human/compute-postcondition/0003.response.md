The code reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The variables `n`, `s`, and `a` remain unchanged. The variables `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers read from input where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, all given points are different.**
