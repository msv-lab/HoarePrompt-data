Functionality: ** The function reads `n` unique points from the standard input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 3000` and each point is represented by coordinates `(xi, yi)` within the range `-1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000`. It then transforms these points into a unique integer representation and sorts them. The function counts the number of pairs of points `(u, v)` such that the sum of their transformed representations is also present in the set of double-transformed points. Finally, the function prints the count of such pairs. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the result to the standard output. Edge cases include scenarios where no such pairs exist, resulting in a count of zero. **
