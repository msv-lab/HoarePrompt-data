The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `a` but does not affect the values of other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000
- `s` is 0
- `a` is a list of `n` elements where each element `a[i]` is `10000 * (xi + 1000) + yi + 1000` for the corresponding point (xi, yi)
- `i` is `n-1`
- `x` and `y` are the last read integers from input where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000
- All given points are different

After executing `a.sort()`, the list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `s`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` elements where each element `a[i]` is `10000 * (xi + 1000) + yi + 1000` for the corresponding point (xi, yi) in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `x` and `y` are the last read integers from input where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, all given points are different.**
