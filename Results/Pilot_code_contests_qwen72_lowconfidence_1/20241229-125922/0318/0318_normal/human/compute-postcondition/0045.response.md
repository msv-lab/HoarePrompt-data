Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` elements, `x` and `y` are within the specified range and all points are different, `b` is a set as defined, `i` is 4, `u` is `a[4]`, `v` is `a[5]`. If `v + u` is in `b`, then `s` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
