The code initializes a list `a` with `n` elements, each set to 0. This impacts the variable `a`, which now holds a list of zeros with a length equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, each of the next n lines contains two space-separated integers xi, yi representing the coordinates of the i-th point, where -1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000. All given points are different.**
