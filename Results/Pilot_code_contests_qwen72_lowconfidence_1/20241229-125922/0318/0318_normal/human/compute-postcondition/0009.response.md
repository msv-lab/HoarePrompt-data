The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial values of `x` and `y` before this line are not specified, but they are now updated to the values read from the input. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` zeros where `a[0]` is `10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000`, `a[1]` is `10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000`, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers read from input where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, all given points are different.**
