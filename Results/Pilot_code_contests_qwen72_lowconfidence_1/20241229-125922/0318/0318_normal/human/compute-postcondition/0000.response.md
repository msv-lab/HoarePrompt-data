The code snippet `s, n = 0, int(raw_input())` initializes the variable `s` to 0 and updates `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within the range 3 to 3000. After executing the code, `s` is set to 0, and `n` retains its property of being an integer in the specified range, now specifically the integer value provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is 0. Each of the next n lines contains two space-separated integers xi, yi representing the coordinates of the i-th point, where -1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000. All given points are different.**
