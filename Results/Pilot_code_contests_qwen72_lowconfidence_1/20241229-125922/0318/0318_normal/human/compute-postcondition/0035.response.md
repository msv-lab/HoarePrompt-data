Output State: **`n` must be at least 6, `i` is 3, `u` is `a[3]`, `v` is `a[5]`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` elements, `b` is a set as defined, `x` and `y` are within the specified range and all points are different. If the sum of `v` and `u` is in the set `b`, `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. `s` is increased by 1.**
