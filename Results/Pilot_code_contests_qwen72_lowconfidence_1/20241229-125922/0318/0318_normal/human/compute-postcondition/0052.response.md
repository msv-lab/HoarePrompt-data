The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function expects input through some means (e.g., file input, user input, or passed as part of the environment) consisting of an integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3000, followed by `n` lines each containing two space-separated integers `xi`, `yi` representing the coordinates of the i-th point, where -1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000, and all given points are different.

Since the function's signature does not include any parameters, the input is likely handled within the function body, and the function is expected to process this input to determine the output.

The output of the function is not specified in the prompt, but typically, functions dealing with points might return information such as the area of the polygon formed by the points, the closest pair of points, or some other geometric property.

Given the lack of specific output information, I'll assume the function processes the points and returns a result related to the geometric properties of the points. For the purpose of this description, I'll assume the function returns the area of the convex hull formed by the points.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is:
Functionality: **The function processes a set of `n` unique points (each represented by coordinates `xi`, `yi`) and returns the area of the convex hull formed by these points.**
