The value of `neg` is incremented by the value of `l[i]`. Since the current value of `l[i]` is less than 0, this means `neg` will be updated to a new value which is the sum of its previous value (which was 0) and the current value of `l[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `mneg` is 0, `som` is 0, `neg` is equal to `l[i]`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `l[i]` is less than 0.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `mneg` is 0, `som` is 0, `neg` is equal to `l[i]`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `l[i]` is less than 0**
