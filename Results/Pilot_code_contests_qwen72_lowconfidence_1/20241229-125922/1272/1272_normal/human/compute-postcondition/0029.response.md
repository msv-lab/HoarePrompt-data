To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and the initial state. Let's break down the loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `h` is an input integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6).
- `l` is a map object of integers from the input.
- `mneg` is 0.
- `som` is 0.
- `neg` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    if l[i] < 0:
        neg += l[i]
    else:
        if neg < mneg:
            mneg = neg
        neg = 0
    som += l[i]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list `l`.
   - For each iteration `i`:
     - If `l[i]` is negative, `neg` is incremented by `l[i]`.
     - If `l[i]` is non-negative:
       - If `neg` is less than `mneg`, `mneg` is updated to `neg`.
       - `neg` is reset to 0.
     - `som` is incremented by `l[i]`.

2. **Final State**:
   - **`som`**: This variable accumulates the sum of all elements in `l`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `som` will be the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - **`neg`**: This variable tracks the cumulative sum of consecutive negative numbers in `l`. At the end of the loop, `neg` will be 0 if the last element of `l` is non-negative or the sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers.
   - **`mneg`**: This variable tracks the minimum cumulative sum of consecutive negative numbers encountered during the loop. It will be the smallest value of `neg` that was less than any previous `mneg`.
   - **Other Variables**:
     - `h`, `n`, and `d` remain unchanged.
     - `l` remains a map object of integers from the input.
     - `i` will be `n - 1` after the last iteration.

### Output State:
- **`h`** is an input integer.
- **`n`** is an input integer.
- **`d`** is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6).
- **`l`** is a map object of integers from the input.
- **`som`** is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- **`mneg`** is the minimum cumulative sum of consecutive negative numbers in `l`.
- **`neg`** is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l`, or 0 if the last element is non-negative.
- **`i`** is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `mneg` is the minimum cumulative sum of consecutive negative numbers in `l`, `neg` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative, `i` is `n - 1`.**
