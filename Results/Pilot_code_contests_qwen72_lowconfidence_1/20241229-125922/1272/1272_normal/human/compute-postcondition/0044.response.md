To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `h` is an input integer.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `d` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `d_i` is within the range \([-10^6, 10^6]\).
   - `l` is a map object of integers from the input.
   - `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `neg` is less than `mneg`.
   - `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`.
   - `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative.
   - `mneg * -1` is greater than `h`.
   - `li` is `h + l[0] + l[1]`.
   - If `li` is less than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

### Updated State:
State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 2, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `i` is 2, `neg` < `mneg`, `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`, `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative, `mneg * -1` is greater than `h`, `li` is `h + l[0] + l[1]`. If `li` is less than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.**
