The code snippet `li += l[i]` updates the value of `li` by adding the value of `l[i]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `h` is an input integer.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6).
- `l` is a map object of integers from the input.
- `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `i` is 0.
- `neg` < `mneg`.
- `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`.
- `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative.
- `mneg * -1` is greater than `h`.
- `li` is `h`.

After executing `li += l[i]`:

- `li` is now `h + l[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `i` is 0, `neg` < `mneg`, `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`, `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative, `mneg * -1` is greater than `h`, `li` is `h + l[0]`.**
