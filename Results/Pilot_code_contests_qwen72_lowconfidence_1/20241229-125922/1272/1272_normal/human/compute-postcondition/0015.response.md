To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to run. Specifically, for the loop to execute again:

1. The variable `i` must be incremented by 1.
2. The loop condition `i < n` must still be true.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `h` is an input integer.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6).
- `l` is a map object of integers from the input.
- `som` is `l[0]`.
- `i` is 0.
- `mneg` is 0.
- `neg` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is `l[0]`, `i` is 1, `mneg` is 0, `neg` is 0.**
