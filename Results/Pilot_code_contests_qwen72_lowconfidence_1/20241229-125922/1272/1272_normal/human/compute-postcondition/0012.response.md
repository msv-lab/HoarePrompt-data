Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 â‰¤ d_i â‰¤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is 0, `i` is 0, the value of `l[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `neg` is 0, and if `neg` < `mneg`, then `mneg` is updated to the old value of `neg`, and the current value of `neg` remains 0.**
