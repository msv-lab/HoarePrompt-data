Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 â‰¤ d_i â‰¤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is `l[0]`, `i` is 1, `mneg` is 0. If `l[1]` < 0, `neg` is `neg + l[1]`. Otherwise, `neg` remains 0.***
