The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block immediately. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow control.

Given the initial state, the `break` statement will cause the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `i` is 1, `neg` < `mneg`, `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`, `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative, `mneg * -1` is greater than `h`, `li` is `h + l[0] + l[1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
