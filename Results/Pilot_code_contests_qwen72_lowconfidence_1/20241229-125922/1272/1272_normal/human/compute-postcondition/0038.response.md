The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block immediately. Since no variables are directly modified by this statement, their values remain unchanged. However, the flow of control changes, which means we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `i` is 0, `neg` < `mneg`, `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`, `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative, `mneg * -1` is greater than `h`, `li` is `h + l[0]`, and the current value of `li` is less than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
