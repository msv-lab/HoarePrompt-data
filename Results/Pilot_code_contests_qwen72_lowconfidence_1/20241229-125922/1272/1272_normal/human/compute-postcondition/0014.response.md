The code snippet `som += l[i]` updates the variable `som` by adding the value of `l[i]` to it. The initial state provides that `som` is 0 and `i` is 0. The value of `l[i]` (where `i` is 0) is added to `som`.

- `som` is initially 0.
- `l[i]` is the first element in the map object `l` since `i` is 0.
- After the execution of the code, `som` will be equal to the value of `l[0]`.

The other variables (`h`, `n`, `d`, `i`, `mneg`, and `neg`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is `l[0]`, `i` is 0, `mneg` is 0, `neg` is 0.**
