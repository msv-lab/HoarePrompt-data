To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start and run at least once. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run at all.
2. **Initialization of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly initialized. However, in Python, `xrange(n)` (or `range(n)` in Python 3) will automatically initialize `i` to 0 for the first iteration.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`h`, `d`, `l`, `mneg`, `som`, `neg`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition. They are part of the program state but do not influence whether the loop runs.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `i` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `mneg` is 0, `som` is 0, `neg` is 0, `i` is 0**
