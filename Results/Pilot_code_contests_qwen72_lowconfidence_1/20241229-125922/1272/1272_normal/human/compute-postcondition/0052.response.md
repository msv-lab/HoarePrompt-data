To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet:

```python
li = h - (h / (som * -1) - 1) * (som * -1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `h` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6).
   - `l` is a map object of integers from the input.
   - `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - If `neg` < `mneg`, then `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`.
   - `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative.
   - Additionally, `mneg * -1` is less than or equal to `h`.
   - The current value of `som` is less than 0.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The expression `li = h - (h / (som * -1) - 1) * (som * -1)` needs to be evaluated.
   - Let's break down the expression:
     - `som * -1` is a positive number because `som` is less than 0.
     - `h / (som * -1)` computes the division of `h` by the positive value `som * -1`.
     - `(h / (som * -1) - 1)` subtracts 1 from the result of the division.
     - `((h / (som * -1) - 1) * (som * -1))` multiplies the result by `som * -1`.
     - Finally, `h - ((h / (som * -1) - 1) * (som * -1))` computes the final value of `li`.

3. **Simplification:**
   - Let \( k = som * -1 \). Since `som` is less than 0, \( k \) is a positive number.
   - The expression becomes:
     \[
     li = h - \left(\frac{h}{k} - 1\right) \cdot k
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     li = h - \left(\frac{h \cdot k}{k} - k\right)
     \]
     \[
     li = h - (h - k)
     \]
     \[
     li = k
     \]
   - Therefore, \( li = som * -1 \).

### Output State:
- `h` is an input integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6).
- `l` is a map object of integers from the input.
- `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- If `neg` < `mneg`, then `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`.
- `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative.
- Additionally, `mneg * -1` is less than or equal to `h`.
- The current value of `som` is less than 0.
- `li` is equal to `som * -1`.
