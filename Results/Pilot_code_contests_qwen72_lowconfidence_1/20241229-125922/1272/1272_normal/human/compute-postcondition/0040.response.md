To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in xrange(n):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `h` is an input integer.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `d` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `d_i` satisfies `-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6`.
   - `l` is a map object of integers from the input.
   - `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `neg` is less than `mneg`.
   - `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`.
   - `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative.
   - `mneg * -1` is greater than `h`.
   - `li` is `h + l[0]`.
   - If `li` is less than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given these conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- All other variables remain the same unless they are modified within the loop body, but we are only concerned with the state before the loop body executes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `i` is 1, `neg` < `mneg`, `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`, `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative, `mneg * -1` is greater than `h`, `li` is `h + l[0]`. If `li` is less than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
