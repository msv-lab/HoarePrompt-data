The code `l = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting map object to `l`. This does not change the values of `h`, `n`, or the contents of the list `d`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 â‰¤ d_i â‰¤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input**
