Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `i` is `n - 1`. If `neg` < `mneg`, then `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`. `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative. Additionally, `mneg * -1` is less than or equal to `h`. If `som` is less than 0, `li` is equal to `som * -1 + sum(l[:i+1])` if the loop breaks at index `i` or `som * -1 + sum(l)` if the loop completes without breaking. If `som` is greater than or equal to 0, the state remains unchanged.***
