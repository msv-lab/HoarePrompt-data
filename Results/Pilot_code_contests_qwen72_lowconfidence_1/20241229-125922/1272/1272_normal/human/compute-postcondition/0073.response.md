Functionality: ** The function processes two inputs: `H` (a positive integer representing an initial health value) and `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in a list of integers `d`). The function reads these inputs from standard input and then processes the list to determine the minimum number of steps required to reduce the health value (`H`) to zero or below. If the sum of all elements in the list is non-negative, the function prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to reduce the health value to zero or below. Otherwise, it calculates the number of steps required based on the cumulative sum of negative sequences and the total sum of the list, printing the result. The final state of the program includes the printed result and the processed variables, but the original inputs `H`, `n`, and `d` remain unchanged. **

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Edge Case 1:** If the list `d` contains only non-negative numbers, the function correctly prints `-1` because the health value cannot be reduced to zero or below.
- **Edge Case 2:** If the list `d` contains only negative numbers and their sum is less than `-H`, the function correctly calculates the number of steps required to reduce `H` to zero or below.
- **Edge Case 3:** If the list `d` contains a mix of positive and negative numbers, the function correctly handles the cumulative sum of negative sequences and the overall sum of the list to determine the number of steps required.
- **Missing Functionality:** The function does not handle cases where the input values are outside the specified ranges (e.g., `H` is not a positive integer, `n` is not within the specified range, or elements in `d` are not within the specified range). This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Additionally, the function does not validate the input format, which could cause issues if the input is not provided as expected.
