Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 â‰¤ d_i â‰¤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is 0, `i` is 0, and `mneg` is 0. If `l[i]` is less than 0, `neg` is set to `l[i]`. Otherwise, `neg` is 0, and if `neg` was less than `mneg` before the update, `mneg` is updated to the old value of `neg`.***
