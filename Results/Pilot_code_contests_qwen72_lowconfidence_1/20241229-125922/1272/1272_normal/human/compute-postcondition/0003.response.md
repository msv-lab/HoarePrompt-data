The variable `som` is initialized to 0. This does not affect the values of `h`, `n`, `d`, `l`, or `mneg`. The output state includes the initial state with the addition of `som` being set to 0.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `mneg` is 0, `som` is 0**
