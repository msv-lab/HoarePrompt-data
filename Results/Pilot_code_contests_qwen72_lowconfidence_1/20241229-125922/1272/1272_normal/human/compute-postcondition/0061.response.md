Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `i` is 1, if `neg` < `mneg` then `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`, `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative, `mneg * -1` is less than or equal to `h`, the current value of `som` is less than 0, `li` is equal to `som * -1 + l[0] + l[1]`. If `li` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
