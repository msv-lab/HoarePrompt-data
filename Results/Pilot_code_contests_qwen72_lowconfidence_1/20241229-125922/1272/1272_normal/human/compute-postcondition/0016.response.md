The code `neg += l[i]` updates the value of `neg` by adding the value of `l[1]` to it. Given that `i` is 1, this operation specifically adds the second element of the map object `l` to `neg`. Since `som` is initialized to `l[0]`, it remains unchanged. The other variables (`h`, `n`, `d`, `l`, `mneg`) are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is `l[0]`, `i` is 1, `mneg` is 0, `neg` is `neg + l[1]`.**
