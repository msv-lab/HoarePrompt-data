The value of `mneg` is assigned the current value of `neg`. Since the initial value of `neg` is 0, `mneg` is also set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is `l[0]`, `i` is 1, `mneg` is 0, `neg` is 0.**
