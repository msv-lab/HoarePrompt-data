Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 â‰¤ d_i â‰¤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is `l[0]`, `i` is 1, `mneg` is 0, `neg` is 0. If `neg` < `mneg`, the values of `h`, `n`, `d`, `l`, `som`, `i`, `mneg`, and `neg` remain unchanged.***
