The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splitting the input by spaces, and assigns them to the variables `h` and `n`. This overrides the initial values of `H` and `n` with new values from the input. The list `d` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6)**
