The code snippet `li += l[i]` updates the value of `li` by adding the value of `l[i]` to it. Given the initial state, let's determine the new state:

- `h` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6) (unchanged).
- `l` is a map object of integers from the input (unchanged).
- `som` is the sum of all elements in `l` (unchanged).
- `i` is 2.
- `neg` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative (unchanged).
- `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg` if `neg` < `mneg` (unchanged).
- `mneg * -1` is less than or equal to `h` (unchanged).
- `som` is less than 0 (unchanged).
- `li` is equal to `som * -1 + l[0] + l[1]`.

Before the code execution:
- `li` is equal to `som * -1 + l[0] + l[1]`.

After the code execution:
- `li` is updated to `li + l[2]`.

Therefore, the new value of `li` is:
- `li = som * -1 + l[0] + l[1] + l[2]`.

If `li` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `i` is 2, `neg` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative, `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg` if `neg` < `mneg`, `mneg * -1` is less than or equal to `h`, `som` is less than 0, `li` is equal to `som * -1 + l[0] + l[1] + l[2]`. If `li` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
