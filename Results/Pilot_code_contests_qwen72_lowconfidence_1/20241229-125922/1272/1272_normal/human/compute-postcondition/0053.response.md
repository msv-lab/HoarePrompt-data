To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and the initial conditions:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1` (inclusive). This means `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to run at least once.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `h` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6).
   - `l` is a map object of integers from the input.
   - `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - If `neg` < `mneg`, then `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`.
   - `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative.
   - `mneg * -1` is less than or equal to `h`.
   - The current value of `som` is less than 0.
   - `li` is equal to `som * -1`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - **`i`**: The loop variable `i` should start from 0, not `n - 1`, to ensure it iterates over the entire range.

Given these points, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `i` is 0, if `neg` < `mneg` then `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`, `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative, `mneg * -1` is less than or equal to `h`, the current value of `som` is less than 0, `li` is equal to `som * -1`**.
