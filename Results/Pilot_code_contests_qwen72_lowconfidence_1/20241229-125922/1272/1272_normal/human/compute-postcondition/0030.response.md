Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `mneg` is the minimum cumulative sum of consecutive negative numbers in `l`, `neg` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative, `i` is `n - 1`. The current value of `neg` is less than the current value of `mneg`.***
