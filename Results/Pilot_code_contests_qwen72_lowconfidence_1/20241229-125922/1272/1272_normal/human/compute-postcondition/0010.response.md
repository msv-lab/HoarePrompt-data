The value of `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`. Since the current value of `neg` is less than the current value of `mneg`, the new value of `mneg` will be the same as the old value of `neg`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `mneg` is equal to the old value of `neg`, `som` is 0, `neg` is 0, `i` is 0, the value of `l[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `neg` is less than the new value of `mneg`.**
