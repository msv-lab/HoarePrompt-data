Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 â‰¤ d_i â‰¤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is `l[0] + l[1] + l[2]`, `i` is 2, `mneg` is 0. If `l[i]` (where `i` is 2) is less than 0, `neg` is updated to `l[1] + l[2]` if `l[1]` < 0, otherwise `neg` is `l[2]`. If `l[i]` is not less than 0, `neg` remains 0. If `neg` < `mneg`, `mneg` is updated to `neg`; otherwise, `mneg` remains 0.***
