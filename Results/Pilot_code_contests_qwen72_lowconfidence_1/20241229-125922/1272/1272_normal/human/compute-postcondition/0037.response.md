Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `d` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), `l` is a map object of integers from the input, `som` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `i` is 0, `neg` < `mneg`, `mneg` is updated to the current value of `neg`, `neg` remains the cumulative sum of the last sequence of consecutive negative numbers in `l` or 0 if the last element is non-negative, `mneg * -1` is greater than `h`, `li` is `h + l[0]`, and the current value of `li` is less than or equal to 0***
