You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A superhero fights with a monster. The battle consists of rounds, each of which lasts exactly n minutes. After a round ends, the next round starts immediately. This is repeated over and over again.

Each round has the same scenario. It is described by a sequence of n numbers: d_1, d_2, ..., d_n (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6). The i-th element means that monster's hp (hit points) changes by the value d_i during the i-th minute of each round. Formally, if before the i-th minute of a round the monster's hp is h, then after the i-th minute it changes to h := h + d_i.

The monster's initial hp is H. It means that before the battle the monster has H hit points. Print the first minute after which the monster dies. The monster dies if its hp is less than or equal to 0. Print -1 if the battle continues infinitely.

Input

The first line contains two integers H and n (1 ≤ H ≤ 10^{12}, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains the sequence of integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_n (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), where d_i is the value to change monster's hp in the i-th minute of a round.

Output

Print -1 if the superhero can't kill the monster and the battle will last infinitely. Otherwise, print the positive integer k such that k is the first minute after which the monster is dead.

            neg += l[i]

                mneg = neg
            neg = 0
        som += l[i]
    if neg < mneg:
        mneg = neg
    if mneg * -1 > h:
        li = h
        for i in xrange(n):
            li += l[i]
            if li <= 0:
                break
        print(i + 1)
    elif som < 0:
        li = h - (h / (som * -1) - 1) * (som * -1)
        for i in xrange(n):
            li += l[i]
            if li <= 0:
                break
        print((h / (som * -1) - 1) * n + i + 1)
    else:
        print('-1')

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a flaw in handling certain edge cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the point at which the monster's HP reaches zero or below. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Initial Negative HP Changes**:
   - The program initializes `mneg` to 0 and updates it to the minimum cumulative negative HP change within a single round. However, this approach does not account for the possibility that the initial HP reduction might cause the monster to die within the first few minutes of the first round.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Damage per Round**:
   - The program calculates the total damage per round (`som`) and uses it to determine if the monster will die. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the monster's HP might drop to zero or below within a single round, even if the total damage per round is negative.

3. **Incorrect Final Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the exact minute when the monster dies by adjusting the initial HP and iterating through the round. However, the logic used to adjust the initial HP (`li = h - (h / (som * -1) - 1) * (som * -1)`) is flawed and can lead to incorrect results.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
100 5
-50 -20 -30 10 10
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output from the Program:
```
-1
```

Explanation:
- The monster's initial HP is 100.
- In the first round:
  - After the 1st minute: HP = 100 - 50 = 50
  - After the 2nd minute: HP = 50 - 20 = 30
  - After the 3rd minute: HP = 30 - 30 = 0
- The monster should die after the 3rd minute, but the program incorrectly outputs `-1`.

This example demonstrates that the program fails to correctly handle the case where the monster's HP drops to zero or below within a single round. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes two inputs: `H` (a positive integer representing an initial health value) and `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in a list of integers `d`). The function reads these inputs from standard input and then processes the list to determine the minimum number of steps required to reduce the health value (`H`) to zero or below. If the sum of all elements in the list is non-negative, the function prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to reduce the health value to zero or below. Otherwise, it calculates the number of steps required based on the cumulative sum of negative sequences and the total sum of the list, printing the result. The final state of the program includes the printed result and the processed variables, but the original inputs `H`, `n`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
