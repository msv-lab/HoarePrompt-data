Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the correct function to use is `input()`. This could lead to compatibility issues if the program is run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Cumulative Sum**:
   - The variable `mneg` is intended to track the minimum cumulative sum of consecutive negative numbers. However, the logic for updating `mneg` is flawed. Specifically, the program only updates `mneg` when encountering a non-negative number, which can lead to incorrect values for `mneg`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Infinite Battles**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the entire round (`som`) is non-negative to determine if the battle will continue infinitely. However, this check alone is not sufficient. The program should also consider the cumulative sum of the damage over the rounds to ensure that the monster's HP can never drop to zero or below.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of the First Minute of Death**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the first minute after which the monster dies by iterating through the damage list and checking if the HP drops to zero or below. However, the logic for calculating the number of complete rounds and the remaining minutes is incorrect. Specifically, the calculation of `li` and the subsequent loop to find the exact minute is not implemented correctly.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:

Consider the following input:
```
1000 6
-100 -200 -300 125 77 -4
```

The expected output is `9`, but the program might produce an incorrect result due to the issues mentioned above.

### Corrected Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Read the inputs using `input()` (for Python 3).
2. Calculate the cumulative sum of the damage over the rounds.
3. Determine if the battle will continue infinitely by checking if the cumulative sum of the damage over the rounds is non-negative.
4. If the battle does not continue infinitely, calculate the first minute after which the monster dies by iterating through the damage list and keeping track of the HP.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    h, n = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the cumulative sum of the damage
    cumulative_sum = [0] * n
    cumulative_sum[0] = l[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        cumulative_sum[i] = cumulative_sum[i-1] + l[i]
    
    # Check if the battle will continue infinitely
    if max(cumulative_sum) >= 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Find the first minute after which the monster dies
    min_hp = h
    round_count = 0
    while True:
        for i in range(n):
            min_hp += l[i]
            if min_hp <= 0:
                print(round_count * n + i + 1)
                return
        round_count += 1

# Call the function
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles the problem as described and produces the correct output for all valid inputs.
