You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A superhero fights with a monster. The battle consists of rounds, each of which lasts exactly n minutes. After a round ends, the next round starts immediately. This is repeated over and over again.

Each round has the same scenario. It is described by a sequence of n numbers: d_1, d_2, ..., d_n (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6). The i-th element means that monster's hp (hit points) changes by the value d_i during the i-th minute of each round. Formally, if before the i-th minute of a round the monster's hp is h, then after the i-th minute it changes to h := h + d_i.

The monster's initial hp is H. It means that before the battle the monster has H hit points. Print the first minute after which the monster dies. The monster dies if its hp is less than or equal to 0. Print -1 if the battle continues infinitely.

Input

The first line contains two integers H and n (1 ≤ H ≤ 10^{12}, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains the sequence of integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_n (-10^6 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^6), where d_i is the value to change monster's hp in the i-th minute of a round.

Output

Print -1 if the superhero can't kill the monster and the battle will last infinitely. Otherwise, print the positive integer k such that k is the first minute after which the monster is dead.

If the loop completes without breaking, `li` is the sum of all elements in `l` added to `h` and `i` is `n-1`. The value of `i + 1` has been printed. If `mneg * -1` ≤ `h`, then if `som` < 0, `li` is equal to `som * -1 + sum(l[:i+1])` if the loop breaks at index `i` or `som * -1 + sum(l)` if the loop completes without breaking. If `som` ≥ 0, the state remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two inputs: `H` (a positive integer representing an initial health value) and `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in a list of integers `d`). The function reads these inputs from standard input and then processes the list to determine the minimum number of steps required to reduce the health value (`H`) to zero or below. If the sum of all elements in the list is non-negative, the function prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to reduce the health value to zero or below. Otherwise, it calculates the number of steps required based on the cumulative sum of negative sequences and the total sum of the list, printing the result. The final state of the program includes the printed result and the processed variables, but the original inputs `H`, `n`, and `d` remain unchanged.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
