Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the main problems:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, you should use `input()`. This is a significant issue because the code will not run correctly in Python 3, which is the more commonly used version today.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program attempts to track the minimum cumulative sum of consecutive negative numbers (`mneg`) and the total sum of the sequence (`som`). However, the logic for determining when the monster dies is flawed.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the monster's HP drops below zero within a single round. For example, if the monster's HP drops below zero in the middle of a round, the program might not detect this correctly.
   - The calculation for the number of complete rounds before the monster dies is also incorrect. Specifically, the line `li = h - (h / (som * -1) - 1) * (som * -1)` is not correctly handling the division and the remainder, which could lead to incorrect results.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the monster's HP never drops below zero, even after many rounds. For example, if the sum of the sequence `d` is non-negative, the program should output `-1`, but it may not do so correctly.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve the following steps:

1. **Read Input**:
   - Read the initial HP `H` and the length of the sequence `n`.
   - Read the sequence `d`.

2. **Simulate the Battle**:
   - Initialize the current HP of the monster to `H`.
   - Simulate each minute of the battle, updating the monster's HP based on the sequence `d`.
   - Keep track of the total HP change per round (`total_change_per_round`).
   - If the monster's HP drops to or below zero at any point, record the minute and break out of the loop.
   - If the total HP change per round is non-negative, the battle will continue indefinitely, and you should output `-1`.

3. **Handle Infinite Battle**:
   - If the total HP change per round is non-negative, the battle will continue indefinitely, and you should output `-1`.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - If the monster dies, output the minute at which it dies.
   - If the battle continues indefinitely, output `-1`.

### Example of a Correct Solution:

```python
def find_first_minute_to_die(H, n, d):
    current_hp = H
    total_change_per_round = sum(d)
    
    if total_change_per_round >= 0:
        # If the total change per round is non-negative, the battle continues indefinitely.
        return -1
    
    # Simulate the battle
    for i in range(n):
        current_hp += d[i]
        if current_hp <= 0:
            return i + 1
    
    # Calculate the number of complete rounds needed
    rounds_needed = (H - 1) // (-total_change_per_round)
    remaining_hp = H - rounds_needed * total_change_per_round
    
    # Simulate the final round
    for i in range(n):
        remaining_hp += d[i]
        if remaining_hp <= 0:
            return rounds_needed * n + i + 1
    
    return -1

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    H, n = map(int, input().split())
    d = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(find_first_minute_to_die(H, n, d))
```

This solution correctly handles all the cases described in the problem and ensures that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
