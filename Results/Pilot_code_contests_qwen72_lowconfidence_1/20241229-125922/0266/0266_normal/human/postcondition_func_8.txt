The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the integer `num`. The function assumes that `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `num` is an integer. If `n` or `m` is zero, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. If `n` or `m` is negative, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `range` function does not accept negative values. The final state of the program after the function call will be that the returned value is a nested list structure as described, with no side effects on the input parameters.
