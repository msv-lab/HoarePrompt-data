The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. Specifically, it returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. The function checks for the following conditions:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
3. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
4. For numbers greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks divisibility by all integers of the form 6k Â± 1 (where k is an integer) up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns `False`.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns `True`.

Potential edge cases:
- The function correctly handles the smallest prime numbers (2 and 3).
- The function correctly handles composite numbers that are divisible by 2 or 3.
- The function efficiently checks larger numbers by only testing potential divisors up to the square root of `n` and skipping multiples of 2 and 3.
