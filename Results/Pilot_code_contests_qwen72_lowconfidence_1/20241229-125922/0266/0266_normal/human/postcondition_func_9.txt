The function `func_10` accepts an integer `x`. It returns `False` if `x` is zero or if `x` is not a power of two. If `x` is a non-zero power of two, it returns `True`. Note that the return value for non-zero powers of two is `True`, not `x` as stated in the annotations. This function can be used to check if `x` is a power of two, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.
