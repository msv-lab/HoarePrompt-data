The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by spaces, and returns an iterator where each element is a string. The function assumes that the input is a single line of text. If the input is empty or contains only whitespace, the returned iterator will be empty. If the input contains non-string elements (e.g., numbers), they will still be converted to strings. The function does not handle multi-line input or leading/trailing whitespace beyond the initial strip.
