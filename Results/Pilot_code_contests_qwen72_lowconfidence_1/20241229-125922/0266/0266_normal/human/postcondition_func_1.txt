The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the standard input (e.g., keyboard input) and returns it as a string. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the input provided by the user is returned, and the program state remains unchanged except for the returned value. Potential edge cases include the user providing no input (resulting in an empty string being returned) or the user inputting special characters, which are also returned as part of the string.
