The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from `n`. For example, if `n` is 123, the function returns `[1, 2, 3]`. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified range correctly. However, it does not handle cases where `n` is outside the range 1 to 100, and it assumes that `n` is always a positive integer. If `n` were to be 0 or a negative integer, the function would still convert it to a list of digits, but this behavior is not covered by the given postconditions.
