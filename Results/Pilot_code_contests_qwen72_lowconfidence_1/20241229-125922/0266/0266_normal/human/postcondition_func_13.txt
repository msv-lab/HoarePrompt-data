The function `func_14` takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`, where `y > 0`. It returns the integer division result of `x` divided by `y` if `x` is exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If `x` is not exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y â‰  0`), it returns the integer part of the division of `x` by `y` plus 1. This ensures that the result is always an integer and, in the case of non-exact division, it rounds up to the next integer. Edge cases to consider include when `x` is negative and when `y` is 1. For example, if `x` is negative and `y` is 1, the function will return `x` if `x` is divisible by `y` or `x + 1` otherwise.
