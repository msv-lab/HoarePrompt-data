You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today the kindergarten has a new group of n kids who need to be seated at the dinner table. The chairs at the table are numbered from 1 to 4n. Two kids can't sit on the same chair. It is known that two kids who sit on chairs with numbers a and b (a ≠ b) will indulge if: 

  1. gcd(a, b) = 1 or, 
  2. a divides b or b divides a. 



gcd(a, b) — the maximum number x such that a is divisible by x and b is divisible by x.

For example, if n=3 and the kids sit on chairs with numbers 2, 3, 4, then they will indulge since 4 is divided by 2 and gcd(2, 3) = 1. If kids sit on chairs with numbers 4, 6, 10, then they will not indulge.

The teacher really doesn't want the mess at the table, so she wants to seat the kids so there are no 2 of the kid that can indulge. More formally, she wants no pair of chairs a and b that the kids occupy to fulfill the condition above.

Since the teacher is very busy with the entertainment of the kids, she asked you to solve this problem.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of kids.

Output

Output t lines, which contain n distinct integers from 1 to 4n — the numbers of chairs that the kids should occupy in the corresponding test case. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. You can print n numbers in any order.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly address the problem by ensuring that no two kids can indulge based on the conditions provided. The approach taken is to assign seats in a descending order of even numbers, which avoids the conditions for indulgence:

1. **gcd(a, b) = 1**: Since all assigned seats are even numbers, their gcd will always be at least 2 (or higher), thus avoiding this condition.
2. **a divides b or b divides a**: By assigning seats in a descending order of even numbers, no number can divide another because the difference between any two consecutive even numbers in the sequence is at least 2.

This ensures that the conditions for indulgence are never met, and the program outputs a valid set of chair numbers for each test case. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach seems to cover all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
