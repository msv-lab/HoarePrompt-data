You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Today the kindergarten has a new group of n kids who need to be seated at the dinner table. The chairs at the table are numbered from 1 to 4n. Two kids can't sit on the same chair. It is known that two kids who sit on chairs with numbers a and b (a ≠ b) will indulge if: 

  1. gcd(a, b) = 1 or, 
  2. a divides b or b divides a. 



gcd(a, b) — the maximum number x such that a is divisible by x and b is divisible by x.

For example, if n=3 and the kids sit on chairs with numbers 2, 3, 4, then they will indulge since 4 is divided by 2 and gcd(2, 3) = 1. If kids sit on chairs with numbers 4, 6, 10, then they will not indulge.

The teacher really doesn't want the mess at the table, so she wants to seat the kids so there are no 2 of the kid that can indulge. More formally, she wants no pair of chairs a and b that the kids occupy to fulfill the condition above.

Since the teacher is very busy with the entertainment of the kids, she asked you to solve this problem.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of kids.

Output

Output t lines, which contain n distinct integers from 1 to 4n — the numbers of chairs that the kids should occupy in the corresponding test case. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. You can print n numbers in any order.

Example

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
