You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today the kindergarten has a new group of n kids who need to be seated at the dinner table. The chairs at the table are numbered from 1 to 4n. Two kids can't sit on the same chair. It is known that two kids who sit on chairs with numbers a and b (a ≠ b) will indulge if: 

  1. gcd(a, b) = 1 or, 
  2. a divides b or b divides a. 



gcd(a, b) — the maximum number x such that a is divisible by x and b is divisible by x.

For example, if n=3 and the kids sit on chairs with numbers 2, 3, 4, then they will indulge since 4 is divided by 2 and gcd(2, 3) = 1. If kids sit on chairs with numbers 4, 6, 10, then they will not indulge.

The teacher really doesn't want the mess at the table, so she wants to seat the kids so there are no 2 of the kid that can indulge. More formally, she wants no pair of chairs a and b that the kids occupy to fulfill the condition above.

Since the teacher is very busy with the entertainment of the kids, she asked you to solve this problem.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of kids.

Output

Output t lines, which contain n distinct integers from 1 to 4n — the numbers of chairs that the kids should occupy in the corresponding test case. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. You can print n numbers in any order.

    func_19()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer input from the user, which is expected to be the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and returns this integer value. If the user inputs a value outside the range 1 to 100, the function will still return that value without any validation or error handling. The function does not modify any external state or variables. After the function call, the program will have a single integer value representing the number of test cases.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the standard input (e.g., keyboard input) and returns it as a string. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the input provided by the user is returned, and the program state remains unchanged except for the returned value. Potential edge cases include the user providing no input (resulting in an empty string being returned) or the user inputting special characters, which are also returned as part of the string.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a space-separated string of numbers from the user, converts each element into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. If the user inputs non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle empty input or other edge cases, such as leading/trailing spaces or multiple consecutive spaces between numbers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by spaces, and returns an iterator where each element is a string. The function assumes that the input is a single line of text. If the input is empty or contains only whitespace, the returned iterator will be empty. If the input contains non-string elements (e.g., numbers), they will still be converted to strings. The function does not handle multi-line input or leading/trailing whitespace beyond the initial strip.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated from the results of `func_3()`. The exact content of the list depends on the output of `func_3()`, which is not defined within the provided code. If `func_3()` returns an iterable, `func_5` will convert it into a list. If `func_3()` returns a non-iterable or raises an exception, `func_5` will either return a list with a single element (if `func_3()` returns a non-iterable) or propagate the exception.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  `func_6` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It modifies the system's recursion limit to 1,000,000 and sets the stack size for threads to 1,024,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread that starts the `main` function and begins executing it. After `func_6` is called, the program will continue running with the modified recursion limit and stack size, and the `main` function will be executed in a separate thread. If the `main` function contains any errors or exceptions, they will be handled within the thread, potentially leading to thread termination or other unspecified behavior. The main thread that calls `func_6` will continue executing the rest of the program concurrently with the `main` function thread.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a list or tuple with at least two elements. It returns the second element of `item`. If `item` has fewer than two elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the second element of `item` is returned, and no modifications are made to `item` itself.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of integers and returns a new list containing the elements of `l` sorted in descending order based on the values returned by the function `getKey` for each element. If `getKey` is not defined or does not handle all possible integer inputs correctly, the sorting behavior may be undefined or incorrect. If `l` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the integer `num`. The function assumes that `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `num` is an integer. If `n` or `m` is zero, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. If `n` or `m` is negative, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `range` function does not accept negative values. The final state of the program after the function call will be that the returned value is a nested list structure as described, with no side effects on the input parameters.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts an integer `x`. It returns `False` if `x` is zero or if `x` is not a power of two. If `x` is a non-zero power of two, it returns `True`. Note that the return value for non-zero powers of two is `True`, not `x` as stated in the annotations. This function can be used to check if `x` is a power of two, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and returns the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly handles the conversion of integers within the specified range to their binary string representation. Edge cases such as the minimum value (1) and maximum value (100) are handled appropriately, and the function ensures that the returned string does not contain the '0b' prefix.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from `n`. For example, if `n` is 123, the function returns `[1, 2, 3]`. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified range correctly. However, it does not handle cases where `n` is outside the range 1 to 100, and it assumes that `n` is always a positive integer. If `n` were to be 0 or a negative integer, the function would still convert it to a list of digits, but this behavior is not covered by the given postconditions.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `n` and `r`, which are non-negative integers with `r` <= `n`. It returns the integer value of the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!). However, there is a potential edge case where if `n - r` is 0, the function incorrectly uses `max(n - r, 1)` instead of `n - r`, which can lead to incorrect results when `n == r`. The correct behavior should be to use `n - r` directly without the `max` function.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`, where `y > 0`. It returns the integer division result of `x` divided by `y` if `x` is exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If `x` is not exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y ≠ 0`), it returns the integer part of the division of `x` by `y` plus 1. This ensures that the result is always an integer and, in the case of non-exact division, it rounds up to the next integer. Edge cases to consider include when `x` is negative and when `y` is 1. For example, if `x` is negative and `y` is 1, the function will return `x` if `x` is divisible by `y` or `x + 1` otherwise.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, and `p` is an integer greater than 1. It returns `res`, which is the result of raising `x` to the power of `y` modulo `p`. Specifically, the function computes `x^y % p` using an efficient algorithm known as exponentiation by squaring. After the function concludes, `x` is modified to be `x % p`, `y` is reduced to 0, and `p` remains unchanged. The initial value of `res` is 1, and it is updated during the computation based on the binary representation of `y`. If `y` is 0, `res` remains 1, reflecting the mathematical property that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are expected to be non-negative integers, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the value of `x` is the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the case where either `x` or `y` is 0, returning the non-zero value as the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function returns 0, which is mathematically consistent with the definition of GCD for non-negative integers.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function17:  The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. Specifically, it returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. The function checks for the following conditions:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
3. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
4. For numbers greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks divisibility by all integers of the form 6k ± 1 (where k is an integer) up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns `False`.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns `True`.

Potential edge cases:
- The function correctly handles the smallest prime numbers (2 and 3).
- The function correctly handles composite numbers that are divisible by 2 or 3.
- The function efficiently checks larger numbers by only testing potential divisors up to the square root of `n` and skipping multiples of 2 and 3.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output hints for function18:  The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It redirects the standard input (`sys.stdin`) to read from a file named `input.txt` and the standard output (`sys.stdout`) to write to a file named `output.txt`. After the function executes, any subsequent input operations (e.g., `input()`) will read from `input.txt`, and any subsequent output operations (e.g., `print()`) will write to `output.txt`. The function does not modify any other variables or perform any additional actions. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `input.txt` or `output.txt` do not exist, which could lead to file I/O errors.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''

            if cnt == n:
                break
        func_20()
''' 

 Output hints for function19:  The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It internally uses an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of kids. The function iterates over a range defined by the return value of `func_1()`. For each iteration, it initializes `n` again and counts down from `4 * n` to `2 * n + 2` in steps of 2, calling `func_20(i, end=' ')` with these values until it has called `func_20` exactly `n` times. After this, it calls `func_20()` without arguments. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `func_20` has been called `n` times with the specified values and `func_1()` times without arguments.
Function number 20 :
 Code:
 '''

        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function20:  The function `func_20` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the string representations of the positional arguments to a specified file or stream (`file`), which defaults to `sys.stdout`. The elements in `args` are separated by a separator (`sep`), which defaults to a single space. After printing all elements, the function appends a string specified by `end`, which defaults to a newline character. If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the buffer of the file or stream is flushed. The function does not return any value. If `args` is empty, nothing is printed except the `end` string. If `file` is not writable, the function will raise an exception.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
