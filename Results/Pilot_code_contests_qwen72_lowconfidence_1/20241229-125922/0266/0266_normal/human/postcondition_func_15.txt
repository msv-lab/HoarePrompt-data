The function `func_16` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are expected to be non-negative integers, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the value of `x` is the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the case where either `x` or `y` is 0, returning the non-zero value as the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function returns 0, which is mathematically consistent with the definition of GCD for non-negative integers.
