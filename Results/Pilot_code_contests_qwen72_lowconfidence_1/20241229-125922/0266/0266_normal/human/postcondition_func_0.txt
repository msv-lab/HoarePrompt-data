The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer input from the user, which is expected to be the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and returns this integer value. If the user inputs a value outside the range 1 to 100, the function will still return that value without any validation or error handling. The function does not modify any external state or variables. After the function call, the program will have a single integer value representing the number of test cases.
