The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 1, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer.**
