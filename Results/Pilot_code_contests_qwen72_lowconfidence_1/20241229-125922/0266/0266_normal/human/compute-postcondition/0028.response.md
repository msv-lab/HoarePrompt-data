The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. It does not alter the values of any variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `cnt` is 1
- `i` is 0
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer
- `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called
- `cnt` is equal to `n`

After executing the `break` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the control flow is affected by breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called, `cnt` is equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
