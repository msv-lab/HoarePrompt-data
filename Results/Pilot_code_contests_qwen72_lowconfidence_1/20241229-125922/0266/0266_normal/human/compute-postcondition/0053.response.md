The function `func_20(i, end=' ')` is called again with the current value of `i`, which is `2 * n`. Since `func_20(i, end=' ')` has already been called `n + 1` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2, 2 * n`, this call represents the `(n + 2)`-th time. The function `func_20()` returns a positive integer, but the specific value of the return is not specified in the initial state.

The condition `if cnt == n` is checked. Given that `cnt` is 3, and `n` is a positive integer, the condition `cnt == n` only holds true if `n` is also 3. If `n` is 3, the loop or if statement is broken out of. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `n`, we cannot definitively say whether `n` is 3 or not.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated call count for `func_20()`, and the potential breaking condition if `n` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 3, `i` is `2 * n`, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 2` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2, 2 * n, 2 * n`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer. If `cnt` equals `n` (and `n` is 3), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
