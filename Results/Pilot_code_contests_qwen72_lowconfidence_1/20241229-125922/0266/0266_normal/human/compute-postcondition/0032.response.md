The function `func_20(i, end=' ')` is called with the current value of `i` and the parameter `end` set to a space character. Since the exact implementation of `func_20` is not provided, we can only infer that this function call affects the state of the program in terms of how it handles the value of `i`. However, the initial state mentions that `i` is already defined as `i - 2` before this function call, and `func_20` will be called again with the new value of `i`.

The values of `cnt` and the requirement for `func_1` to return a positive integer remain unchanged. The specific outcome of the function call `func_20(i, end=' ')` is not detailed, so we assume it does not alter the values of `i`, `cnt`, or the behavior of `func_1`.

Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state, with the additional information that `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called.

Output State: **`i` is now `i - 2`, `cnt` is 2, `func_1()` must still return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` will be called again with the new value of `i`.**
