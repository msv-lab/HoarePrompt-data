The value of `n` is updated to the return value of `func_1()`, which is specified to be a positive integer. The values of `cnt`, `i`, and the fact that `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the specified sequence of values remain unchanged. The function `func_20()` still returns a positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (updated), `cnt` is `n`, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer.**
