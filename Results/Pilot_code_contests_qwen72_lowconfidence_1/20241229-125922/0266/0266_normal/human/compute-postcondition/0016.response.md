Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of any values and must contain at least three elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `end` defaults to a newline character, `flush` defaults to False, `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it was present, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it was present, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the third element in `args`, and `file` contains the string `sep` followed by the string representation of the first element in `args`, followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the second element in `args`, followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the third element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, `file` contains an additional `sep` at the end.***
