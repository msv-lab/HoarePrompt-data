To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `cnt` is 1.
- `i` is `2 * n + 2`.
- `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 1` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`.
- `func_20()` returns a positive integer.
- If `cnt` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for i in range(4 * n, 0, -2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` starting from `4 * n` down to `2` (inclusive) in steps of `-2`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2 * n + 2`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 2. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `2 * n + 2 - 2 = 2 * n`.

4. **Count Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `cnt` is less than `n`. Since `cnt` is currently 1, it needs to be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is `2 * n`.
- `cnt` is 2.
- `func_20(i, end=' ')` will be called with the value `2 * n`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 2, `i` is `2 * n`, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 1` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2, 2 * n`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer. If `cnt` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
