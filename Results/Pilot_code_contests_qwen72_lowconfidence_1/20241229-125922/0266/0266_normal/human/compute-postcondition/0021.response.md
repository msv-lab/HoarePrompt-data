Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of any values, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `end` defaults to a newline character, `flush` defaults to False, `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it was present, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it was present, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `end` (or a newline character if `end` was not specified), `kwargs` no longer contains 'end', and the current value of `flush` is True***
