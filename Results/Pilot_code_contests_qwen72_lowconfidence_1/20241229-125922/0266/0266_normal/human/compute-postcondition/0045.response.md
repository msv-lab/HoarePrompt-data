To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `i` is `2 * n + 2`.
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer.
- `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`.
- `func_20()` returns a positive integer.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(4 * n, 0, -2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates from `4 * n` down to `2` (inclusive) with a step of `-2`. This means the loop will execute as long as `4 * n` is greater than `0`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop variable `i` starts at `4 * n` and decrements by `2` each iteration. The initial value of `i` outside the loop (`2 * n + 2`) is irrelevant to the loop's execution because the loop reassigns `i` to `4 * n` at the start.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `4 * n` must be greater than `0`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `4 * n` will always be greater than `0`.

4. **Other Variables**: The variables `cnt` and the function calls to `func_1()` and `func_20()` do not affect the loop's ability to execute. They are part of the state but do not influence the loop's condition.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute if `n` is a positive integer, which is already given in the state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer.**
