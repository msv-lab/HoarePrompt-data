To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop:

### Given State:
- `args` is a tuple of any values.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters `'end'` and `'flush'`.
  - `'end'` defaults to a newline character (`'\n'`).
  - `'flush'` defaults to `False`.
- `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` if it was present, otherwise `' '`.
- `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` if it was present, otherwise `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is `True`.

### For Loop:
```python
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The for loop iterates over the elements in the `args` tuple.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `args` must contain at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `args` is not an empty tuple. If `args` is empty, the loop will not execute.

### Final State:
State: **`args` is a tuple of any values and must contain at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', 'end' defaults to a newline character, 'flush' defaults to False, `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it was present, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it was present, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, `x` is the first element in `args`**.
