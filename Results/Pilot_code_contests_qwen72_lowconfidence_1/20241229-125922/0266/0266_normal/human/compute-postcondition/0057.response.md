`cnt` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Since `cnt` is now 4 and `n` is 3, the condition `cnt == n` is no longer true, so we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 4, `i` is `2 * n - 2`, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 3` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2, 2 * n, 2 * n - 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer.**
