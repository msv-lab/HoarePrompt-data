The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` appends the string representation of `x` to the content of `file`. Given the initial state, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `file` already contains the string `sep` followed by the string representation of the first element in `args`, and if `at_start` is False, `file` also contains the value of `sep` appended after the first element.

Since `at_start` is False, `file` initially contains the string `sep` followed by the string representation of the first element in `args` and another `sep`.

After executing the code snippet, the string representation of `x` (the second element in `args`) is appended to the content of `file`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple of any values and must contain at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `end` defaults to a newline character, `flush` defaults to False, `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it was present, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it was present, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `file` contains the string `sep` followed by the string representation of the first element in `args`, followed by `sep`, and followed by the string representation of `x`.**
