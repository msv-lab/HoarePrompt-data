The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the loop or conditional structure it is contained within. However, since no loop or conditional structure is explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, the implication is that this `break` is part of a larger context (like a loop or an if-statement) that is not shown here. The variables and their values remain unchanged, but the control flow of the program is altered by breaking out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional.

Given the initial state and the code snippet:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `cnt` is 1 initially, but later specified to be equal to `n`.
- `i` is `2 * n + 2`.
- `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 1` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`.
- `func_20()` returns a positive integer.
- `cnt` is equal to `n`.

After executing the `break` statement:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is equal to `n`, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 1` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
