To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `cnt` is 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `func_1()` must return a positive integer.
   - `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called.
   - If `cnt` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(4 * n, 0, -2):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `4 * n`.
   - `i` decreases by 2 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0. However, this is not possible because the loop would not have started if `i` was 0 initially. Therefore, let's assume the previous iteration ended with `i` being some value greater than 0.
   - Since `i` decreases by 2 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i - 2`.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Continues:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be greater than 0 after the adjustment.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `i - 2` and it must be greater than 0.

6. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `i` is now `i - 2`.
   - `cnt` remains 1 (unless it is modified within the loop body, but we are not given such information).
   - `func_1()` must still return a positive integer.
   - `func_20(i, end=' ')` will be called again with the new value of `i`.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` will be called with `i = 2`.**
