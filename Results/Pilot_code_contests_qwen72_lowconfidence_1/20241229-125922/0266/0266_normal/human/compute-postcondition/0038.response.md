The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is contained within. Therefore, the values of `i`, `cnt`, and the conditions regarding `func_1()` and `func_20(i, end=' ')` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `cnt` is 3, `func_1()` must still return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` will be called again with the new value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
