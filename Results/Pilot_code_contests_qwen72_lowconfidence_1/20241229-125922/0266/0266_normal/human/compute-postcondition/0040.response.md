To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (value returned by `func_1()`).
- `cnt` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(4 * n, 0, -2):
    cnt += 1
    func_20(i, end=' ')
    if cnt == n:
        break
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `4 * n` down to `1` (inclusive) in steps of `-2`.
2. **Loop Body**:
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 each iteration.
   - `func_20(i, end=' ')` is called with the current value of `i`.
   - If `cnt` reaches `n`, the loop breaks.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- **`cnt`**: After the loop, `cnt` will be equal to `n` because the loop breaks when `cnt` reaches `n`.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` after the loop will be the last value of `i` before the loop breaks. Since the loop starts at `4 * n` and decrements by 2, the last value of `i` will be `4 * n - 2 * (n - 1) = 4 * n - 2 * n + 2 = 2 * n + 2`.
- **`func_1()`**: This function must still return a positive integer, as it did initially.
- **`func_20(i, end=' ')`**: This function will have been called `n` times with the values of `i` starting from `4 * n` and decrementing by 2 each time.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `cnt` is `n`.
- `i` is `2 * n + 2`.
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer.
- `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is `n`, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`.**
