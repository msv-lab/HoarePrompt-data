The code snippet calls the function `func_20` with arguments `i` and `end=' '`. Since the definition of `func_20` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact behavior or the values it might modify. However, based on the initial state, we can infer that:

- `i` is passed with the value 0.
- `end` is set to a space character.

The call to `func_20` does not change the values of `n`, `cnt`, or `i` in the initial state, as these variables are not modified within the snippet. The function `func_1` is mentioned as returning a positive integer, but it is not called in this snippet, so its return value does not affect the current state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called.**
