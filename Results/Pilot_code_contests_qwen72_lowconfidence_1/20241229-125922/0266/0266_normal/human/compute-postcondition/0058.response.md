The code snippet calls the function `func_20(i, end=' ')` again. Given that `func_20(i, end=' ')` has already been called `n + 3` times with the sequence of values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2, 2 * n, 2 * n - 2`, this call represents the `(n + 4)`-th call.

The value of `i` remains `2 * n - 2`. Since `func_20()` returns a positive integer, this call will also return a positive integer, but the specific value of the return is not specified. Therefore, the return value is not part of the updated state.

The values of `n` and `cnt` remain unchanged. The only change is in the number of times `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called, which is now `n + 4`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 4, `i` is `2 * n - 2`, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 4` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2, 2 * n, 2 * n - 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer.**
