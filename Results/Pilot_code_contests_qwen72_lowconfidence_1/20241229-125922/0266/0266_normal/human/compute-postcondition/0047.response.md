The code `func_20(i, end=' ')` is called with the argument `i` which is set to `2 * n + 2`. According to the initial state, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has already been called `n` times with decreasing values starting from `4 * n` down to `2 * n + 2`. This call is the next in the sequence, and `func_20()` is specified to return a positive integer.

Since this function call does not change the values of `n`, `cnt`, or `i`, these variables remain unchanged. However, the function `func_20()` has been called one more time, which means the sequence of calls has progressed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 1, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 1` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer.**
