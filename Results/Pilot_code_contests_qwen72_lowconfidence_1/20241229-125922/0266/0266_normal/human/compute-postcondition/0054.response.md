The `break` statement is executed, which means we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 3, `i` is `2 * n`, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 2` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2, 2 * n, 2 * n`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
