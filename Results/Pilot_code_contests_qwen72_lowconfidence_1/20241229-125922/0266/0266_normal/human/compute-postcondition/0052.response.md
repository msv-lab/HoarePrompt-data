The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` was 2, so now `cnt` is 3. The values of `n`, `i`, and the number of times `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called remain unchanged. The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement (`cnt == n`) has not been met since `cnt` is now 3 and `n` is a positive integer (which could be greater than 3).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 3, `i` is `2 * n`, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 1` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2, 2 * n`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer. If `cnt` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
