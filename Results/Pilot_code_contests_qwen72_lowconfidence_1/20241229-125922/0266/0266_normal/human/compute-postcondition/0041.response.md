The call to `func_20()` does not provide any arguments, which means it will use its default parameters. Given the initial state, we know that `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with decreasing values starting from `4 * n` down to `2 * n + 2`. However, the current call to `func_20()` without arguments does not affect these previously established calls or their outcomes.

Since `func_20()` must return a positive integer, this call will also return a positive integer, but the specific value is not provided in the initial state. The values of `n`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the function call.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is `n`, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer.**
