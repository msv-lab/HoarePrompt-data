The given code snippet is a function call `func_20()`. Based on the initial state, we know that `func_20()` returns a positive integer. However, the call to `func_20()` without arguments in this context does not specify what the return value or the side effects are, since the function's behavior with no arguments is not detailed.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `cnt` is `n`.
- `i` is calculated as `2 * n + 2 - 2 * (n - 1)`, which simplifies to `4`.
- `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`.
- `func_20()` returns a positive integer.

Since the code snippet only calls `func_20()` without any arguments, and assuming that calling `func_20()` without arguments does not modify any of the variables (`n`, `cnt`, `i`) and has no side effects other than potentially returning a value, the output state remains the same as the initial state. However, since `func_20()` returns a value, we should include this in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is `n`, `i` is `4`, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer.**
