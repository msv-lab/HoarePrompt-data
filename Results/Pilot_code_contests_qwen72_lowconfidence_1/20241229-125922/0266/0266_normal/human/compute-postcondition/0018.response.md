The provided code snippet does not change the value of `at_start` since it is already set to `False`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with no changes.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any values and must contain at least three elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `end` is a newline character, `flush` is False, `sep` is ' ' or the value of 'sep' from `kwargs`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value of 'file' from `kwargs`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the third element in `args`, and `file` contains the string `sep` followed by the string representation of the first element in `args`, followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the second element in `args`, followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the third element in `args`, followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the third element in `args`.**
