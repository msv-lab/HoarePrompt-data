To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
- `func_1()` returns a positive integer.
- `func_20(i, end=' ')` and `func_20()` are functions whose exact behavior is not specified, but `func_20(i, end=' ')` is called with decreasing values of `i` and `func_20()` is called without arguments.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(func_1()):
       n = func_1()
       cnt = 0
       for i in range(4 * n, 0, -2):
           cnt += 1
           func_20(i, end=' ')
           if cnt == n:
               break
       func_20()
   ```

2. **Inner Loop:**
   - The inner loop runs from `4 * n` down to `2` in steps of `-2`.
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 each time through the inner loop.
   - `func_20(i, end=' ')` is called with the current value of `i`.
   - The inner loop breaks when `cnt` reaches `n`.

3. **Behavior of the Inner Loop:**
   - For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs exactly `n` times.
   - After `n` iterations, `i` will be `2 * n + 2` (since it starts at `4 * n` and decrements by 2).

4. **Behavior of the Outer Loop:**
   - The outer loop runs `func_1()` times.
   - Each iteration of the outer loop resets `n` to the value returned by `func_1()`.
   - `cnt` is reset to 0 at the start of each outer loop iteration.
   - `func_20()` is called without arguments at the end of each outer loop iteration.

### Final Output State:
- The outer loop runs `func_1()` times.
- Each time the outer loop runs, `n` is reset to the value returned by `func_1()`.
- The inner loop runs `n` times, decrementing `i` by 2 each time until `cnt` reaches `n`.
- `func_20(i, end=' ')` is called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`.
- `func_20()` is called without arguments at the end of each outer loop iteration.

### Summary of the Final State:
- `n` is a positive integer, as it is reset to the value returned by `func_1()` in each iteration of the outer loop.
- `cnt` is `n` after each complete run of the inner loop.
- `i` is `2 * n + 2` after each complete run of the inner loop.
- `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2` in each iteration of the outer loop.
- `func_20()` is called `func_1()` times, each time without arguments.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is `n`, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2` in each iteration of the outer loop, and `func_20()` is called `func_1()` times without arguments.**
