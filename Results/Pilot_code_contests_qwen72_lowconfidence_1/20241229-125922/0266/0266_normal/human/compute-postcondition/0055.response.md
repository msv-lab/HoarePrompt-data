Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 3, `i` is `2 * n`, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 2` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2, 2 * n, 2 * n`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer. If `cnt` equals `n` (and `n` is 3), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
