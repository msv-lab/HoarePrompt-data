To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i in range(4 * n, 0, -2)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0 and decreases by 2 each iteration.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is now `i - 2`.
   - `cnt` is 2.
   - `func_1()` must still return a positive integer.
   - `func_20(i, end=' ')` will be called again with the new value of `i`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - **`i`**: Since `i` decreases by 2 each iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i - 2`.
   - **`cnt`**: The problem states that if `cnt` equals `n`, we break out of the loop. However, since `cnt` is 2 and no information is given about `n`, we assume `cnt` remains 2 unless explicitly incremented or decremented.
   - **`func_1()`**: It must still return a positive integer, which is a condition that needs to hold true for the loop to continue.
   - **`func_20(i, end=' ')`**: This function will be called again with the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is now `i - 2`.
- `cnt` remains 2.
- `func_1()` must still return a positive integer.
- `func_20(i, end=' ')` will be called again with the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `cnt` is 2, `func_1()` must still return a positive integer, and `func_20(i, end=' ')` will be called again with the new value of `i`.**
