The provided code snippet introduces a new variable `at_start` and assigns it the value `True`. This addition does not affect the values of `sep`, `file`, `args`, or `kwargs`, which retain their previously determined states.

Output State: **args is a tuple of any values, kwargs is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush'. 'end' defaults to a newline character, and 'flush' defaults to False. sep is the value of 'sep' from kwargs if it was present, otherwise ' '. file is the value of 'file' from kwargs if it was present, otherwise sys.stdout. at_start is True.**
