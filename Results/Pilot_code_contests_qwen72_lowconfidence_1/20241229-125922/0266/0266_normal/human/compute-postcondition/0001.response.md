The values of `sep` and `file` are updated based on the `kwargs` dictionary. If `sep` is present in `kwargs`, it is removed from `kwargs` and its value is assigned to `sep`. If `sep` is not present, `sep` is assigned the default value `' '`. Similarly, if `file` is present in `kwargs`, it is removed from `kwargs` and its value is assigned to `file`. If `file` is not present, `file` is assigned the default value `sys.stdout`.

The other keys in `kwargs` remain unchanged. The initial state mentions that `kwargs` contains optional parameters `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'`, with their default values specified.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**args is a tuple of any values, kwargs is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush'. 'end' defaults to a newline character, and 'flush' defaults to False. sep is the value of 'sep' from kwargs if it was present, otherwise ' '. file is the value of 'file' from kwargs if it was present, otherwise sys.stdout.**
