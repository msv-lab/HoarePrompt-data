The function `func_20(i, end=' ')` is called with the current value of `i`. Since the initial state indicates that `i` is defined as `i - 2`, this suggests that `i` has already been modified before this line of code. However, without the specific initial value of `i`, we cannot determine its exact new value after being passed to `func_20`. The function `func_20` does not modify the variables in the initial state (`i`, `cnt`, and the behavior of `func_1()`), and the call itself does not change these variables. The function `func_20` is expected to execute with the updated value of `i` and the argument `end=' '`, but since no return value from `func_20` is specified, we assume it does not return a value that affects the state.

Output State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `cnt` is 3, `func_1()` must still return a positive integer, and `func_20(i, end=' ')` will be called again with the new value of `i`.**
