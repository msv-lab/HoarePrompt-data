To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided and the logic of the loop:

1. **Initial State Summary**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `cnt` is `n`.
   - `i` is `2 * n + 2`.
   - `func_1()` must return a positive integer.
   - `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`.
   - `func_20()` returns a positive integer.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(func_1()):`.
   - This means the loop will execute `func_1()` times, where `func_1()` returns a positive integer.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop iterates based on the result of `func_1()`, and `func_1()` returns a positive integer, the loop will execute as many times as the value returned by `func_1()`.
   - The state variables `n`, `cnt`, and `i` are not directly modified by the loop itself, so they remain unchanged.
   - The only thing that changes with each iteration is the implicit counter of the loop, which is managed by the `range(func_1())` construct.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must still return a positive integer, and the loop counter (managed internally by the `for` loop) must increment by 1.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- The value of `func_1()` remains a positive integer.
- The internal loop counter increments by 1, but since it is managed by the `for` loop, it is not explicitly part of the state variables.
- The other state variables (`n`, `cnt`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is `n`, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer.**
