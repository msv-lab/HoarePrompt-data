Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is `n`, `i` is `2 * n + 2 - 2 * (n - 1)`, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `cnt` remains 0, `i` remains `2 * n + 2`, and `func_20(i, end=' ')` is not called.**
