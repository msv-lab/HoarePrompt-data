The code snippet sets the value of `cnt` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `cnt`, which was `n`. The other variables (`n`, `i`) remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the functions `func_1()` and `func_20()` also remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (updated), `cnt` is 0, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer.**
