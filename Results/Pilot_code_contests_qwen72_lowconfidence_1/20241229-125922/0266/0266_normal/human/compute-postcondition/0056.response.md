To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop conditions:

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `cnt` is 3.
- `i` is `2 * n`.
- `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 2` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2, 2 * n, 2 * n`.
- `func_20()` returns a positive integer.
- If `cnt` equals `n` (and `n` is 3), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(4 * n, 0, -2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than 0. The loop decrements `i` by 2 each iteration.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2 * n`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 2. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `2 * n - 2`.

### Adjustments:
- `i` should be updated to `2 * n - 2`.
- The condition `cnt == n` (where `n` is 3) should still hold true for the loop to continue. Since `cnt` is 3 and `n` is 3, this condition is met.
- The number of times `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called should be incremented by 1 because the loop will execute one more time. Thus, it will have been called `n + 3` times.

### Updated State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is 3, `i` is `2 * n - 2`, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n + 3` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2, 2 * n, 2 * n - 2`, and `func_20()` returns a positive integer. If `cnt` equals `n` (and `n` is 3), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
