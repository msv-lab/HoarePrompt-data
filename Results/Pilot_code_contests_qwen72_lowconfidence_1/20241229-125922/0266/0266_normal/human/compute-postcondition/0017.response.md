Initial State: `args` is a tuple of any values and must contain at least three elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `end` defaults to a newline character, `flush` defaults to False, `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it was present, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it was present, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the third element in `args`, and `file` contains the string `sep` followed by the string representation of the first element in `args`, followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the second element in `args`, followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the third element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, `file` contains an additional `sep` at the end.

The code `file.write(str(x))` appends the string representation of `x` to the `file`.

Since `x` is the third element in `args`, and `file` already contains the string `sep` followed by the string representation of the first element in `args`, followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the second element in `args`, followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the third element in `args`, and an additional `sep` at the end (because `at_start` is False), appending `str(x)` to `file` will add another occurrence of the string representation of the third element in `args`.

Therefore, the updated content of `file` will be:
- `sep` + str(first element in `args`) + `sep` + str(second element in `args`) + `sep` + str(third element in `args`) + `sep` + str(third element in `args`)

The states of the other variables (`args`, `kwargs`, `end`, `flush`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any values and must contain at least three elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `end` is a newline character, `flush` is False, `sep` is ' ' or the value of 'sep' from `kwargs`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value of 'file' from `kwargs`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the third element in `args`, and `file` contains the string `sep` followed by the string representation of the first element in `args`, followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the second element in `args`, followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the third element in `args`, followed by `sep`, followed by the string representation of the third element in `args`.**
