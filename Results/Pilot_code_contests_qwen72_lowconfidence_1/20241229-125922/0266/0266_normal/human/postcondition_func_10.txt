The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and returns the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly handles the conversion of integers within the specified range to their binary string representation. Edge cases such as the minimum value (1) and maximum value (100) are handled appropriately, and the function ensures that the returned string does not contain the '0b' prefix.
