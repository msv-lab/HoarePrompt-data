#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as arguments to the function `func_1`. This function is designed to read an integer input from the user, which is expected to be the number of test cases t, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, representing the number of test cases t.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer input from the user, which is expected to be the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and returns this integer value. If the user inputs a value outside the range 1 to 100, the function will still return that value without any validation or error handling. The function does not modify any external state or variables. After the function call, the program will have a single integer value representing the number of test cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed to the function, and it reads input from the standard input.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the standard input (e.g., keyboard input) and returns it as a string. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the input provided by the user is returned, and the program state remains unchanged except for the returned value. Potential edge cases include the user providing no input (resulting in an empty string being returned) or the user inputting special characters, which are also returned as part of the string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. The function `func_3` does not take any parameters and is used to read input from the user, converting it into a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the user's space-separated input into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:`func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a space-separated string of numbers from the user, converts each element into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. If the user inputs non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle empty input or other edge cases, such as leading/trailing spaces or multiple consecutive spaces between numbers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is used to read input, so it does not have preconditions related to input parameters.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns an iterator that converts each element from the input (split by spaces) into a string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by spaces, and returns an iterator where each element is a string. The function assumes that the input is a single line of text. If the input is empty or contains only whitespace, the returned iterator will be empty. If the input contains non-string elements (e.g., numbers), they will still be converted to strings. The function does not handle multi-line input or leading/trailing whitespace beyond the initial strip.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature. The function `func_5` does not take any parameters and is assumed to rely on other functions or global variables for its operation.
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated from the results of `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the initial state, the exact content of the list cannot be determined, but it will contain whatever `func_3()` returns.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated from the results of `func_3()`. The exact content of the list depends on the output of `func_3()`, which is not defined within the provided code. If `func_3()` returns an iterable, `func_5` will convert it into a list. If `func_3()` returns a non-iterable or raises an exception, `func_5` will either return a list with a single element (if `func_3()` returns a non-iterable) or propagate the exception.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters and does not have any specific preconditions related to input values.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:`func_6` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It modifies the system's recursion limit to 1,000,000 and sets the stack size for threads to 1,024,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread that starts the `main` function and begins executing it. After `func_6` is called, the program will continue running with the modified recursion limit and stack size, and the `main` function will be executed in a separate thread. If the `main` function contains any errors or exceptions, they will be handled within the thread, potentially leading to thread termination or other unspecified behavior. The main thread that calls `func_6` will continue executing the rest of the program concurrently with the `main` function thread.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a list or tuple with at least two elements.
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the second element of the list or tuple 'item'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a list or tuple with at least two elements. It returns the second element of `item`. If `item` has fewer than two elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the second element of `item` is returned, and no modifications are made to `item` itself.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers.
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list of integers from `l` sorted in descending order based on the values returned by the function `getKey` for each element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of integers and returns a new list containing the elements of `l` sorted in descending order based on the values returned by the function `getKey` for each element. If `getKey` is not defined or does not handle all possible integer inputs correctly, the sorting behavior may be undefined or incorrect. If `l` is empty, the function returns an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, num is an integer.
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the integer `num`, and there are `n` such inner lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the integer `num`. The function assumes that `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `num` is an integer. If `n` or `m` is zero, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. If `n` or `m` is negative, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `range` function does not accept negative values. The final state of the program after the function call will be that the returned value is a nested list structure as described, with no side effects on the input parameters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer.
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns `False` if `x` is zero or if `x` is not a power of two. If `x` is a non-zero power of two, the program returns `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts an integer `x`. It returns `False` if `x` is zero or if `x` is not a power of two. If `x` is a non-zero power of two, it returns `True`. Note that the return value for non-zero powers of two is `True`, not `x` as stated in the annotations. This function can be used to check if `x` is a power of two, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of the integer n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) as a string without the '0b' prefix.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and returns the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly handles the conversion of integers within the specified range to their binary string representation. Edge cases such as the minimum value (1) and maximum value (100) are handled appropriately, and the function ensures that the returned string does not contain the '0b' prefix.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from the integer `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from `n`. For example, if `n` is 123, the function returns `[1, 2, 3]`. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified range correctly. However, it does not handle cases where `n` is outside the range 1 to 100, and it assumes that `n` is always a positive integer. If `n` were to be 0 or a negative integer, the function would still convert it to a list of digits, but this behavior is not covered by the given postconditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers such that r <= n.
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
    #The program returns the integer value of the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!), where n and r are non-negative integers and r <= n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `n` and `r`, which are non-negative integers with `r` <= `n`. It returns the integer value of the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!). However, there is a potential edge case where if `n - r` is 0, the function incorrectly uses `max(n - r, 1)` instead of `n - r`, which can lead to incorrect results when `n == r`. The correct behavior should be to use `n - r` directly without the `max` function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that y > 0.
def func_14(x, y):
    if (x % y == 0) :
        return x // y
        #The program returns the integer division result of x divided by y, which is an integer since x is divisible by y (i.e., x % y == 0).
    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #The program returns the integer part of the division of x by y (which is not a multiple due to x % y ≠ 0) plus 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`, where `y > 0`. It returns the integer division result of `x` divided by `y` if `x` is exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If `x` is not exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y ≠ 0`), it returns the integer part of the division of `x` by `y` plus 1. This ensures that the result is always an integer and, in the case of non-exact division, it rounds up to the next integer. Edge cases to consider include when `x` is negative and when `y` is 1. For example, if `x` is negative and `y` is 1, the function will return `x` if `x` is divisible by `y` or `x + 1` otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and p are integers where p > 1, x >= 0, and y >= 0.
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the result of repeatedly squaring the original value of `x` modulo `p` for each bit in the binary representation of the original `y`, `res` is the result of multiplying `res` by `x` modulo `p` whenever the corresponding bit in the original `y` is 1, `p` remains unchanged as an integer where `p > 1`
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, which is the result of multiplying `res` by `x` modulo `p` for each bit in the binary representation of the original `y` that is 1. Since the original `y` is 0, no bits are set to 1, and thus `res` remains unchanged from its initial value (which is not specified but typically starts as 1). The value of `p` remains unchanged and is an integer greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, and `p` is an integer greater than 1. It returns `res`, which is the result of raising `x` to the power of `y` modulo `p`. Specifically, the function computes `x^y % p` using an efficient algorithm known as exponentiation by squaring. After the function concludes, `x` is modified to be `x % p`, `y` is reduced to 0, and `p` remains unchanged. The initial value of `res` is 1, and it is updated during the computation based on the binary representation of `y`. If `y` is 0, `res` remains 1, reflecting the mathematical property that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are expected to be non-negative integers, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the value of `x` is the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the case where either `x` or `y` is 0, returning the non-zero value as the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function returns 0, which is mathematically consistent with the definition of GCD for non-negative integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_17(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than 1
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1 and greater than 3, and n is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1 and greater than 3, not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, and must be such that for all `i` starting from 5 up to the largest integer `k` where `k * k <= n`, `n` is not divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n` that is congruent to 5 modulo 6.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. Specifically, it returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. The function checks for the following conditions:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
3. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
4. For numbers greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks divisibility by all integers of the form 6k ± 1 (where k is an integer) up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns `False`.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns `True`.

Potential edge cases:
- The function correctly handles the smallest prime numbers (2 and 3).
- The function correctly handles composite numbers that are divisible by 2 or 3.
- The function efficiently checks larger numbers by only testing potential divisors up to the square root of `n` and skipping multiples of 2 and 3.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are relevant to the problem's input or output constraints. This function appears to redirect standard input and output to files, which is a side functionality and does not involve any of the problem's core variables.
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It redirects the standard input (`sys.stdin`) to read from a file named `input.txt` and the standard output (`sys.stdout`) to write to a file named `output.txt`. After the function executes, any subsequent input operations (e.g., `input()`) will read from `input.txt`, and any subsequent output operations (e.g., `print()`) will write to `output.txt`. The function does not modify any other variables or perform any additional actions. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `input.txt` or `output.txt` do not exist, which could lead to file I/O errors.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is `n`, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(i, end=' ')` has been called `n` times with the values `4 * n, 4 * n - 2, 4 * n - 4, ..., 2 * n + 2` in each iteration of the outer loop, and `func_20()` is called `func_1()` times without arguments.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It internally uses an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of kids. The function iterates over a range defined by the return value of `func_1()`. For each iteration, it initializes `n` again and counts down from `4 * n` to `2 * n + 2` in steps of 2, calling `func_20(i, end=' ')` with these values until it has called `func_20` exactly `n` times. After this, it calls `func_20()` without arguments. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `func_20` has been called `n` times with the specified values and `func_1()` times without arguments.

If `flush` is True, `file` has flushed its buffer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the string representations of the positional arguments to a specified file or stream (`file`), which defaults to `sys.stdout`. The elements in `args` are separated by a separator (`sep`), which defaults to a single space. After printing all elements, the function appends a string specified by `end`, which defaults to a newline character. If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the buffer of the file or stream is flushed. The function does not return any value. If `args` is empty, nothing is printed except the `end` string. If `file` is not writable, the function will raise an exception.
