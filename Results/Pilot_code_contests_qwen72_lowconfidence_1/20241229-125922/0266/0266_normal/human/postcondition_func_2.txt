`func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a space-separated string of numbers from the user, converts each element into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. If the user inputs non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle empty input or other edge cases, such as leading/trailing spaces or multiple consecutive spaces between numbers.
