You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Today the kindergarten has a new group of n kids who need to be seated at the dinner table. The chairs at the table are numbered from 1 to 4n. Two kids can't sit on the same chair. It is known that two kids who sit on chairs with numbers a and b (a ≠ b) will indulge if: 

  1. gcd(a, b) = 1 or, 
  2. a divides b or b divides a. 



gcd(a, b) — the maximum number x such that a is divisible by x and b is divisible by x.

For example, if n=3 and the kids sit on chairs with numbers 2, 3, 4, then they will indulge since 4 is divided by 2 and gcd(2, 3) = 1. If kids sit on chairs with numbers 4, 6, 10, then they will not indulge.

The teacher really doesn't want the mess at the table, so she wants to seat the kids so there are no 2 of the kid that can indulge. More formally, she wants no pair of chairs a and b that the kids occupy to fulfill the condition above.

Since the teacher is very busy with the entertainment of the kids, she asked you to solve this problem.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of kids.

Output

Output t lines, which contain n distinct integers from 1 to 4n — the numbers of chairs that the kids should occupy in the corresponding test case. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. You can print n numbers in any order.
