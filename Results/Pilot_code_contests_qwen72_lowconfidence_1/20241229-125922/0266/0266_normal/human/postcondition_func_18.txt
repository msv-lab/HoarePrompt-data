The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It internally uses an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of kids. The function iterates over a range defined by the return value of `func_1()`. For each iteration, it initializes `n` again and counts down from `4 * n` to `2 * n + 2` in steps of 2, calling `func_20(i, end=' ')` with these values until it has called `func_20` exactly `n` times. After this, it calls `func_20()` without arguments. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `func_20` has been called `n` times with the specified values and `func_1()` times without arguments.
