The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, and `p` is an integer greater than 1. It returns `res`, which is the result of raising `x` to the power of `y` modulo `p`. Specifically, the function computes `x^y % p` using an efficient algorithm known as exponentiation by squaring. After the function concludes, `x` is modified to be `x % p`, `y` is reduced to 0, and `p` remains unchanged. The initial value of `res` is 1, and it is updated during the computation based on the binary representation of `y`. If `y` is 0, `res` remains 1, reflecting the mathematical property that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
