The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `n` and `r`, which are non-negative integers with `r` <= `n`. It returns the integer value of the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!). However, there is a potential edge case where if `n - r` is 0, the function incorrectly uses `max(n - r, 1)` instead of `n - r`, which can lead to incorrect results when `n == r`. The correct behavior should be to use `n - r` directly without the `max` function.
