The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the problem statement, it is implied that the function reads input consisting of an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10), followed by 4n + 1 lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (where 0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50). These points represent coordinates on a plane, and it is guaranteed that there are at least `n` points on each side of an axis-aligned square, with all 4n + 1 points being distinct.

The function's purpose is to process these inputs and determine the coordinates of the smallest axis-aligned square that contains at least `n` points on each of its four sides. The function returns the coordinates of the bottom-left and top-right corners of this square.

Functionality: **The function processes input consisting of an integer `n` and 4n + 1 pairs of integer coordinates. It returns the coordinates of the bottom-left and top-right corners of the smallest axis-aligned square that contains at least `n` points on each of its four sides.**
