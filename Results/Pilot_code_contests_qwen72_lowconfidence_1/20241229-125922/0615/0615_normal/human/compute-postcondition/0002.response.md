The provided code defines a lambda function `get_col` that takes an array `arr` and an index `i`, and returns a list consisting of the elements at index `i` for each row in `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- An integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) is provided.
- There are 4n + 1 lines of input, each containing two integers `x_i, y_i` (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50).
- There are at least n points on each side of an axis-aligned square, and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.
- `rints` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns a list of integers.
- `rints_2d` is a function that reads `n` lines from stdin and returns a list of lists of integers.

The code does not modify any of the existing variables or read any input. It only defines a new function `get_col`.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by 4n + 1 lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50). It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of an axis-aligned square, and all 4n + 1 points are distinct. `rints` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns a list of integers. `rints_2d` is a function that reads `n` lines from stdin and returns a list of lists of integers. `get_col` is a lambda function that extracts the ith column from a 2D array.**
