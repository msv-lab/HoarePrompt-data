Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 0, each containing two integers read from stdin, `memx` is `[float('inf'), -1]`, `memy` is `[float('inf'), -1]`, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. The count of the x-coordinate `x` in `xs` is greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`.***
