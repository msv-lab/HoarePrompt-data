Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers read from stdin. `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. `memx` is `[min(x for x in xs if xs[x] >= (n - 1) >> 2), max(x for x in xs if xs[x] >= (n - 1) >> 2)]` if there exists any x-coordinate in `xs` that meets the condition `xs[x] >= (n - 1) >> 2`; otherwise, `memx` remains `[float('inf'), -1]`. Similarly, `memy` is `[min(y for y in ys if ys[y] >= (n - 1) >> 2), max(y for y in ys if ys[y] >= (n - 1) >> 2)]` if there exists any y-coordinate in `ys` that meets the condition `ys[y] >= (n - 1) >> 2`; otherwise, `memy` remains `[float('inf'), -1]`.**
