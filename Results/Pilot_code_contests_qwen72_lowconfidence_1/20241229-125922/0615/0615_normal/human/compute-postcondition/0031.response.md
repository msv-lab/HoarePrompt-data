The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. This means that no further lines of code will be executed after this point, and the program will end.

Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the initial state, but the program execution stops. Since the `exit()` function does not modify any variables, the output state includes all the preconditions without any changes.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers, where `n` is at least 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. The next pair `(x, y)` is the (i+1)-th element in `a`, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`. The program has terminated.**
