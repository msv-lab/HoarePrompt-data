The code `n = int(input()) * 4 + 1` modifies the variable `n`. Initially, `n` is described as an integer in the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. After executing the code, `n` is updated to be 4 times its original value plus 1. This means the new value of `n` will be in the range 9 to 41, depending on the original value of `n`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged, including the details about the input consisting of an integer `n` followed by 4n + 1 lines, each containing two integers, and the functions `rints`, `rints_2d`, and `get_col`.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer n (9 ≤ n ≤ 41) followed by 4n + 1 lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50). It is guaranteed that there are at least n/4 points on each side of an axis-aligned square, and all 4n + 1 points are distinct. `rints` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns a list of integers. `rints_2d` is a function that reads `n` lines from stdin and returns a list of lists of integers. `get_col` is a lambda function that extracts the ith column from a 2D array.**
