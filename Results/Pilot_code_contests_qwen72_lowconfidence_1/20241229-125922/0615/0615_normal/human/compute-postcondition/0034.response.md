The given code prints the values of `x` and `y` from the (i+2)-th element in the list `a`. Since the condition `(memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or (x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]))` is satisfied, the program continues and the values of `x` and `y` are printed. No variables are modified by this print statement.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers, where `n` is at least 2, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. The next pair `(x, y)` is the (i+2)-th element in `a`, and `i + 2` must be less than `n`. The condition `(memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or (x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]))` is satisfied, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed.**
