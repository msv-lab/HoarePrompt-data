The code snippet updates the value of `memx` based on the current value of `x`. The rest of the conditions and the value of `memy` remain unchanged unless explicitly specified. Here's the step-by-step impact and calculation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`.
   - `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`.
   - `(x, y)` is the next element in `a`.
   - If `ys[y] >= (n - 1) >> 2`, then `memy` is updated to `[min(memy[0], y), max(memy[1], y)]` while `memx` retains its original value.
   - Otherwise, `memx` and `memy` retain their original values.

2. **Code Impact:**
   - The code `memx = [min(memx[0], x), max(memx[1], x)]` updates `memx` to the minimum and maximum of the current `memx` values and the new `x` value.
   - This means `memx[0]` will be the minimum of the current `memx[0]` and `x`.
   - Similarly, `memx[1]` will be the maximum of the current `memx[1]` and `x`.

3. **Output State:**
   - `a` remains a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `xs` remains a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`.
   - `ys` remains a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`.
   - `(x, y)` remains the next element in `a`.
   - `memx` is updated to `[min(memx[0], x), max(memx[1], x)]`.
   - The condition `if ys[y] >= (n - 1) >> 2` does not affect the value of `memx` in this context, so `memy` retains its original value unless explicitly updated elsewhere.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`, `(x, y)` is the next element in `a`, `memx` is `[min(memx[0], x), max(memx[1], x)]`, `memy` retains its original value.**
