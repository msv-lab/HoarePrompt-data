To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers read from `stdin`.
- `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`.
- `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`.
- `memx` is calculated based on the x-coordinates that meet the condition `xs[x] >= (n - 1) >> 2`.
- `memy` is calculated based on the y-coordinates that meet the condition `ys[y] >= (n - 1) >> 2`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for (x, y) in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `(x, y)` in the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element (i.e., `n` must be at least 1).

### Adjustments Needed:
- `a` must be a non-empty list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers.
- The initial state of `a` should be such that it contains at least one element.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers, where `n` is at least 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. `memx` and `memy` are calculated as described, but their values are not directly relevant to the loop execution.**
