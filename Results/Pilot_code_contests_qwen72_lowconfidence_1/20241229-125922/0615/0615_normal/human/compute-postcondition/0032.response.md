Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers, where `n` is at least 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. The next pair `(x, y)` is the (i+1)-th element in `a`, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`. If the condition `(memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or (x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]))` is not satisfied, the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues executing.***
