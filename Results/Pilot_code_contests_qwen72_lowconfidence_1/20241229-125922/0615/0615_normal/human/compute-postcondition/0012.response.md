Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 0, each containing two integers read from stdin. `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. If the count of the x-coordinate `x` in `xs` is greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`, then `memx` is `[x, x]` and `memy` is `[y, y]` if the count of the y-coordinate `y` in `ys` is also greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`. Otherwise, if the count of the y-coordinate `y` in `ys` is greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`, `memx` is `[float('inf'), -1]` and `memy` is `[y, y]`. If neither condition is met, `memx` and `memy` retain their original values `[float('inf'), -1]`.***
