Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. If `ys[y] >= (n - 1) >> 2`, then `memy` is updated to `[min(memy[0], y), max(memy[1], y)]` while `memx` retains its original value. Otherwise, `memx` and `memy` retain their original values.***
