Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers, where `n` is at least 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. `memx` and `memy` are calculated as described, but their values are not directly relevant to the loop execution. The current state is such that it is not true that (`memx[0] < x < memx[1]` and `y` is in `memy`) or (`x` is in `memx` and `memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]`).***
