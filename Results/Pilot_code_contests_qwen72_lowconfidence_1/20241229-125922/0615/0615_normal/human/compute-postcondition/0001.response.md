The code snippet defines a lambda function named `rints_2d` which, when called with an argument `n`, reads `n` lines from the standard input, each converted into a list of integers, and returns these lists as a list of lists.

- `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10.
- The input conditions about the points and the `rints` function remain unchanged.
- A new function `rints_2d` is defined, which can be used to read `n` lines of input and convert each line into a list of integers.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by 4n + 1 lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50). It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of an axis-aligned square, and all 4n + 1 points are distinct. `rints` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns a list of integers. `rints_2d` is a function that reads `n` lines from stdin and returns a list of lists of integers.**
