The function `rints` is defined to read a line from standard input (`stdin`) and convert the space-separated values into a list of integers.

Given the initial state, the function `rints` will read the next line of input when called and split it into a list of integers. Since no call to `rints` is made within the provided code snippet, the function definition itself does not change any variables or state directly. The initial state remains unchanged, but the function `rints` is now available for use.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by 4n + 1 lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50). It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of an axis-aligned square, and all 4n + 1 points are distinct. `rints` is a function that reads a line from stdin and returns a list of integers.**
