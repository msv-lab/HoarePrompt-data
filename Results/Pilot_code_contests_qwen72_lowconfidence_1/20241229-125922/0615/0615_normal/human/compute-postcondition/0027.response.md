The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. No further statements in the program will be executed, and the program will end without altering the values of any variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the program has terminated.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers, where `n` is at least 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. `memx` and `memy` are calculated as described, but their values are not directly relevant to the loop execution. The current state is such that it is not true that (`memx[0] < x < memx[1]` and `y` is in `memy`) or (`x` is in `memx` and `memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]`). The values of `x` and `y` have been printed, and the program has terminated.**
