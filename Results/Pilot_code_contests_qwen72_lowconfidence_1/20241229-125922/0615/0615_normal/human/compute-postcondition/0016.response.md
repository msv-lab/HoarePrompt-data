The code snippet updates the `memy` list by setting its first element to the minimum of its current first element and `y`, and its second element to the maximum of its current second element and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 1.
- `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`.
- `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`.
- If `xs[x] >= (n - 1) >> 2`, then `memx` is updated to `[min(memx[0], x), max(memx[1], x)]` while `memy` retains its original value. Otherwise, `memx` and `memy` retain their original values.

After executing the code snippet:
- `memy` is updated to `[min(memy[0], y), max(memy[1], y)]`.
- The values of `a`, `xs`, `ys`, and `memx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`, `memx` is unchanged, `memy` is `[min(memy[0], y), max(memy[1], y)]`.**
