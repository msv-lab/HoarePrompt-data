The provided code snippet initializes two `Counter` objects, `xs` and `ys`, using the first and second columns of the list `a`, respectively. The function `get_col(a, 0)` retrieves the first column (x-coordinates), and `get_col(a, 1)` retrieves the second column (y-coordinates) of the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers read from stdin.
- `memx` is `[float('inf'), -1]`.
- `memy` is `[float('inf'), -1]`.

After executing the code:
- `xs` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`.
- `ys` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`.

The values of `memx` and `memy` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers read from stdin, `memx` is `[float('inf'), -1]`, `memy` is `[float('inf'), -1]`, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`.**
