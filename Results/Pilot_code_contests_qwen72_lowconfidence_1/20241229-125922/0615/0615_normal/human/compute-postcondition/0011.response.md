The code snippet updates the `memy` list by setting its first element to the minimum of its current first element and `y`, and its second element to the maximum of its current second element and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 0, each containing two integers read from stdin.
- `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`.
- `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`.
- If the count of the x-coordinate `x` in `xs` is greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`, then `memx` is `[x, x]` and `memy` remains `[float('inf'), -1]`. Otherwise, `memx` and `memy` retain their original values `[float('inf'), -1]`.
- The current value of `ys[y]` is greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`.

The code snippet:
```python
memy = [min(memy[0], y), max(memy[1], y)]
```

Impact:
- `memy[0]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `y`.
- `memy[1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y`.

Since `memy` initially is `[float('inf'), -1]`, and `y` is such that `ys[y]` is greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`, the new values of `memy` will be:
- `memy[0]` will be `y` because `y` is less than `float('inf')`.
- `memy[1]` will be `y` because `y` is greater than `-1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 0, each containing two integers read from stdin.
- `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`.
- `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`.
- If the count of the x-coordinate `x` in `xs` is greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`, then `memx` is `[x, x]` and `memy` is now `[y, y]`. Otherwise, `memx` is `[float('inf'), -1]` and `memy` is `[y, y]`.
- The current value of `ys[y]` is greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 0, each containing two integers read from stdin, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`, if the count of the x-coordinate `x` in `xs` is greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`, then `memx` is `[x, x]` and `memy` is `[y, y]`, otherwise `memx` is `[float('inf'), -1]` and `memy` is `[y, y]`, the current value of `ys[y]` is greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`.**
