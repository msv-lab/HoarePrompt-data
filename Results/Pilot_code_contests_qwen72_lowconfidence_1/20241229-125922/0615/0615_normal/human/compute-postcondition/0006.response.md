To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information:

- `a` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains two integers read from stdin.
- `memx` is initialized as `[float('inf'), -1]`.
- `memy` is initialized as `[float('inf'), -1]`.
- `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`.
- `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`.

The for loop is:
```python
for (x, y) in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop `for (x, y) in a:` will execute if and only if the list `a` is not empty. This means `n` must be greater than 0 because `a` is a list of `n` lists.

2. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `a` must be a non-empty list of lists, where each sublist contains two integers.
   - The variables `memx` and `memy` are already initialized and do not affect the loop execution.
   - The `Counter` objects `xs` and `ys` are already initialized based on the contents of `a`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one sublist. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 0, each containing two integers read from stdin, `memx` is `[float('inf'), -1]`, `memy` is `[float('inf'), -1]`, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`**.
