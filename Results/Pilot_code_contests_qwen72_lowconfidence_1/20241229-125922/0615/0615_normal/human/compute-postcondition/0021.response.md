The code snippet updates the `memy` list by setting its first element to the minimum of its current first element and `y`, and its second element to the maximum of its current second element and `y`.

- `memy[0]` is updated to `min(memy[0], y)`.
- `memy[1]` is updated to `max(memy[1], y)`.

The other variables (`a`, `xs`, `ys`, `x`, `memx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`, `(x, y)` is the next element in `a`, `memx` retains its original value, `memy` is updated to `[min(memy[0], y), max(memy[1], y)]`**.
