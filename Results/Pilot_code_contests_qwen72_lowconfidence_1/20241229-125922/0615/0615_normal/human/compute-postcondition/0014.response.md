The code snippet updates the `memx` list by setting its first element to the minimum of the current first element of `memx` and `x`, and its second element to the maximum of the current second element of `memx` and `x`.

- `memx` was previously defined and retains its original values before the update.
- `x` is a variable whose value is derived from the context (likely from the `a` list or elsewhere, but not specified in the initial state).

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 1.
- `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`.
- `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`.
- `memx` and `memy` retain their values as described.

After executing the code:
- `memx[0]` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `x`.
- `memx[1]` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `x`.
- `memy` remains unchanged.
- The values of `a`, `xs`, and `ys` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`, `memx` is `[min(memx[0], x), max(memx[1], x)]`, `memy` retains its original value.**
