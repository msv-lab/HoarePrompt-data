Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers, where `n` is at least 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. `memx` and `memy` are calculated as described. After all iterations of the loop, if the condition `(memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or (x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]))` is satisfied for every pair `(x, y)` in `a`, the program completes without printing any values. If the condition is not satisfied for any pair `(x, y)` in `a`, the values of `x` and `y` for that pair are printed, and the program terminates.**
