Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. If `xs[x] >= (n - 1) >> 2`, then `memx` is updated to `[min(memx[0], x), max(memx[1], x)]` while `memy` retains its original value. Otherwise, `memx` and `memy` retain their original values.***
