The code initializes three variables: `a`, `memx`, and `memy`. 

- `a` is assigned the result of calling `rints_2d(n)`, which reads `n` lines from stdin and returns a list of lists of integers. Each inner list contains two integers representing coordinates `(x_i, y_i)`.
- `memx` is initialized to a list `[float('inf'), -1]`. This means `memx[0]` is set to positive infinity and `memx[1]` is set to -1.
- `memy` is also initialized to a list `[float('inf'), -1]`. This means `memy[0]` is set to positive infinity and `memy[1]` is set to -1.

The initial state remains unchanged except for these assignments.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer n (9 ≤ n ≤ 41) followed by 4n + 1 lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50). It is guaranteed that there are at least n/4 points on each side of an axis-aligned square, and all 4n + 1 points are distinct. `a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers read from stdin. `memx` is [float('inf'), -1]. `memy` is [float('inf'), -1].**
