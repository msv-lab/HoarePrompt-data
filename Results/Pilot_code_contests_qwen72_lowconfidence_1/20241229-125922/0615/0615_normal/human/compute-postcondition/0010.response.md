Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` lists where `n` must be greater than 0, each containing two integers read from stdin, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. If the count of the x-coordinate `x` in `xs` is greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`, then `memx` is `[x, x]` and `memy` remains `[float('inf'), -1]`. Otherwise, `memx` and `memy` retain their original values `[float('inf'), -1]`. The current value of `ys[y]` is greater than or equal to `(n - 1) // 4`.***
