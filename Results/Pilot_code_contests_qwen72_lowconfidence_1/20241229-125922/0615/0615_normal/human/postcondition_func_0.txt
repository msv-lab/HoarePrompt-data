The function processes input consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by 4n + 1 pairs of integer coordinates (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50). It identifies the smallest axis-aligned square that contains at least `n` points on each of its four sides. The function then checks each point to ensure it lies within this square. If a point does not satisfy the condition, the function prints the coordinates of that point and exits immediately. If all points satisfy the condition, the function completes without printing any values. The function assumes that the input is valid and that there are at least `n` points on each side of the square. Edge cases such as invalid input or fewer than `n` points on any side of the square are not handled by the function.
