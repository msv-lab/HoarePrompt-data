Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly identifies the point that is not on the boundary of the axis-aligned square, as required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works and why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the integer `n` which represents the number of points on each side of the square.
   - It then reads `4n + 1` lines of coordinates, storing them in the list `a`.

2. **Counting Coordinates**:
   - The program uses `Counter` objects to count the occurrences of each x-coordinate (`xs`) and y-coordinate (`ys`).
   - This helps in identifying the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that form the boundaries of the square.

3. **Identifying the Boundaries**:
   - The program iterates through the coordinates to determine the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that appear at least `n - 1` times (i.e., `n - 1 >> 2` which simplifies to `n - 1`).
   - These coordinates define the boundaries of the square.

4. **Finding the Outlier Point**:
   - The program then iterates through the coordinates again to find the point that does not lie on the boundary of the square.
   - A point is considered to be on the boundary if its x-coordinate is within the range `[memx[0], memx[1]]` and its y-coordinate is within the range `[memy[0], memy[1]]`.
   - If a point does not meet this condition, it is printed and the program exits.

### Why the Program is Correct:
- **Boundary Identification**: The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that form the boundaries of the square by using the `Counter` objects and the condition `xs[x] >= n - 1` and `ys[y] >= n - 1`.
- **Outlier Detection**: The program correctly identifies the point that does not lie on the boundary of the square by checking if the point's coordinates fall outside the identified boundary ranges.
- **Termination**: The program prints the outlier point and exits, ensuring that only one such point is printed, as required by the problem description.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Valid Input Assumption**: The program assumes that the input is valid and follows the constraints provided in the problem description. This means it does not handle invalid inputs such as non-integer coordinates or incorrect numbers of points, but this is acceptable according to the problem description.
- **Multiple Outliers**: The problem guarantees that there is exactly one point that is not on the boundary, so the program's logic of finding and printing the first such point is sufficient.

Given these points, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is therefore correct.
