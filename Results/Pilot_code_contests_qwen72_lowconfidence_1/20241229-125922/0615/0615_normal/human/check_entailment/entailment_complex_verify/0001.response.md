Final: **True**

Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of points `n` and the coordinates of the points into a list `a`. The annotated code confirms that `a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers.

2. **Counting X and Y Coordinates**:
   - The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each x-coordinate and y-coordinate. The annotated code confirms that `xs` and `ys` are `Counter` objects counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate and y-coordinate, respectively.

3. **Determining the Square Boundaries**:
   - The program iterates through the points and updates `memx` and `memy` to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that appear at least `n // 4` times. The annotated code confirms that `memx` and `memy` are updated correctly based on the condition `xs[x] >= (n - 1) >> 2` and `ys[y] >= (n - 1) >> 2`.

4. **Identifying the Outlier Point**:
   - The program iterates through the points again and checks if the point `(x, y)` is not on the boundary of the square defined by `memx` and `memy`. The annotated code confirms that the condition `(memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or (x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]))` is used to determine if a point is on the boundary.
   - If a point does not satisfy this condition, it prints the coordinates of the point and exits. The annotated code confirms that the program correctly prints the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary and exits.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, the program correctly identifies the point that is not on the boundary of the axis-aligned square. The original assessment of correctness is accurate, and the program meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the final assessment is **True**.
