Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment stated that the program correctly identifies the point that is not on the boundary of the square as described in the problem statement. The annotated version of the code provides additional detail and confirms the correctness of the program's logic.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of points `n` and then reads `4n + 1` points from the input. This matches the problem description.
   - The annotated version confirms that `a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers read from stdin.

2. **Counting X and Y Coordinates**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each x and y coordinate.
   - The annotated version confirms that `xs` and `ys` are `Counter` objects counting the occurrences of each x and y coordinate in the first and second columns of `a`, respectively.

3. **Determining the Boundaries**:
   - The program determines the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that appear at least `n - 1` times (which are the boundaries of the square).
   - The annotated version confirms that `memx` and `memy` are updated to contain the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that meet the condition `xs[x] >= (n - 1) >> 2` and `ys[y] >= (n - 1) >> 2`.

4. **Identifying the Outlier Point**:
   - The program iterates through all points and checks if a point lies outside the determined boundaries.
   - The annotated version confirms that the program checks the condition `(memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or (x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]))` for each point. If the condition is not satisfied, the point is printed and the program exits.

The annotated version of the code aligns with the original assessment and provides additional detail that supports the correctness of the program. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
