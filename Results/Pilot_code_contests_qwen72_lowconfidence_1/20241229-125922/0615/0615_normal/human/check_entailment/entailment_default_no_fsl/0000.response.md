Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program aims to identify the point that is not on the boundary of an axis-aligned square, given that all other points lie on the boundary of this square. However, there are a few issues with the logic that make the program incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Boundary Check**:
   - The code uses the condition `if not (memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or (x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]))` to check if a point is not on the boundary. This condition is not correct because it incorrectly handles the boundary conditions.
   - Specifically, the condition `y in memy` and `x in memx` are not appropriate for checking if a point lies on the boundary of the square. Instead, the correct condition should be to check if the point lies on one of the four sides of the square.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `memx` and `memy`**:
   - The code calculates `memx` and `memy` using the minimum and maximum values of `x` and `y` coordinates that appear at least `n-1 >> 2` times. This is not a reliable way to determine the boundaries of the square.
   - The correct approach would be to determine the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` values that define the square and then check if each point lies on one of the four sides of this square.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the points are not distributed uniformly around the square. For example, if the points are distributed such that the square is not aligned with the axes, the program will fail.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly identify the point that is not on the boundary of the square for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
