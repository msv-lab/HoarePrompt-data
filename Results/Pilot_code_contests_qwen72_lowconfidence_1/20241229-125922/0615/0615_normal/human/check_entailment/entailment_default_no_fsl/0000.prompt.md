You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Cybermen and the Daleks have long been the Doctor's main enemies. Everyone knows that both these species enjoy destroying everything they encounter. However, a little-known fact about them is that they both also love taking Turing tests!

Heidi designed a series of increasingly difficult tasks for them to spend their time on, which would allow the Doctor enough time to save innocent lives!

The funny part is that these tasks would be very easy for a human to solve.

The first task is as follows. There are some points on the plane. All but one of them are on the boundary of an axis-aligned square (its sides are parallel to the axes). Identify that point.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10).

Each of the following 4n + 1 lines contains two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50), describing the coordinates of the next point.

It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of the square and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.

Output

Print two integers — the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square.

Note

In both examples, the square has four sides x=0, x=2, y=0, y=2.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from collections import *

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    get_col = lambda arr, i: [row[i] for row in arr]
    n = int(input()) * 4 + 1
    (a, memx, memy) = (rints_2d(n), [float('inf'), -1], [float('inf'), -1])
    (xs, ys) = (Counter(get_col(a, 0)), Counter(get_col(a, 1)))
    for (x, y) in a:
        if xs[x] >= n - 1 >> 2:
            memx = [min(memx[0], x), max(memx[1], x)]
        if ys[y] >= n - 1 >> 2:
            memy = [min(memy[0], y), max(memy[1], y)]
    for (x, y) in a:
        if not (memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or (x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1])):
            print('%d %d' % (x, y))
            exit()


```
Output hints: The function processes input consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by 4n + 1 pairs of integer coordinates (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50). It identifies the smallest axis-aligned square that contains at least `n` points on each of its four sides. The function then checks each point to ensure it lies within this square. If a point does not satisfy the condition, the function prints the coordinates of that point and exits immediately. If all points satisfy the condition, the function completes without printing any values. The function assumes that the input is valid and that there are at least `n` points on each side of the square. Edge cases such as invalid input or fewer than `n` points on any side of the square are not handled by the function.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
