Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly handle the identification of the point that is not on the boundary of the square in all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to determine the boundaries of the square and to identify the outlier point is flawed.

1. **Boundary Calculation**: The code calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that are supposed to define the boundaries of the square. However, the condition `if xs[x] >= n - 1 >> 2` and `if ys[y] >= n - 1 >> 2` is incorrect. The expression `n - 1 >> 2` is equivalent to `(n - 1) // 4`, which is not the correct way to determine the threshold for the number of points on each side of the square. The correct threshold should be `n` (since there are at least `n` points on each side).

2. **Outlier Detection**: The logic for identifying the outlier point is also flawed. The condition `if not (memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or (x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]))` is too complex and does not accurately capture the requirement to find the point that is not on the boundary of the square. The correct condition should simply check if the point is not on any of the four sides of the square.

Given these issues, the program will fail to correctly identify the outlier point in many cases, making it incorrect.
