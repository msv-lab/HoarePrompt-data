Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly identifies the point that is not on the boundary of the square as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of points `n` and then reads `4n + 1` points from the input.

2. **Counting X and Y Coordinates**: It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each x and y coordinate.

3. **Determining the Boundaries**: It determines the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that appear at least `n-1` times (which are the boundaries of the square).

4. **Identifying the Outlier Point**: It iterates through all points and checks if a point lies outside the determined boundaries. If it does, that point is printed and the program exits.

The logic ensures that the point not on the boundary is correctly identified because:
- The boundaries are correctly determined by the most frequent x and y coordinates.
- The check ensures that the point lies outside these boundaries.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
