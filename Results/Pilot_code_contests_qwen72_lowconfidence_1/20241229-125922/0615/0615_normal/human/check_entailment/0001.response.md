Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly identify the point that is not on the boundary of the axis-aligned square. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of points `n` and then reads the coordinates of the points into a list `a`.

2. **Counting X and Y Coordinates**: It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each x-coordinate and y-coordinate.

3. **Determining the Square Boundaries**:
   - For each point `(x, y)`, it checks if the count of `x` is at least `n - 1 >> 2`. This is equivalent to checking if the count of `x` is at least `n // 4`.
   - It updates the minimum and maximum x-coordinates (`memx`) and y-coordinates (`memy`) that appear at least `n // 4` times.

4. **Identifying the Outlier Point**:
   - It iterates through the points again and checks if the point `(x, y)` is not on the boundary of the square defined by `memx` and `memy`.
   - A point is considered on the boundary if it satisfies either:
     - `memx[0] < x < memx[1]` and `y in memy`
     - `x in memx` and `memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]`
   - If a point does not satisfy these conditions, it prints the coordinates of the point and exits.

The logic ensures that the program correctly identifies the point that is not on the boundary of the square for all valid inputs. Given the constraints and the problem description, the program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
