You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Cybermen and the Daleks have long been the Doctor's main enemies. Everyone knows that both these species enjoy destroying everything they encounter. However, a little-known fact about them is that they both also love taking Turing tests!

Heidi designed a series of increasingly difficult tasks for them to spend their time on, which would allow the Doctor enough time to save innocent lives!

The funny part is that these tasks would be very easy for a human to solve.

The first task is as follows. There are some points on the plane. All but one of them are on the boundary of an axis-aligned square (its sides are parallel to the axes). Identify that point.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10).

Each of the following 4n + 1 lines contains two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50), describing the coordinates of the next point.

It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of the square and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.

Output

Print two integers — the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square.

Examples

Input


2
0 0
0 1
0 2
1 0
1 1
1 2
2 0
2 1
2 2


Output


1 1


Input


2
0 0
0 1
0 2
0 3
1 0
1 2
2 0
2 1
2 2


Output


0 3

Note

In both examples, the square has four sides x=0, x=2, y=0, y=2.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from collections import *

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    get_col = lambda arr, i: [row[i] for row in arr]
    n = int(input()) * 4 + 1
    (a, memx, memy) = (rints_2d(n), [float('inf'), -1], [float('inf'), -1])
    (xs, ys) = (Counter(get_col(a, 0)), Counter(get_col(a, 1)))
    for (x, y) in a:
        if xs[x] >= n - 1 >> 2:
            memx = [min(memx[0], x), max(memx[1], x)]
        if ys[y] >= n - 1 >> 2:
            memy = [min(memy[0], y), max(memy[1], y)]
    for (x, y) in a:
        if not (memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or (x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1])):
            print('%d %d' % (x, y))
            exit()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
