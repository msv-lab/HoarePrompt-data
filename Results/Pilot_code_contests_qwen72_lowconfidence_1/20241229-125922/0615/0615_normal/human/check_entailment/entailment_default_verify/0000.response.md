Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description, the program, and the output hints. Hereâ€™s a detailed justification:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and then reads `4n + 1` pairs of integer coordinates.
   - This aligns with the problem description and the output hints.

2. **Boundary Determination**:
   - The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each x and y coordinate.
   - It determines the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that appear at least `n-1` times, which are the boundaries of the square.
   - This logic is sound because the problem guarantees that there are at least `n` points on each side of the square.

3. **Outlier Identification**:
   - The program iterates through all points and checks if a point lies outside the determined boundaries.
   - If a point does not satisfy the condition, it prints the coordinates of that point and exits immediately.
   - This ensures that the point not on the boundary is correctly identified.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that the input is valid and that there are at least `n` points on each side of the square, which is consistent with the problem constraints.
   - The output hints confirm that the function processes valid input and handles the expected cases correctly.

Given the above points, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints support its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
