Final: **True**

Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of points `n` and then reads `4n + 1` points from the input. The input is parsed into a list of lists `a`, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinates of a point.

2. **Counting X and Y Coordinates**:
   - The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each x and y coordinate. This is essential for determining the boundaries of the square.

3. **Determining the Boundaries**:
   - The program calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that appear at least `n - 1 >> 2` times. This condition ensures that the boundaries of the square are correctly identified. The bitwise shift operation `n - 1 >> 2` is equivalent to `(n - 1) // 4`, which is appropriate given the problem constraints.

4. **Identifying the Outlier Point**:
   - The program iterates through all points and checks if a point lies outside the determined boundaries. If a point does not satisfy the condition `(memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or (x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]))`, it prints the coordinates of that point and exits.

5. **Annotations Verification**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes the input and updates the state variables `memx` and `memy` to represent the boundaries of the square.
   - The final loop correctly identifies and prints the point that does not lie on the boundary of the square.

Given the problem description and the annotations, the program's logic and implementation are sound. The annotations support the correctness of the program by verifying the state at different points and confirming that the program behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being correct is accurate.
