You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Cybermen and the Daleks have long been the Doctor's main enemies. Everyone knows that both these species enjoy destroying everything they encounter. However, a little-known fact about them is that they both also love taking Turing tests!

Heidi designed a series of increasingly difficult tasks for them to spend their time on, which would allow the Doctor enough time to save innocent lives!

The funny part is that these tasks would be very easy for a human to solve.

The first task is as follows. There are some points on the plane. All but one of them are on the boundary of an axis-aligned square (its sides are parallel to the axes). Identify that point.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10).

Each of the following 4n + 1 lines contains two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50), describing the coordinates of the next point.

It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of the square and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.

Output

Print two integers — the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square.

Note

In both examples, the square has four sides x=0, x=2, y=0, y=2.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from collections import *

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by 4n + 1 lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50). It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of an axis-aligned square, and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.
def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    get_col = lambda arr, i: [row[i] for row in arr]
    n = int(input()) * 4 + 1
    a, memx, memy = rints_2d(n), [float('inf'), -1], [float('inf'), -1]
    xs, ys = Counter(get_col(a, 0)), Counter(get_col(a, 1))
    for (x, y) in a:
        if xs[x] >= n - 1 >> 2:
            memx = [min(memx[0], x), max(memx[1], x)]
        
        if ys[y] >= n - 1 >> 2:
            memy = [min(memy[0], y), max(memy[1], y)]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers read from stdin. `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. `memx` is `[min(x for x in xs if xs[x] >= (n - 1) >> 2), max(x for x in xs if xs[x] >= (n - 1) >> 2)]` if there exists any x-coordinate in `xs` that meets the condition `xs[x] >= (n - 1) >> 2`; otherwise, `memx` remains `[float('inf'), -1]`. Similarly, `memy` is `[min(y for y in ys if ys[y] >= (n - 1) >> 2), max(y for y in ys if ys[y] >= (n - 1) >> 2)]` if there exists any y-coordinate in `ys` that meets the condition `ys[y] >= (n - 1) >> 2`; otherwise, `memy` remains `[float('inf'), -1]`.
    for (x, y) in a:
        if not (memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or x in memx and memy[0] <= y <=
            memy[1]):
            print('%d %d' % (x, y))
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers, where `n` is at least 1, `xs` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each x-coordinate in the first column of `a`, and `ys` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of each y-coordinate in the second column of `a`. `memx` and `memy` are calculated as described. After all iterations of the loop, if the condition `(memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or (x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1]))` is satisfied for every pair `(x, y)` in `a`, the program completes without printing any values. If the condition is not satisfied for any pair `(x, y)` in `a`, the values of `x` and `y` for that pair are printed, and the program terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by 4n + 1 pairs of integer coordinates (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50). It identifies the smallest axis-aligned square that contains at least `n` points on each of its four sides. The function then checks each point to ensure it lies within this square. If a point does not satisfy the condition, the function prints the coordinates of that point and exits immediately. If all points satisfy the condition, the function completes without printing any values. The function assumes that the input is valid and that there are at least `n` points on each side of the square. Edge cases such as invalid input or fewer than `n` points on any side of the square are not handled by the function.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
