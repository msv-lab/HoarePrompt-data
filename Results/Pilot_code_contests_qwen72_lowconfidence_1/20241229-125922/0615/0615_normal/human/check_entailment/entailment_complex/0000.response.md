Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `memx` and `memy`:**
   - The program uses the condition `if xs[x] >= n - 1 >> 2` to update `memx` and `memy`. However, this condition is not correctly identifying the boundaries of the square.
   - The expression `n - 1 >> 2` is equivalent to `(n - 1) // 4`, which is not necessarily the correct threshold for determining the minimum number of points on each side of the square. The problem states that there are at least `n` points on each side of the square, so the correct condition should be `if xs[x] >= n`.

2. **Incorrect Boundary Checking:**
   - The program checks if a point is inside the square using the condition `if not (memx[0] < x < memx[1] and y in memy or x in memx and memy[0] <= y <= memy[1])`. This condition is overly complex and may not correctly identify the point that is not on the boundary.
   - The correct condition should simply check if the point is not on the boundary of the square. A point is on the boundary if its x-coordinate or y-coordinate matches one of the boundaries of the square.

### Correct Approach:
- **Identify the Boundaries:**
  - Find the minimum and maximum x-coordinates (`min_x`, `max_x`) and y-coordinates (`min_y`, `max_y`) that appear at least `n` times.
- **Check Each Point:**
  - For each point, check if it lies on the boundary of the square defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y`.
  - If a point does not lie on the boundary, it is the point that is not on the boundary.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
from sys import stdin
from collections import Counter

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    
    n = int(input()) * 4 + 1
    a = rints_2d(n)
    
    xs = Counter([x for x, y in a])
    ys = Counter([y for x, y in a])
    
    min_x, max_x = float('inf'), -1
    min_y, max_y = float('inf'), -1
    
    for x in xs:
        if xs[x] >= n // 4:
            min_x = min(min_x, x)
            max_x = max(max_x, x)
    
    for y in ys:
        if ys[y] >= n // 4:
            min_y = min(min_y, y)
            max_y = max(max_y, y)
    
    for x, y in a:
        if not (x == min_x or x == max_x or y == min_y or y == max_y):
            print(f"{x} {y}")
            return

func()
```

This solution correctly identifies the boundaries of the square and checks each point to find the one that is not on the boundary. Therefore, the original program is incorrect because it does not accurately follow the problem description.
