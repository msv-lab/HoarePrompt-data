The function `func` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 105. It computes a sequence of values using a complex algorithm involving the `mex` (minimum excludant) function and cumulative XOR operations. After processing, the function prints either the smallest integer `k` such that `k * (k + 1) > 2 * n` and `xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0` for some valid `a`, or `-1` if no such `k` is found. The final state of the program includes the lists `spg` and `xor` of length `n + 1`, where `spg[i]` holds the result of the `mex` calculation for each `i` from 3 to `n`, and `xor[i]` holds the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index. The variable `i` is set to `n`, and `k` is the last value used in the final iteration of the loop. If `spg[n]` is false, the function prints `-1`.
