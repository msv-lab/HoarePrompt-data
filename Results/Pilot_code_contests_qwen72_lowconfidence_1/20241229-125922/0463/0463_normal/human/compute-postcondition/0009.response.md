The value of `a` is calculated as `s / 2 / k`. Given that `s` is 4 and `k` is 2, the calculation is `4 / 2 / 2`, which equals 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `k` is 2, `movs` is an empty set, `s` is 4, `a` is 1, and `s` is divisible by `2 * k`**
