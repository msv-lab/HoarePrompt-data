The function `func` is described to accept an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 105. However, the provided function signature does not include any parameters, which contradicts the given parameter constraints. Assuming the correct function signature should include the parameter `n`, here is the description:

The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 105. The provided output section is incomplete, so I cannot fully describe the return value without additional information. However, based on the typical structure, I will assume the function returns some value or performs an operation based on `n`.

Given the lack of specific output details, the most accurate description I can provide is:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 105 and returns a value or performs an operation based on `n`.**

If you can provide the specific output behavior, I can refine this description further.
