To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to evaluate the condition `k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i`.

Given the current state:
- `k` is 4
- `i` is 4

Let's calculate the condition:
- `k * (k + 1)` = 4 * (4 + 1) = 4 * 5 = 20
- `2 * i` = 2 * 4 = 8

The condition `20 <= 8` is false, so the loop will not execute another iteration with the current values of `k` and `i`.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i` becomes true.

Since `k` is 4, let's find the minimum value of `i` that satisfies the condition:
- We need `20 <= 2 * i`
- Dividing both sides by 2: `10 <= i`

Therefore, `i` must be at least 10 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 10, `k` is 4, `movs` contains {0}, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`, `s` is 2. If `s` is divisible by 4, `a` is \(\frac{1}{3}\). Otherwise, `a` remains undefined.**
