The value of `xor[i]` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `xor[i - 1]` and `mex`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, `mex` is 1, and `xor[3]` (which is `xor[i - 1]`) is 0. Therefore, `xor[4]` becomes `0 ^ 1`, which is 1.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 4, `k` is 3, `movs` contains [0], `mex` is 1.**
