The value of `spg[i]` is set to `mex`. We need to determine the value of `mex` based on the given conditions.

Given:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0.
- `i` is 4.
- `k` is the smallest integer such that \( k \cdot (k + 1) > 2 \cdot i \).
- `movs` contains the XOR of elements from `xor` based on the condition \( s \mod (2 \cdot k) == 0 \).
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `movs`.

First, let's determine `k`:
- \( i = 4 \)
- We need \( k \) such that \( k \cdot (k + 1) > 2 \cdot 4 = 8 \).
- The smallest integer \( k \) that satisfies this is \( k = 3 \) because \( 3 \cdot 4 = 12 > 8 \).

Next, let's determine `movs`:
- `movs` contains the XOR of elements from `xor` where \( s \mod (2 \cdot k) == 0 \).
- \( 2 \cdot k = 6 \)
- We need to check indices \( s \) where \( s \mod 6 == 0 \) within the range of `xor` (from 0 to `n` inclusive).

Since `i` is 4, the relevant indices for `movs` are those where \( s \mod 6 == 0 \) up to `i`:
- \( s = 0, 6 \) (since \( 6 \) is the next multiple of 6 after 0 and within the range of `i`).

Given `xor` is initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0:
- `xor[0] = 0`
- `xor[6]` does not exist since the length of `xor` is `int(n) + 1` and `n` is at least 3, so the maximum index is 4.

Thus, `movs` is:
- `movs = [0]` (only `xor[0]` is considered).

Finally, let's determine `mex`:
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `movs`.
- Since `movs = [0]`, the smallest non-negative integer not in `movs` is 1.

Therefore, `spg[i]` is set to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0, `i` is 4, `k` is 3, `movs` contains [0], `mex` is 1.**
