The value of `k` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 4, `k` is 3, `movs` contains {0}, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`, `s` is 6. If `s` is divisible by `2 * k` (which is 4), `a` is 1.5.**
