Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 5, `k` is 3, `movs` is a set containing 0, `mex` is 1, `s` is 4, and `a` is 2. If `s % (2 * k) == 0`, then the specific actions within the if part are executed. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as described in the precondition.***
