The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `mex` is 1, after the increment, `mex` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 5, `k` is 5, `movs` is a set containing 0 and 1, `mex` is 2**
