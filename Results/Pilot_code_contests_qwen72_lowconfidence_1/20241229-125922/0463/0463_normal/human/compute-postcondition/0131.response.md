The provided Python code snippet only contains a print statement. This statement prints `-1` to the console. Since this is a side effect (printing to the console) and does not modify any of the variables or data structures mentioned in the initial state, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the action of printing.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the result of the `mex` calculation for that iteration, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index, `i` is `n`, `k` is the last value of `k` used in the final iteration, `movs` is the set of all possible moves for the final iteration, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs` for the final iteration, and `spg[n]` is false. `-1` has been printed to the console.**
