The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `n`. Since the function `func` expects `n` to be an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 105, the user input should ideally be an integer within this range. However, `input()` returns a string, so `n` will initially be a string representation of the input.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take an integer n as input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 105, `n` is a string representing the user input.**
