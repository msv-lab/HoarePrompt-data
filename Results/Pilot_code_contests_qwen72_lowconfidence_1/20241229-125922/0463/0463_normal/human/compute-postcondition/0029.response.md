To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `mex in movs`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `mex` is an element of the list `movs`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `i` is 3.
- `k` is 3.
- `movs` contains 0.
- `mex` is 1.

Given this state, `mex` (which is 1) needs to be an element of `movs` for the loop to execute again. Currently, `movs` contains only 0, so `mex` (1) is not in `movs`. Therefore, the loop will not execute again unless `movs` is modified to include 1.

However, since the task is to modify the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `mex` is in `movs`.

State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `movs` contains 0 and 1, `mex` is 1**
