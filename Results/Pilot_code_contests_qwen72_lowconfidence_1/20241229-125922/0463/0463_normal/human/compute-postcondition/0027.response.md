To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to check the condition `mex in movs`. The loop will execute if `mex` is present in the list `movs`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `i` is 3.
- `k` is 3.
- `movs` contains the results of the XOR operations performed during the loop.
- `mex` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `mex` (which is 0) must be present in `movs`. However, since `movs` is initially empty (or at least we don't have information that it contains any elements), the condition `mex in movs` will be `False`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state so that `mex` (0) is in `movs`. Therefore, we need to add 0 to `movs`.

State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `movs` contains 0, `mex` is 0**
