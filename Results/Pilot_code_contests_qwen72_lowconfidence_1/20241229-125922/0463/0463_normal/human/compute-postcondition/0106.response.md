The value of `s` is calculated using the formula `2 * i - k * (k - 1)`. Given that `i` is `n`, `k` is 2, and `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, we substitute these values into the formula:

- `s = 2 * n - 2 * (2 - 1)`
- `s = 2 * n - 2 * 1`
- `s = 2 * n - 2`

Therefore, the value of `s` is `2 * n - 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the result of the `mex` calculation for that iteration, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index, `i` is `n`, `k` is 2, `movs` is the set of all possible moves for the final iteration, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs` for the final iteration, `spg[n]` is true, `s` is `2 * n - 2`**
