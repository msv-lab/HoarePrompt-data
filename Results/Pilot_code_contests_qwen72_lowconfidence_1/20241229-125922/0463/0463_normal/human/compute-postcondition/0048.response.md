The value of `a` is updated to `s / 2 / k`. Given that `s` is 2 and `k` is 3, the calculation is:

\[ a = \frac{2}{2} \div 3 = 1 \div 3 = \frac{1}{3} \]

Therefore, the new value of `a` is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 4, `k` is 3, `movs` contains {0}, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`, `s` is 2, `a` is \(\frac{1}{3}\)**
