The given code snippet is:
```python
movs.add(xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1])
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code step by step:

1. **Identify the current values of relevant variables:**
   - `a` is 1
   - `k` is 4
   - `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`
   - `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`
   - `movs` contains {0}

2. **Calculate the indices for the `xor` list:**
   - `a + k - 1` = 1 + 4 - 1 = 4
   - `a - 1` = 1 - 1 = 0

3. **Access the values in the `xor` list:**
   - `xor[4]` = 0 (since `xor` is initialized with zeros)
   - `xor[0]` = 0 (since `xor` is initialized with zeros)

4. **Compute the XOR operation:**
   - `xor[4] ^ xor[0]` = 0 ^ 0 = 0

5. **Update the `movs` set:**
   - `movs.add(0)` does not change `movs` because 0 is already in `movs`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 10, `k` is 4, `movs` contains {0}, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`, `s` is 8, `a` is 1.**
