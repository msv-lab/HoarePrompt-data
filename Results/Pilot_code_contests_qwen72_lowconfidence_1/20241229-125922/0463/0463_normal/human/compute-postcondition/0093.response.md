To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to focus on the condition `mex in movs`. The loop will execute if `mex` is in the set `movs`.

Given the program state:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1.
- `i` is 5.
- `k` is 5.
- `movs` is a set containing 0.
- `mex` is 0.

The key variable here is `mex`, which is currently 0. The set `movs` contains 0, so `mex in movs` evaluates to `True`. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments.

State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 5, `k` is 5, `movs` is a set containing 0, `mex` is 0**
