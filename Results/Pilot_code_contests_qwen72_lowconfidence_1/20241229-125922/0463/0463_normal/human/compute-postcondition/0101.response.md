The code snippet `xor[i] = xor[i - 1] ^ mex` updates the value of `xor[i]` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `xor[i - 1]` and `mex`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0, `spg[4]` which is 1, and `spg[5]` which is 3.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1.
- `i` is 5.
- `k` is 5.
- `movs` is a set containing all integers from 0 up to `mex - 1`.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `movs`.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `i` is 5, so `xor[5]` will be updated.
2. `xor[i - 1]` is `xor[4]`, which is 1.
3. `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `movs`. Since `movs` contains all integers from 0 up to `mex - 1`, `mex` is the next integer after the highest value in `movs`.

Assuming `movs` is initially empty (as no specific values are provided), `mex` would be 0. However, since `movs` is described as containing all integers from 0 up to `mex - 1`, let's assume `mex` is 1 (the smallest non-negative integer not in `movs`).

Thus:
- `xor[5] = xor[4] ^ mex = 1 ^ 1 = 0`.

The updated state is:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0, `spg[4]` which is 1, and `spg[5]` which is 3.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0, `xor[4]` which is 1, and `xor[5]` which is 0.
- `i` is 5.
- `k` is 5.
- `movs` is a set containing all integers from 0 up to `mex - 1`.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `movs`.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0, `spg[4]` which is 1, and `spg[5]` which is 3, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0, `xor[4]` which is 1, and `xor[5]` which is 0, `i` is 5, `k` is 5, `movs` is a set containing all integers from 0 up to `mex - 1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `movs`.**
