The code snippet updates the value of `s` using the formula \( s = 2 \times i - k \times (k - 1) \).

Given:
- `i` is 10
- `k` is 4

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ s = 2 \times 10 - 4 \times (4 - 1) \]
\[ s = 20 - 4 \times 3 \]
\[ s = 20 - 12 \]
\[ s = 8 \]

Since `s` is now 8, which is not divisible by 4, the variable `a` remains undefined.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 10, `k` is 4, `movs` contains {0}, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`, `s` is 8, `a` remains undefined.**
