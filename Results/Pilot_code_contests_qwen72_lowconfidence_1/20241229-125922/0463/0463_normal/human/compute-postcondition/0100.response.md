The code snippet assigns the value of `mex` to `spg[i]`. Given that `i` is 5, `spg[5]` will be updated to the value of `mex`.

From the initial state:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1.
- `i` is 5.
- `k` is 5.
- `movs` is a set containing all integers from 0 up to `mex - 1`.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `movs`.

Since `movs` contains all integers from 0 up to `mex - 1`, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `movs`, if `movs` is `{0, 1, 2}`, then `mex` would be 3. Therefore, `spg[5]` is set to 3.

The output state includes all the initial conditions that remain unchanged, with the updated value of `spg[5]`.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0, `spg[4]` which is 1, and `spg[5]` which is 3, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 5, `k` is 5, `movs` is a set containing all integers from 0 up to `mex - 1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `movs`**.
