The provided Python code initializes the variable `mex` to 0. This operation does not affect the other variables in the initial state.

- `n` remains a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` remains a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `xor` remains a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `i` remains 3.
- `k` remains 3.
- `movs` continues to contain the results of the XOR operations performed during the loop.
- `mex` is now 0.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `movs` contains the results of the XOR operations performed during the loop, `mex` is 0**
