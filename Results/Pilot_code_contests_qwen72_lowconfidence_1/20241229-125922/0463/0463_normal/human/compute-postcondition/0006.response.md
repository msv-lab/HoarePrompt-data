To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to evaluate the condition `k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i` with the given initial state.

Given:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `i` is 3.
- `k` is 2.
- `movs` is an empty set.

Let's evaluate the condition:
- `k` is 2.
- `k + 1` is 3.
- `k * (k + 1)` is `2 * 3` which equals 6.
- `2 * i` is `2 * 3` which equals 6.

The condition `k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i` evaluates to `6 <= 6`, which is true. Therefore, the loop can execute at least once with the current state.

Since the condition is already satisfied, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `k` is 2, `movs` is an empty set**
