Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 4, `k` is 2, `movs` is an empty set, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`, `s` is 6, and `s` is divisible by `2 * k` (which is 4)***
