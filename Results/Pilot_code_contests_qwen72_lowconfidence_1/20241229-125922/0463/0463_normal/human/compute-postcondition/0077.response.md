Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 5, `k` is 2, `movs` is a set containing 0 if `s` is divisible by 4, otherwise `movs` remains an empty set, `mex` is 1, `s` is 8, and `a` is 2 if `s` is divisible by 4.***
