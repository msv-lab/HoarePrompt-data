The code increments the value of `mex` by 1. The previous value of `mex` was 0, so the new value of `mex` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `movs` contains 0, `mex` is 1**
