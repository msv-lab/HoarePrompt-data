To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1.
- `i` is 4.
- `k` is 3.
- `movs` contains [0].
- `mex` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 5.
4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`spg`, `xor`, `k`, `movs`, `mex`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they remain the same.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 4 to 5.
- All other variables remain the same.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 5, `k` is 3, `movs` contains [0], `mex` is 1.**
