The value of `k` is updated from 3 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 4, `k` is 2, `movs` contains all integers from 0 up to and including `mex - 1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`.**
