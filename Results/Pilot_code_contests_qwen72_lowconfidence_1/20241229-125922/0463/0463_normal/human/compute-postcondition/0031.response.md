To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `mex in movs`.

Given the current state:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros
- `i` is 3
- `k` is 3
- `movs` contains 0 and 1
- `mex` is 2

The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `mex` (which is 2) must be in the list `movs`. Currently, `movs` contains only 0 and 1, so `mex` (2) is not in `movs`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `mex` must be added to `movs`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to include `mex` in `movs`.

State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `movs` contains 0, 1, and 2, `mex` is 2**
