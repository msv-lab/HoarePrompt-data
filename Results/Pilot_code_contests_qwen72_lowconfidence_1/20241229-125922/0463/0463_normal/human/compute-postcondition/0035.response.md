The code snippet `xor[i] = xor[i - 1] ^ mex` modifies the `xor` list by setting the element at index `i` to the result of the XOR operation between the element at index `i - 1` and `mex`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `i` is 3.
- `k` is 3.
- `movs` contains all integers from 0 up to and including `mex - 1`.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The value of `xor[i - 1]` is `xor[2]`, which is 0 (since `xor` is initialized with zeros).
2. The value of `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`. Since `movs` contains all integers from 0 up to and including `mex - 1`, `mex` is the next integer after the largest value in `movs`.
3. The XOR operation `0 ^ mex` results in `mex` because any number XORed with 0 is the number itself.

Therefore, the value of `xor[3]` is set to `mex`.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `movs` contains all integers from 0 up to and including `mex - 1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`.**
