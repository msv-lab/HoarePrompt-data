To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and initial conditions:

1. **Variable `n`**: The variable `n` is a string representing user input. For the loop `for i in range(3, n + 1)` to execute, `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 3. This is because the range function expects an integer and the loop will only run if the upper bound (n + 1) is greater than the lower bound (3).

2. **List `spg`**: The list `spg` is initialized with zeros and has a length of `int(n) + 1`. This initialization is dependent on `n` being a valid integer.

3. **List `xor`**: Similarly, the list `xor` is initialized with zeros and has a length of `int(n) + 1`.

4. **Index `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 3.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `n` is a valid integer and that it is at least 3 for the loop to execute. Additionally, the lists `spg` and `xor` should be properly initialized based on the value of `n`.

### Adjusted State
- **`n` must be a valid integer greater than or equal to 3**: This ensures the loop can start and iterate.
- **`spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros**: This is already given and correct.
- **`xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros**: This is also already given and correct.
- **`i` is 3**: This is the starting point of the loop.

### Final State
State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3**
