The code initializes a list `spg` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The value of `n` is a string representing the user input, but it will be converted to an integer when creating the list.

Output State: **`n` is a string representing the user input, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros.**
