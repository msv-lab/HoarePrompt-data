`a` is calculated as `s / 2 / k`. Given the initial conditions, `s` is `2 * n - 6`, and `k` is 3. Substituting these values:

- `s = 2 * n - 6`
- `a = (2 * n - 6) / 2 / 3 = (n - 3) / 3`

Therefore, `a` is now equal to \((n - 3) / 3\).

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the result of the `mex` calculation for that iteration, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index, `i` is `n`, `k` is 3, `movs` is the set of all possible moves for the final iteration, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs` for the final iteration, `spg[n]` is true, `s` is `2 * n - 6`, `a` is \((n - 3) / 3\)**.
