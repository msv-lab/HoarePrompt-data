To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1`.
   - `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `k` is 2.
   - `movs` is the set of all possible moves for the final iteration.
   - `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs` for the final iteration.
   - `spg[n]` is true.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i`.

3. **Substitute Initial Values:**
   - `k = 2`
   - `i = n`
   - Therefore, the condition becomes: `2 * (2 + 1) <= 2 * n`
   - Simplify: `6 <= 2 * n`
   - Divide both sides by 2: `3 <= n`

4. **Check Initial Condition:**
   - Given that `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, the condition `3 <= n` is already satisfied.

### Conclusion:
Since the condition `3 <= n` is already satisfied by the initial state (`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3), no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the result of the `mex` calculation for that iteration, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index, `i` is `n`, `k` is 2, `movs` is the set of all possible moves for the final iteration, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs` for the final iteration, and `spg[n]` is true**
