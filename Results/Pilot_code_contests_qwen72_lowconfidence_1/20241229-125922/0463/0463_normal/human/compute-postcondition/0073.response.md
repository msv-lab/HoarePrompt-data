The code snippet calculates the value of `s` using the formula `2 * i - k * (k - 1)`. Let's evaluate this step by step:

- `i` is 5
- `k` is 2

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ s = 2 * 5 - 2 * (2 - 1) \]
\[ s = 10 - 2 * 1 \]
\[ s = 10 - 2 \]
\[ s = 8 \]

So, `s` is assigned the value 8. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 5, `k` is 2, `movs` is an empty set, `mex` is 1, `s` is 8**
