`s` is calculated using the formula `2 * i - k * (k - 1)`. Given that `i` is 4 and `k` is 2, the calculation is `2 * 4 - 2 * (2 - 1)`, which simplifies to `8 - 2`, resulting in `6`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 4, `k` is 2, `movs` is an empty set, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`, `s` is 6.
