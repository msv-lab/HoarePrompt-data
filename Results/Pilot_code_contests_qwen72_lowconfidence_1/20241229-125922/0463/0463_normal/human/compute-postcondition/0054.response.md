The code snippet updates the value of `a` using the formula \( a = \frac{s}{2 \times k} \).

Given:
- `s` is 8
- `k` is 4

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ a = \frac{8}{2 \times 4} \]
\[ a = \frac{8}{8} \]
\[ a = 1 \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 10, `k` is 4, `movs` contains {0}, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`, `s` is 8, `a` is 1.**
