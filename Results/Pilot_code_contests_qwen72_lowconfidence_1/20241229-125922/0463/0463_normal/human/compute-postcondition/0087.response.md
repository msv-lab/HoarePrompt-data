`a` is assigned the value of `s / 2 / k`. Given that `s` is -2 and `k` is 4, the calculation is `-2 / 2 / 4`, which results in `-0.25`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 5, `k` is 4, `movs` is a set containing 0, `mex` is 1, `s` is -2, `a` is -0.25**
