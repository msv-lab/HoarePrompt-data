To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, and `xor[3]` is `mex`.
- `i` is 3.
- `k` is 3.
- `movs` contains all integers from 0 up to and including `mex - 1`.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
2. **Next Iteration of `i`**: In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 4.
3. **Condition Check**: The loop will execute again if `i` (which is now 4) is less than or equal to `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 3 to 4.
- `n` remains a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- The other variables (`spg`, `xor`, `k`, `movs`, and `mex`) remain unchanged because the problem does not specify any changes to them within the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 4, `k` is 3, `movs` contains all integers from 0 up to and including `mex - 1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`.**
