The code snippet adds the result of the expression `xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1]` to the set `movs`. Let's evaluate this step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is a valid integer ≥ 3
   - `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1
   - `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1
   - `i` is 5
   - `k` is 3
   - `movs` is a set containing 0
   - `mex` is 1
   - `s` is 4
   - `a` is approximately 0.6667 (which we can round to 0.6667 for calculation purposes)

2. **Expression Calculation:**
   - `a + k - 1` = 0.6667 + 3 - 1 = 2.6667 (rounded to 3)
   - `xor[a + k - 1]` = `xor[3]` = 0
   - `a - 1` = 0.6667 - 1 = -0.3333 (rounded to 0)
   - `xor[a - 1]` = `xor[0]` = 0
   - `xor[3] ^ xor[0]` = 0 ^ 0 = 0

3. **Update `movs`:**
   - `movs.add(0)`

Since `movs` already contains 0, adding 0 again does not change the set.

**Output State:**
**`n` is a valid integer ≥ 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 5, `k` is 3, `movs` is a set containing 0, `mex` is 1, `s` is 4, and `a` is approximately 0.6667**
