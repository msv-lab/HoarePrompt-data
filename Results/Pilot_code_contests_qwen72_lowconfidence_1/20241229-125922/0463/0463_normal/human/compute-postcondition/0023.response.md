Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 10, `k` is 4, `movs` is `{0}`, `s` is 8. If `s % (2 * k) == 0`, `a` is `0.25`. Otherwise, `a` remains `1`.***
