The value of `k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `movs` is an empty set if `s` is not divisible by `2 * k`, otherwise `movs` is `{0}`, `s` is 4, and `a` is 1.**
