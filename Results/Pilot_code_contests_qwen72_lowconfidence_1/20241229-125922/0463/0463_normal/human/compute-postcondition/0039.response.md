To determine whether the loop can execute at least once, we need to evaluate the condition `k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i`.

Given the state:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor[3]` is `mex`
- `i` is 4
- `k` is 2
- `movs` is an empty set
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`

Let's evaluate the loop condition:
- `k * (k + 1) = 2 * (2 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`
- `2 * i = 2 * 4 = 8`

The condition `k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i` becomes `6 <= 8`, which is true.

Since the condition is already true, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 4, `k` is 2, `movs` is an empty set, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`**
