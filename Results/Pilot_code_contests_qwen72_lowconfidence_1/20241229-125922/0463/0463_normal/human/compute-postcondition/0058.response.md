Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 4, `k` is the smallest integer such that \( k \cdot (k + 1) > 2 \cdot i \), `movs` contains the XOR of elements from `xor` based on the condition \( s \mod (2 \cdot k) == 0 \), `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`.**
