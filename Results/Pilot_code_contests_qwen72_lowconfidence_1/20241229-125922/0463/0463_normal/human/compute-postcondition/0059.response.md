The value of `mex` is set to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` is 0, `i` is 4, `k` is the smallest integer such that \( k \cdot (k + 1) > 2 \cdot i \), `movs` contains the XOR of elements from `xor` based on the condition \( s \mod (2 \cdot k) == 0 \), `mex` is 0.**
