The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` was 2, so the new value of `k` is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 5, `k` is 3, `movs` is a set containing 0, `mex` is 1, `s` is 8, and `a` is 2.**
