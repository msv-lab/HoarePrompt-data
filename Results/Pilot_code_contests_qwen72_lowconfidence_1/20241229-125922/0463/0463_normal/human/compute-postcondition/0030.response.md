`mex` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `movs` contains 0 and 1, `mex` is 2.
