The code `spg[i] = mex` assigns the value of `mex` to the element at index `i` in the list `spg`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`.

Since `movs` contains all integers from 0 up to and including `mex - 1`, `mex` is the next integer after the maximum value in `movs`. For example, if `movs` contains [0, 1, 2], then `mex` would be 3.

Therefore, the element at index 3 in the list `spg` is updated to `mex`.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `movs` contains all integers from 0 up to and including `mex - 1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`.**
