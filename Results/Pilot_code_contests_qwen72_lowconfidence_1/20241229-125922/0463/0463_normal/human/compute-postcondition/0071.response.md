The code snippet `movs = set()` initializes `movs` as an empty set, overriding the previous value of `movs` which was a list containing `[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 5, `k` is 2, `movs` is an empty set, `mex` is 1.**
