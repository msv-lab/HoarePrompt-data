Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the result of the `mex` calculation for that iteration, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index, `i` is `n`, `k` is 2, `movs` is the set of all possible moves for the final iteration, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs` for the final iteration, `spg[n]` is true, `s` is `2 * n - 2`. If `s` is divisible by 4, `a` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\). If `(xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1])` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
