The value of `s` is updated based on the formula `2 * i - k * (k - 1)`. Given the initial values of `i` as 10 and `k` as 4:

- `2 * i` evaluates to `2 * 10 = 20`.
- `k * (k - 1)` evaluates to `4 * (4 - 1) = 4 * 3 = 12`.

Thus, `s` becomes `20 - 12 = 8`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 10, `k` is 4, `movs` is `{0}`, `s` is 8, and `a` is 1.**
