The code snippet `movs.add(xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1])` performs the following actions:

1. **Calculate `a + k - 1`:**
   - Given `a` is 1.5 and `k` is 2, the expression `a + k - 1` evaluates to `1.5 + 2 - 1 = 2.5`.

2. **Convert `2.5` to an integer index:**
   - Since `xor` is a list, indices must be integers. The value `2.5` will be converted to an integer, which is `2`.

3. **Calculate `a - 1`:**
   - Given `a` is 1.5, the expression `a - 1` evaluates to `1.5 - 1 = 0.5`.

4. **Convert `0.5` to an integer index:**
   - Similarly, the value `0.5` will be converted to an integer, which is `0`.

5. **Access `xor` at indices 2 and 0:**
   - `xor[2]` is 0 (since `xor` is initialized with zeros).
   - `xor[0]` is 0 (since `xor` is initialized with zeros).

6. **Compute the XOR operation:**
   - `xor[2] ^ xor[0]` evaluates to `0 ^ 0 = 0`.

7. **Add the result to `movs`:**
   - `movs.add(0)` adds the integer `0` to the set `movs`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`.
- `i` is 4.
- `k` is 2.
- `movs` is an empty set.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`.
- `s` is 6.
- `s` is divisible by `2 * k` (which is 4).
- `a` is 1.5.

After executing the code, the only change is that `0` is added to the set `movs`.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 4, `k` is 2, `movs` contains {0}, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`, `s` is 6, `s` is divisible by `2 * k` (which is 4), `a` is 1.5.**
