To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition `while mex in movs:`. The loop will execute if `mex` is found in the list `movs`.

Given the state:
- `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0.
- `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0.
- `i` is 4.
- `k` is the smallest integer such that \( k \cdot (k + 1) > 2 \cdot i \).
- `movs` contains the XOR of elements from `xor` based on the condition \( s \mod (2 \cdot k) == 0 \).
- `mex` is 0.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate `k`:**
   - Given `i = 4`, we need \( k \cdot (k + 1) > 8 \).
   - The smallest integer \( k \) that satisfies this is \( k = 3 \) because \( 3 \cdot 4 = 12 > 8 \).

2. **Determine `movs`:**
   - `movs` contains the XOR of elements from `xor` where \( s \mod (2 \cdot k) == 0 \).
   - Here, \( k = 3 \), so \( 2 \cdot k = 6 \).
   - We need to find indices \( s \) in `xor` such that \( s \mod 6 == 0 \).
   - Since `xor` is initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0, the only index that could satisfy \( s \mod 6 == 0 \) within the range of `xor` (which is 0 to `n`) is 0 (as 0 mod 6 is 0).
   - Therefore, `movs` will contain `xor[0]` which is 0.

3. **Check the loop condition:**
   - The loop condition is `while mex in movs`.
   - `mex` is 0.
   - `movs` contains 0.

Since `mex` (which is 0) is in `movs` (which contains 0), the loop condition `while mex in movs` is true, and the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0, `i` is 4, `k` is the smallest integer such that \( k \cdot (k + 1) > 2 \cdot i \), `movs` contains the XOR of elements from `xor` based on the condition \( s \mod (2 \cdot k) == 0 \), `mex` is 0**
