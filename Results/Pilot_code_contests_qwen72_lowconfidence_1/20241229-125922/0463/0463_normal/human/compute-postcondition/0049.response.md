To solve this, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
movs.add(xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1])
```

1. **Identify the variables and their initial values:**
   - `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`.
   - `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `k` is 3.
   - `movs` contains `{0}`.
   - `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`.
   - `s` is 2.
   - `a` is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

2. **Calculate the expression inside the `add` method:**
   - `a + k - 1`:
     - `a` is \(\frac{1}{3}\).
     - `k` is 3.
     - `a + k - 1` = \(\frac{1}{3} + 3 - 1\) = \(\frac{1}{3} + 2\) = \(\frac{7}{3}\).
   - Since `a + k - 1` is not an integer, we need to consider the integer part (floor value) of \(\frac{7}{3}\), which is 2.
   - `xor[a + k - 1]`:
     - `xor[2]` is 0 (since `xor` is initialized with zeros except `xor[3]`).
   - `a - 1`:
     - `a` is \(\frac{1}{3}\).
     - `a - 1` = \(\frac{1}{3} - 1\) = \(-\frac{2}{3}\).
   - Since `a - 1` is not an integer, we need to consider the integer part (floor value) of \(-\frac{2}{3}\), which is -1.
   - However, negative indices are not valid for the `xor` list, so we need to consider the closest valid index, which is 0.
   - `xor[a - 1]`:
     - `xor[0]` is 0 (since `xor` is initialized with zeros).

3. **Perform the XOR operation:**
   - `xor[2] ^ xor[0]` = 0 ^ 0 = 0.

4. **Update the `movs` set:**
   - `movs.add(0)`: Since `movs` already contains `{0}`, adding 0 again does not change the set.

5. **Final Output State:**
   - `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`.
   - `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `k` is 3.
   - `movs` contains `{0}`.
   - `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`.
   - `s` is 2.
   - `a` is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 4, `k` is 3, `movs` contains `{0}`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`, `s` is 2, `a` is \(\frac{1}{3}\)**.
