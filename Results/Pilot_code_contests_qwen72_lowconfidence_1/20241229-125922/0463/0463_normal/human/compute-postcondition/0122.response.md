The code snippet updates the value of `s` using the formula `2 * i - k * (k - 1)`. Given the initial state, let's calculate the new value of `s`:

- `i` is `n`.
- `k` is 4.

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[ s = 2 * n - 4 * (4 - 1) \]
\[ s = 2 * n - 4 * 3 \]
\[ s = 2 * n - 12 \]

Since `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, the new value of `s` is:
\[ s = 2 * n - 12 \]

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the result of the `mex` calculation for that iteration, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index, `i` is `n`, `k` is 4, `movs` is the set of all possible moves for the final iteration, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs` for the final iteration, `spg[n]` is true, `s` is `2 * n - 12`. If `s` is divisible by 6, `a` is \((n - 3) / 3\). If `xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s` is not divisible by 6, the program continues without breaking.**
