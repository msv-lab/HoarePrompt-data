Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1.
   - `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1.
   - `i` is 5.
   - `k` is 4.
   - `movs` is a set containing 0.
   - `mex` is 1.
   - `s` is -2.
   - `a` is -0.25.

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   movs.add(xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Impact:**
   - Calculate `a + k - 1`:
     - `a` is -0.25.
     - `k` is 4.
     - `a + k - 1` = -0.25 + 4 - 1 = 2.75.
   - Since `a + k - 1` is 2.75, we need to access `xor[2.75]`. However, `xor` is a list, and lists in Python only accept integer indices. Therefore, this operation is invalid and will raise an error.

Since the operation is invalid and will raise an error, the state of the program does not change. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is 0 and `spg[4]` which is 1, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `xor[3]` which is 0 and `xor[4]` which is 1, `i` is 5, `k` is 4, `movs` is a set containing 0, `mex` is 1, `s` is -2, `a` is -0.25**.
