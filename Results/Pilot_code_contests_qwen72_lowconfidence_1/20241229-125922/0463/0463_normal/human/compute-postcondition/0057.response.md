The value of `k` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros except `spg[3]` which is `mex`, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, except `xor[3]` is `mex`, `i` is 10, `k` is 5, `movs` contains {0}, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs`, `s` is 8. If `s` is divisible by `2 * k`, `a` is 1 and `movs` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` remains undefined.**
