The code snippet `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

- `k` was initially 3, so after incrementing, `k` becomes 4.
- The value of `n` remains a valid integer greater than or equal to 3.
- The list `spg` remains a list of length `int(n) + 1` with the same properties.
- The list `xor` remains a list of length `int(n) + 1` with the same properties.
- The variable `i` remains `n`.
- The set `movs` remains the set of all possible moves for the final iteration.
- The variable `mex` remains the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs` for the final iteration.
- The value `spg[n]` remains true.
- The variable `s` remains `2 * n - 6`.
- If `s` is divisible by 6, `a` remains \((n - 3) / 3\).
- If `s` is not divisible by 6, the program continues without breaking.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the result of the `mex` calculation for that iteration, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index, `i` is `n`, `k` is 4, `movs` is the set of all possible moves for the final iteration, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs` for the final iteration, `spg[n]` is true, `s` is `2 * n - 6`. If `s` is divisible by 6, `a` is \((n - 3) / 3\). If `xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s` is not divisible by 6, the program continues without breaking.**
