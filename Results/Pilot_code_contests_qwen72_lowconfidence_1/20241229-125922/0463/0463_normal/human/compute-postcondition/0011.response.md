Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `k` is 2, `movs` is an empty set, `s` is 4. If `s` is divisible by `2 * k`, `movs` is `{0}`, and `a` is 1.***
