Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 105. It computes a sequence of values using a complex algorithm involving the `mex` (minimum excludant) function and cumulative XOR operations. After processing, the function prints either the smallest integer `k` such that `k * (k + 1) > 2 * n` and `xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0` for some valid `a`, or `-1` if no such `k` is found. The final state of the program includes the lists `spg` and `xor` of length `n + 1`, where `spg[i]` holds the result of the `mex` calculation for each `i` from 3 to `n`, and `xor[i]` holds the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index. The variable `i` is set to `n`, and `k` is the last value used in the final iteration of the loop. If `spg[n]` is false, the function prints `-1`. **

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Input Validation:** The function does not validate the input `n` to ensure it is within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). If `n` is outside this range, the behavior is undefined.
- **Edge Case for Small `n`:** The function assumes `n` is at least 3, but it does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is 1 or 2. For `n < 3`, the function might produce unexpected results or errors.
- **Floating Point Division:** The division operation `a = s / 2 / k` uses floating-point arithmetic. This could lead to precision issues, although the context suggests that `s` and `k` are chosen to ensure `a` is an integer.
- **Output Handling:** The function prints the result directly to the console rather than returning it. This limits its reusability in other contexts where the result might need to be processed further.
