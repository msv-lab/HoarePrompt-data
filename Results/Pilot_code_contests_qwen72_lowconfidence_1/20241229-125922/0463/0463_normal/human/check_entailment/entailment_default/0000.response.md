Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case as described in the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` reads input using `input()`, which returns a string. However, the problem description specifies that the input is an integer. The program should convert the input to an integer using `int(input())` to ensure it works correctly with numerical inputs.

2. **Variable Scope and Reuse**: The variable `i` is used both in the main loop and in the final check, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs. The final check should use a different variable name to avoid overwriting the loop variable.

3. **Final Check Logic**: The final check to determine the minimum `k` value is not correctly implemented. The loop in the final check should use `n` instead of `i` to ensure it is checking the correct value.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, when `n` is 1 or 2, the program should immediately return `-1` because no valid moves can be made. However, the current implementation does not account for these small values of `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n < 3:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    spg = [0] * (n + 1)
    xor = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        k = 2
        movs = set()
        while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i:
            s = 2 * i - k * (k - 1)
            if s % (2 * k) == 0:
                a = s // (2 * k)
                movs.add(xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1])
            k += 1
        mex = 0
        while mex in movs:
            mex += 1
        spg[i] = mex
        xor[i] = xor[i - 1] ^ mex
    
    if spg[n]:
        k = 2
        while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * n:
            s = 2 * n - k * (k - 1)
            if s % (2 * k) == 0:
                a = s // (2 * k)
                if xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0:
                    print(k)
                    return
            k += 1
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This corrected version handles the input conversion, edge cases, and variable scope issues, ensuring that the program works correctly for every potential case as described in the problem statement.
