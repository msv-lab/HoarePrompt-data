Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully adhere to the problem description in several key aspects. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of why it is incorrect:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` reads the input using `input()`, but it does not convert the input to an integer. This can lead to issues if the input is not properly handled.
   - The correct way to read the input and convert it to an integer is `n = int(input())`.

2. **Initialization and Loop**:
   - The program initializes lists `spg` and `xor` with `n + 1` elements, which is correct.
   - The loop starts from `3` to `n`, which is also correct because the game rules apply for `n >= 3`.

3. **Move Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the possible moves by iterating over `k` and checking the conditions.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the case where no valid move is found. Specifically, the loop that calculates `movs` and `mex` should ensure that all possible moves are considered and that the `mex` value is correctly computed.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if `spg[n]` is non-zero to determine if Serozha wins. This is correct.
   - However, the second loop to find the minimal `k` such that Serozha can split the pile is not correctly implemented. The loop should break when a valid `k` is found, but it does not handle the case where no valid `k` is found.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimal `k` if Serozha wins, which is correct.
   - If Serozha does not win, the program prints `-1`, which is also correct.

### Specific Issues:
- **Input Conversion**: The input should be converted to an integer.
- **Move Calculation**: The loop to find the minimal `k` should handle the case where no valid `k` is found.
- **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases, such as when `n` is very small (e.g., `n = 3`), to ensure it behaves as expected.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues mentioned:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    spg = [0] * (n + 1)
    xor = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        k = 2
        movs = set()
        
        while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i:
            s = 2 * i - k * (k - 1)
            if s % (2 * k) == 0:
                a = s // (2 * k)
                movs.add(xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1])
            k += 1
        
        mex = 0
        while mex in movs:
            mex += 1
        
        spg[i] = mex
        xor[i] = xor[i - 1] ^ mex
    
    if spg[n]:
        k = 2
        while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * n:
            s = 2 * n - k * (k - 1)
            if s % (2 * k) == 0:
                a = s // (2 * k)
                if xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0:
                    print(k)
                    return
            k += 1
        print(-1)  # This should not happen if the above logic is correct
    else:
        print(-1)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly handle all aspects of the problem description, particularly in input conversion and move calculation. The corrected program ensures that the input is properly handled and that the minimal `k` is correctly calculated and printed. Therefore, the original program is **incorrect**.
