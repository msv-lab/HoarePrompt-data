You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two best friends Serozha and Gena play a game.

Initially there is one pile consisting of n stones on the table. During one move one pile should be taken and divided into an arbitrary number of piles consisting of a1 > a2 > ... > ak > 0 stones. The piles should meet the condition a1 - a2 = a2 - a3 = ... = ak - 1 - ak = 1. Naturally, the number of piles k should be no less than two.

The friends play in turns. The player who cannot make a move loses. Serozha makes the first move. Who will win if both players play in the optimal way?

Input

The single line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

Output

If Serozha wins, print k, which represents the minimal number of piles into which he can split the initial one during the first move in order to win the game.

If Gena wins, print "-1" (without the quotes).

Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    spg = [0] * (n + 1)
    xor = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        k = 2
        movs = set()
        while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i:
            s = 2 * i - k * (k - 1)
            if s % (2 * k) == 0:
                a = s / 2 / k
                movs.add(xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1])
            k += 1
        mex = 0
        while mex in movs:
            mex += 1
        spg[i] = mex
        xor[i] = xor[i - 1] ^ mex
    if spg[n]:
        k = 2
        while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i:
            s = 2 * i - k * (k - 1)
            if s % (2 * k) == 0:
                a = s / 2 / k
                if xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0:
                    break
            k += 1
        print(k)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has an issue with the variable `i` in the second loop where it attempts to find the minimal number of piles. The variable `i` is not defined in this scope, and it should be `n` instead. This will cause the program to fail to execute correctly for some inputs.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
if spg[n]:
    k = 2
    while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i:  # This should be 2 * n
        s = 2 * i - k * (k - 1)  # This should be 2 * n - k * (k - 1)
        if s % (2 * k) == 0:
            a = s / 2 / k
            if xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0:
                break
        k += 1
    print(k)
else:
    print(-1)
```

This mistake will lead to incorrect behavior for certain inputs, making the program incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 105. It computes a sequence of values using a complex algorithm involving the `mex` (minimum excludant) function and cumulative XOR operations. After processing, the function prints either the smallest integer `k` such that `k * (k + 1) > 2 * n` and `xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0` for some valid `a`, or `-1` if no such `k` is found. The final state of the program includes the lists `spg` and `xor` of length `n + 1`, where `spg[i]` holds the result of the `mex` calculation for each `i` from 3 to `n`, and `xor[i]` holds the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index. The variable `i` is set to `n`, and `k` is the last value used in the final iteration of the loop. If `spg[n]` is false, the function prints `-1`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
