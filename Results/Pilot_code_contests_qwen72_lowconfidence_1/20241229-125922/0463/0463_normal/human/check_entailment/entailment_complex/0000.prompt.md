You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Two best friends Serozha and Gena play a game.

Initially there is one pile consisting of n stones on the table. During one move one pile should be taken and divided into an arbitrary number of piles consisting of a1 > a2 > ... > ak > 0 stones. The piles should meet the condition a1 - a2 = a2 - a3 = ... = ak - 1 - ak = 1. Naturally, the number of piles k should be no less than two.

The friends play in turns. The player who cannot make a move loses. Serozha makes the first move. Who will win if both players play in the optimal way?

Input

The single line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

Output

If Serozha wins, print k, which represents the minimal number of piles into which he can split the initial one during the first move in order to win the game.

If Gena wins, print "-1" (without the quotes).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take an integer n as input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 105.
def func():
    n = input()
    spg = [0] * (n + 1)
    xor = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        k = 2
        
        movs = set()
        
        while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i:
            s = 2 * i - k * (k - 1)
            if s % (2 * k) == 0:
                a = s / 2 / k
                movs.add(xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1])
            k += 1
        
        mex = 0
        
        while mex in movs:
            mex += 1
        
        spg[i] = mex
        
        xor[i] = xor[i - 1] ^ mex
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the result of the `mex` calculation for that iteration, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index, `i` is `n`, `k` is the last value of `k` used in the final iteration, `movs` is the set of all possible moves for the final iteration, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs` for the final iteration.
    if spg[n] :
        k = 2
        while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i:
            s = 2 * i - k * (k - 1)
            
            if s % (2 * k) == 0:
                a = s / 2 / k
                if xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0:
                    break
            
            k += 1
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the result of the `mex` calculation for that iteration, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index, `i` is `n`, `k` is such that `k * (k + 1) > 2 * i`, `movs` is the set of all possible moves for the final iteration, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs` for the final iteration, `spg[n]` is true. If the loop did not break early due to the condition `xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0`, `k` will be the smallest integer such that `k * (k + 1) > 2 * i`.
        print(k)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 3, `spg` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the result of the `mex` calculation for that iteration, `xor` is a list of length `int(n) + 1` where each element from index 3 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index, `i` is `n`, `k` is the last value of `k` used in the final iteration, `movs` is the set of all possible moves for the final iteration, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `movs` for the final iteration. If `spg[n]` is true, `k` is printed, and `k` is such that `k * (k + 1) > 2 * i`. If `spg[n]` is false, `-1` is printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 105. It computes a sequence of values using a complex algorithm involving the `mex` (minimum excludant) function and cumulative XOR operations. After processing, the function prints either the smallest integer `k` such that `k * (k + 1) > 2 * n` and `xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0` for some valid `a`, or `-1` if no such `k` is found. The final state of the program includes the lists `spg` and `xor` of length `n + 1`, where `spg[i]` holds the result of the `mex` calculation for each `i` from 3 to `n`, and `xor[i]` holds the cumulative XOR of the `mex` values up to that index. The variable `i` is set to `n`, and `k` is the last value used in the final iteration of the loop. If `spg[n]` is false, the function prints `-1`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
