Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has an issue with the variable `i` in the second loop where it attempts to find the minimal number of piles. The variable `i` is not defined in this scope, and it should be `n` instead. This will cause the program to fail to execute correctly for some inputs.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
if spg[n]:
    k = 2
    while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i:  # This should be 2 * n
        s = 2 * i - k * (k - 1)  # This should be 2 * n - k * (k - 1)
        if s % (2 * k) == 0:
            a = s / 2 / k
            if xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0:
                break
        k += 1
    print(k)
else:
    print(-1)
```

This mistake will lead to incorrect behavior for certain inputs, making the program incorrect.
