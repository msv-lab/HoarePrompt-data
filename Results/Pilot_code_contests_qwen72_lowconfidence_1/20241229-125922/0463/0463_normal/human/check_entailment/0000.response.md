Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the second part of the loop where it tries to find the minimal number of piles `k` such that the XOR of the Grundy numbers from `a` to `a + k - 1` is zero. The variable `i` used in this loop is not defined in this context; instead, `n` should be used. This leads to incorrect behavior when the program tries to calculate the minimal `k`.

Here's the problematic section of the code:
```python
if spg[n]:
    k = 2
    while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * i:  # Incorrect usage of 'i' here
        s = 2 * i - k * (k - 1)  # Incorrect usage of 'i' here
        if s % (2 * k) == 0:
            a = s / 2 / k
            if xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0:
                break
        k += 1
    print(k)
else:
    print(-1)
```

The correct version should use `n` instead of `i`:
```python
if spg[n]:
    k = 2
    while k * (k + 1) <= 2 * n:  # Correct usage of 'n'
        s = 2 * n - k * (k - 1)  # Correct usage of 'n'
        if s % (2 * k) == 0:
            a = s // (2 * k)  # Use integer division
            if xor[a + k - 1] ^ xor[a - 1] == 0:
                break
        k += 1
    print(k)
else:
    print(-1)
```

This correction ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimal number of piles `k` for the given `n`. Without this correction, the program will fail to produce the correct output for certain values of `n`.
