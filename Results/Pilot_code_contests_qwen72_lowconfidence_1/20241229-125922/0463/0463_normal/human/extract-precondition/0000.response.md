Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take an integer n as input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 105.** However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. To match the problem description, the function definition should be updated to accept an integer parameter `n`. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(n):
```

With this correction, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 105.**
