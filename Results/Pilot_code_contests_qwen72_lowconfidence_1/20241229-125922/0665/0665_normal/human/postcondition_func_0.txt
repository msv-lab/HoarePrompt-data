The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It writes the contents of the `buffer` object to the standard output using `sys.__stdout__.write(buffer.getvalue())`. The function assumes that `buffer` is an instance of a writable buffer or stream-like object that has a `getvalue` method. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the content of `buffer` is printed to the standard output, and the `buffer` itself remains unchanged unless further operations are performed on it. The function does not modify any input parameters or have any side effects beyond writing to the standard output.
