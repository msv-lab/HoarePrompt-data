#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    sys.__stdout__.write(buffer.getvalue())
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It writes the contents of the `buffer` object to the standard output using `sys.__stdout__.write(buffer.getvalue())`. The function assumes that `buffer` is an instance of a writable buffer or stream-like object that has a `getvalue` method. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the content of `buffer` is printed to the standard output, and the `buffer` itself remains unchanged unless further operations are performed on it. The function does not modify any input parameters or have any side effects beyond writing to the standard output.
