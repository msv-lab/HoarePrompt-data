The function `func_1` does not explicitly show its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints, it should accept two parameters: `n` and `a`. Here, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

Since the output description is not provided, I will assume the function returns some value based on the input parameters. However, without specific details about the output, I cannot definitively state what the function returns. For the purpose of this task, I will describe the parameters and leave the output as a general placeholder.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a value based on the input parameters.**
