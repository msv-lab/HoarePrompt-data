You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's call a list of positive integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} a power sequence if there is a positive integer c, so that for every 0 ≤ i ≤ n-1 then a_i = c^i.

Given a list of n positive integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}, you are allowed to:

  * Reorder the list (i.e. pick a permutation p of \{0,1,...,n - 1\} and change a_i to a_{p_i}), then 
  * Do the following operation any number of times: pick an index i and change a_i to a_i - 1 or a_i + 1 (i.e. increment or decrement a_i by 1) with a cost of 1. 



Find the minimum cost to transform a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} into a power sequence.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print the minimum cost to transform a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} into a power sequence.

Note

In the first example, we first reorder \{1, 3, 2\} into \{1, 2, 3\}, then increment a_2 to 4 with cost 1 to get a power sequence \{1, 2, 4\}.
Program:
```
import atexit, io, sys
import math

buffer = io.BytesIO()
sys.stdout = buffer
n = int(raw_input())
l = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
l.sort()
mx = l[n - 1]
x = math.log(mx, 2)
c = pow(2, x / (n - 1))
floor_c = int(c)
if floor_c <= 0:
    floor_c += 1
nxt_num = floor_c + 1
ans = pow(10, 16)
res = 0
mul = 1
c = floor_c
for i in range(0, n):
    res += abs(mul - l[i])
    mul = mul * c
ans = min(ans, res)
res2 = 0
mul = 1
c = nxt_num
for i in range(0, n):
    res2 += abs(mul - l[i])
    mul = mul * c
ans = min(ans, res2)
print(int(ans))

    sys.__stdout__.write(buffer.getvalue())

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by considering only two possible values for `c`: the floor value of the calculated `c` and the next integer value. However, this approach may miss the optimal solution for certain inputs. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
2 4 8
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- The input list is already a power sequence with `c = 2`.
- The program calculates `c` and considers both `floor_c` and `nxt_num`. However, it fails to recognize that the input list is already a valid power sequence and incorrectly computes a non-zero cost.

This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to an incorrect result for this specific input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import atexit, io, sys
import math

buffer = io.BytesIO()
sys.stdout = buffer
n = int(raw_input())
l = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
l.sort()
mx = l[n - 1]
x = math.log(mx, 2)
c = pow(2, x / (n - 1))
floor_c = int(c)
if floor_c <= 0:
    floor_c += 1
nxt_num = floor_c + 1
ans = pow(10, 16)
res = 0
mul = 1
c = floor_c
for i in range(0, n):
    res += abs(mul - l[i])
    mul = mul * c
ans = min(ans, res)
res2 = 0
mul = 1
c = nxt_num
for i in range(0, n):
    res2 += abs(mul - l[i])
    mul = mul * c
ans = min(ans, res2)
print(int(ans))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    sys.__stdout__.write(buffer.getvalue())


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
