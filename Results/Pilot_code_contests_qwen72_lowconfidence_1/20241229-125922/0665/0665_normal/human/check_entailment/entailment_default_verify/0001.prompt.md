You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's call a list of positive integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} a power sequence if there is a positive integer c, so that for every 0 ≤ i ≤ n-1 then a_i = c^i.

Given a list of n positive integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}, you are allowed to:

  * Reorder the list (i.e. pick a permutation p of \{0,1,...,n - 1\} and change a_i to a_{p_i}), then 
  * Do the following operation any number of times: pick an index i and change a_i to a_i - 1 or a_i + 1 (i.e. increment or decrement a_i by 1) with a cost of 1. 



Find the minimum cost to transform a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} into a power sequence.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print the minimum cost to transform a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} into a power sequence.

Note

In the first example, we first reorder \{1, 3, 2\} into \{1, 2, 3\}, then increment a_2 to 4 with cost 1 to get a power sequence \{1, 2, 4\}.
Program:
```
import atexit, io, sys
import math

buffer = io.BytesIO()
sys.stdout = buffer
n = int(raw_input())
l = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
l.sort()
mx = l[n - 1]
x = math.log(mx, 2)
c = pow(2, x / (n - 1))
floor_c = int(c)
if floor_c <= 0:
    floor_c += 1
nxt_num = floor_c + 1
ans = pow(10, 16)
res = 0
mul = 1
c = floor_c
for i in range(0, n):
    res += abs(mul - l[i])
    mul = mul * c
ans = min(ans, res)
res2 = 0
mul = 1
c = nxt_num
for i in range(0, n):
    res2 += abs(mul - l[i])
    mul = mul * c
ans = min(ans, res2)
print(int(ans))

def func_1():
    sys.__stdout__.write(buffer.getvalue())


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by considering only two possible values for `c`: the floor value of the calculated `c` and the next integer value. However, this approach may miss the optimal solution for certain inputs. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
2 4 8
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- The input list is already a power sequence with `c = 2`.
- The program calculates `c` and considers both `floor_c` and `nxt_num`. However, it fails to recognize that the input list is already a valid power sequence and incorrectly computes a non-zero cost.

This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to an incorrect result for this specific input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It writes the contents of the `buffer` object to the standard output using `sys.__stdout__.write(buffer.getvalue())`. The function assumes that `buffer` is an instance of a writable buffer or stream-like object that has a `getvalue` method. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the content of `buffer` is printed to the standard output, and the `buffer` itself remains unchanged unless further operations are performed on it. The function does not modify any input parameters or have any side effects beyond writing to the standard output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
