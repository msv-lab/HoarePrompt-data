You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Let's call a list of positive integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} a power sequence if there is a positive integer c, so that for every 0 ≤ i ≤ n-1 then a_i = c^i.

Given a list of n positive integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}, you are allowed to:

  * Reorder the list (i.e. pick a permutation p of \{0,1,...,n - 1\} and change a_i to a_{p_i}), then 
  * Do the following operation any number of times: pick an index i and change a_i to a_i - 1 or a_i + 1 (i.e. increment or decrement a_i by 1) with a cost of 1. 



Find the minimum cost to transform a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} into a power sequence.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print the minimum cost to transform a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} into a power sequence.

Note

In the first example, we first reorder \{1, 3, 2\} into \{1, 2, 3\}, then increment a_2 to 4 with cost 1 to get a power sequence \{1, 2, 4\}.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import atexit, io, sys
import math

buffer = io.BytesIO()
sys.stdout = buffer
n = int(raw_input())
l = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
l.sort()
mx = l[n - 1]
x = math.log(mx, 2)
c = pow(2, x / (n - 1))
floor_c = int(c)
if floor_c <= 0:
    floor_c += 1
nxt_num = floor_c + 1
ans = pow(10, 16)
res = 0
mul = 1
c = floor_c
for i in range(0, n):
    res += abs(mul - l[i])
    mul = mul * c
ans = min(ans, res)
res2 = 0
mul = 1
c = nxt_num
for i in range(0, n):
    res2 += abs(mul - l[i])
    mul = mul * c
ans = min(ans, res2)
print(int(ans))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    sys.__stdout__.write(buffer.getvalue())

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
