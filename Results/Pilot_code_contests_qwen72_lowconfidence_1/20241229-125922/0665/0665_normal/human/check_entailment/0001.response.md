Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by considering only two possible values for `c`: the floor value of the calculated `c` and the next integer value. However, this approach may miss the optimal solution for certain inputs. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
2 4 8
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- The input list is already a power sequence with `c = 2`.
- The program calculates `c` and considers both `floor_c` and `nxt_num`. However, it fails to recognize that the input list is already a valid power sequence and incorrectly computes a non-zero cost.

This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to an incorrect result for this specific input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
