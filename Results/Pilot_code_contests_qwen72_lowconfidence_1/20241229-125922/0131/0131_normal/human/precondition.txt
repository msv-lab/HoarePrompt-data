t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 4⋅10^5, representing the number of participants. The list p of length n contains non-negative integers (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^6) in non-increasing order, where p_i represents the number of problems solved by the i-th participant. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
