You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: So the Beautiful Regional Contest (BeRC) has come to an end! n students took part in the contest. The final standings are already known: the participant in the i-th place solved p_i problems. Since the participants are primarily sorted by the number of solved problems, then p_1 ≥ p_2 ≥ ... ≥ p_n.

Help the jury distribute the gold, silver and bronze medals. Let their numbers be g, s and b, respectively. Here is a list of requirements from the rules, which all must be satisfied:

  * for each of the three types of medals, at least one medal must be awarded (that is, g>0, s>0 and b>0); 
  * the number of gold medals must be strictly less than the number of silver and the number of bronze (that is, g<s and g<b, but there are no requirements between s and b); 
  * each gold medalist must solve strictly more problems than any awarded with a silver medal; 
  * each silver medalist must solve strictly more problems than any awarded a bronze medal; 
  * each bronze medalist must solve strictly more problems than any participant not awarded a medal; 
  * the total number of medalists g+s+b should not exceed half of all participants (for example, if n=21, then you can award a maximum of 10 participants, and if n=26, then you can award a maximum of 13 participants). 



The jury wants to reward with medals the total maximal number participants (i.e. to maximize g+s+b) so that all of the items listed above are fulfilled. Help the jury find such a way to award medals.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of a test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 4⋅10^5) — the number of BeRC participants. The second line of a test case contains integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^6), where p_i is equal to the number of problems solved by the i-th participant from the final standings. The values p_i are sorted in non-increasing order, i.e. p_1 ≥ p_2 ≥ ... ≥ p_n.

The sum of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 4⋅10^5.

Output

Print t lines, the j-th line should contain the answer to the j-th test case.

The answer consists of three non-negative integers g, s, b.

  * Print g=s=b=0 if there is no way to reward participants with medals so that all requirements from the statement are satisfied at the same time. 
  * Otherwise, print three positive numbers g, s, b — the possible number of gold, silver and bronze medals, respectively. The sum of g+s+b should be the maximum possible. If there are several answers, print any of them.

Note

In the first test case, it is possible to reward 1 gold, 2 silver and 3 bronze medals. In this case, the participant solved 5 tasks will be rewarded with the gold medal, participants solved 4 tasks will be rewarded with silver medals, participants solved 2 or 3 tasks will be rewarded with bronze medals. Participants solved exactly 1 task won't be rewarded. It's easy to see, that in this case, all conditions are satisfied and it is possible to reward participants in this way. It is impossible to give more than 6 medals because the number of medals should not exceed half of the number of participants. The answer 1, 3, 2 is also correct in this test case.

In the second and third test cases, it is impossible to reward medals, because at least one medal of each type should be given, but the number of medals should not exceed half of the number of participants.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the number of gold medals is strictly less than the number of silver and bronze medals, and it does not correctly handle cases where the total number of medalists exceeds half the number of participants.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

**Input:**
```
1
10
5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1 3 3
```

**Explanation:**
- The program outputs `1 3 3`, which means 1 gold medal, 3 silver medals, and 3 bronze medals.
- However, this output is incorrect because the number of gold medals (1) is not strictly less than the number of silver medals (3) and the number of bronze medals (3). According to the problem statement, the number of gold medals must be strictly less than both the number of silver and bronze medals.
- The correct output should be `1 2 3` or any other valid combination that satisfies all the conditions.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly enforce the condition `g < s` and `g < b`, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prints a series of values to a specified stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separating them with a specified separator (defaulting to a space), and appending a specified end character (defaulting to a newline). It also optionally flushes the stream if the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `'sep'`, `'file'`, and `'end'` during its execution. If `'flush'` is present and `True`, it is also removed after flushing the stream. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include: if `args` is empty, nothing is written to the stream except the `end` character; if `file` is not writable, an error may occur; if `flush` is `True` but the stream does not support flushing, an error may occur.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
