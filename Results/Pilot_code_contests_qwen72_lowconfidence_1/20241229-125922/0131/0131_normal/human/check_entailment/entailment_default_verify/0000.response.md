Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the program. The program fails to correctly handle the distribution of medals in certain scenarios, specifically failing to enforce the condition that the number of gold medals (g) must be strictly less than the number of silver (s) and bronze (b) medals. Additionally, the program does not always ensure that the total number of medalists (g + s + b) does not exceed half of all participants. The provided example case clearly demonstrates this issue, where the program outputs `1 3 2` instead of the expected `1 2 2`, violating the condition that g < s and g < b. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
