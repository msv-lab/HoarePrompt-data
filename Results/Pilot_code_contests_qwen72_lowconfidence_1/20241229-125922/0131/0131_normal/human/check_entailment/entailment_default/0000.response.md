Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals (`g`, `s`, `b`) satisfies the condition that the total number of medalists should not exceed half of all participants (`g + s + b <= n // 2`). Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the requirement that each type of medal must be awarded at least once (`g > 0`, `s > 0`, `b > 0`).

### Issues Identified:
1. **Medal Distribution Logic**:
   - The program does not correctly distribute the medals to ensure that the number of gold medals is strictly less than the number of silver and bronze medals (`g < s` and `g < b`).
   - The logic for assigning medals is flawed. For example, if the number of participants is small, the program may not assign any medals at all, even if it is possible to do so.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the number of participants is very small (e.g., `n = 1` or `n = 2`). In these cases, it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, but the program should return `0 0 0` instead of attempting to assign medals incorrectly.
   - The program does not handle cases where the number of participants is large and the distribution of solved problems makes it difficult to assign medals correctly.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  12
  5 4 4 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  1 2 3
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  - The program may not correctly assign the medals, especially if the distribution of solved problems is not handled properly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
