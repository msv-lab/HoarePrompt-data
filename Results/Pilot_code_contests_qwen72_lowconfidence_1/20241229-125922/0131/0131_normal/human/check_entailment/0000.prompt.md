You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: So the Beautiful Regional Contest (BeRC) has come to an end! n students took part in the contest. The final standings are already known: the participant in the i-th place solved p_i problems. Since the participants are primarily sorted by the number of solved problems, then p_1 ≥ p_2 ≥ ... ≥ p_n.

Help the jury distribute the gold, silver and bronze medals. Let their numbers be g, s and b, respectively. Here is a list of requirements from the rules, which all must be satisfied:

  * for each of the three types of medals, at least one medal must be awarded (that is, g>0, s>0 and b>0); 
  * the number of gold medals must be strictly less than the number of silver and the number of bronze (that is, g<s and g<b, but there are no requirements between s and b); 
  * each gold medalist must solve strictly more problems than any awarded with a silver medal; 
  * each silver medalist must solve strictly more problems than any awarded a bronze medal; 
  * each bronze medalist must solve strictly more problems than any participant not awarded a medal; 
  * the total number of medalists g+s+b should not exceed half of all participants (for example, if n=21, then you can award a maximum of 10 participants, and if n=26, then you can award a maximum of 13 participants). 



The jury wants to reward with medals the total maximal number participants (i.e. to maximize g+s+b) so that all of the items listed above are fulfilled. Help the jury find such a way to award medals.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of a test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 4⋅10^5) — the number of BeRC participants. The second line of a test case contains integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^6), where p_i is equal to the number of problems solved by the i-th participant from the final standings. The values p_i are sorted in non-increasing order, i.e. p_1 ≥ p_2 ≥ ... ≥ p_n.

The sum of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 4⋅10^5.

Output

Print t lines, the j-th line should contain the answer to the j-th test case.

The answer consists of three non-negative integers g, s, b.

  * Print g=s=b=0 if there is no way to reward participants with medals so that all requirements from the statement are satisfied at the same time. 
  * Otherwise, print three positive numbers g, s, b — the possible number of gold, silver and bronze medals, respectively. The sum of g+s+b should be the maximum possible. If there are several answers, print any of them.

Note

In the first test case, it is possible to reward 1 gold, 2 silver and 3 bronze medals. In this case, the participant solved 5 tasks will be rewarded with the gold medal, participants solved 4 tasks will be rewarded with silver medals, participants solved 2 or 3 tasks will be rewarded with bronze medals. Participants solved exactly 1 task won't be rewarded. It's easy to see, that in this case, all conditions are satisfied and it is possible to reward participants in this way. It is impossible to give more than 6 medals because the number of medals should not exceed half of the number of participants. The answer 1, 3, 2 is also correct in this test case.

In the second and third test cases, it is impossible to reward medals, because at least one medal of each type should be given, but the number of medals should not exceed half of the number of participants.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
