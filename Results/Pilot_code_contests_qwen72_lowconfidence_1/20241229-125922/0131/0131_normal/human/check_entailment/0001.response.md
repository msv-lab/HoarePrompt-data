Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the number of gold medals is strictly less than the number of silver and bronze medals, and it does not correctly handle cases where the total number of medalists exceeds half the number of participants.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

**Input:**
```
1
10
5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1 3 3
```

**Explanation:**
- The program outputs `1 3 3`, which means 1 gold medal, 3 silver medals, and 3 bronze medals.
- However, this output is incorrect because the number of gold medals (1) is not strictly less than the number of silver medals (3) and the number of bronze medals (3). According to the problem statement, the number of gold medals must be strictly less than both the number of silver and bronze medals.
- The correct output should be `1 2 3` or any other valid combination that satisfies all the conditions.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly enforce the condition `g < s` and `g < b`, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
