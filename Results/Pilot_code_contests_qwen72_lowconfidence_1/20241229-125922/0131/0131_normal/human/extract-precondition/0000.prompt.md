You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: So the Beautiful Regional Contest (BeRC) has come to an end! n students took part in the contest. The final standings are already known: the participant in the i-th place solved p_i problems. Since the participants are primarily sorted by the number of solved problems, then p_1 ≥ p_2 ≥ ... ≥ p_n.

Help the jury distribute the gold, silver and bronze medals. Let their numbers be g, s and b, respectively. Here is a list of requirements from the rules, which all must be satisfied:

  * for each of the three types of medals, at least one medal must be awarded (that is, g>0, s>0 and b>0); 
  * the number of gold medals must be strictly less than the number of silver and the number of bronze (that is, g<s and g<b, but there are no requirements between s and b); 
  * each gold medalist must solve strictly more problems than any awarded with a silver medal; 
  * each silver medalist must solve strictly more problems than any awarded a bronze medal; 
  * each bronze medalist must solve strictly more problems than any participant not awarded a medal; 
  * the total number of medalists g+s+b should not exceed half of all participants (for example, if n=21, then you can award a maximum of 10 participants, and if n=26, then you can award a maximum of 13 participants). 



The jury wants to reward with medals the total maximal number participants (i.e. to maximize g+s+b) so that all of the items listed above are fulfilled. Help the jury find such a way to award medals.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of a test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 4⋅10^5) — the number of BeRC participants. The second line of a test case contains integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^6), where p_i is equal to the number of problems solved by the i-th participant from the final standings. The values p_i are sorted in non-increasing order, i.e. p_1 ≥ p_2 ≥ ... ≥ p_n.

The sum of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 4⋅10^5.

Output

Print t lines, the j-th line should contain the answer to the j-th test case.

The answer consists of three non-negative integers g, s, b.

  * Print g=s=b=0 if there is no way to reward participants with medals so that all requirements from the statement are satisfied at the same time. 
  * Otherwise, print three positive numbers g, s, b — the possible number of gold, silver and bronze medals, respectively. The sum of g+s+b should be the maximum possible. If there are several answers, print any of them.

Note

In the first test case, it is possible to reward 1 gold, 2 silver and 3 bronze medals. In this case, the participant solved 5 tasks will be rewarded with the gold medal, participants solved 4 tasks will be rewarded with silver medals, participants solved 2 or 3 tasks will be rewarded with bronze medals. Participants solved exactly 1 task won't be rewarded. It's easy to see, that in this case, all conditions are satisfied and it is possible to reward participants in this way. It is impossible to give more than 6 medals because the number of medals should not exceed half of the number of participants. The answer 1, 3, 2 is also correct in this test case.

In the second and third test cases, it is impossible to reward medals, because at least one medal of each type should be given, but the number of medals should not exceed half of the number of participants.
