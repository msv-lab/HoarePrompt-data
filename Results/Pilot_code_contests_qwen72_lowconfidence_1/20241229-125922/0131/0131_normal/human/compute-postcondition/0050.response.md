The provided code snippet is a function call `func_2(0, 0, 0)`. Without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact behavior of the function or what it returns. However, based on the initial state provided, we can infer the following:

- The function `func_2` is called with arguments `(0, 0, 0)`.
- Since no additional information about `func_2` is provided, we cannot determine if it modifies any of the variables in the initial state or if it returns a value.

Given that the function call itself does not provide enough information to change the state of the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `g` is the number of distinct integers encountered up to the midpoint of the input, `s` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of the same integer (up to the midpoint) where the sequence count is less than or equal to `g`, `b` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of the same integer (up to the midpoint) where the sequence count is greater than `g`, `l` is the length of the last sequence of the same integer (up to the midpoint), `p` is the last integer encountered (up to the midpoint), `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to the midpoint), `j` is the last integer processed (up to the midpoint). If `n` is 0 or the input is empty, the loop does not execute, and `g`, `s`, `b`, `l`, `p`, `i`, and `j` retain their initial values. Additionally, either `g` is 0, or `s` is 0, or `b` is 0, or `g` is greater than or equal to `s`, or `g` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
