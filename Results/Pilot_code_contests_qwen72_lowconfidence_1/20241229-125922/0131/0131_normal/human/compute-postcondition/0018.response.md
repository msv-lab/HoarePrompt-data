The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged based on their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` is a tuple containing at least one argument of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is a string equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is a stream object equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, the string representation of `x` has been written to `file`, `x` is the next element in `args`, `at_start` is `False`.
