The value of `at_start` is set to `False`. The other variables (`args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`) remain unchanged. The string representation of `x` has already been written to `file`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least one argument of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is a string equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is a stream object equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False`, and the string representation of `x` has been written to `file`.**
