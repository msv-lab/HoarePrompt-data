The function call `func_2(g, s, b)` indicates that the function `func_2` is called with the arguments `g`, `s`, and `b`. Since the body of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. However, based on the initial state and the given conditions, we can infer the following:

- The function `func_2` is called with the current values of `g`, `s`, and `b`.
- If `func_2` modifies any of these variables, those changes would be reflected in the output state.
- If `func_2` returns a value, it should be mentioned in the output state.

Since the function body is not provided, we assume that the function does not modify the global variables and does not return any value. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `g` is the number of distinct integers encountered up to the midpoint of the input, `s` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of the same integer (up to the midpoint) where the sequence count is less than or equal to `g`, `b` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of the same integer (up to the midpoint) where the sequence count is greater than `g`, `l` is the length of the last sequence of the same integer (up to the midpoint), `p` is the last integer encountered (up to the midpoint), `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to the midpoint), `j` is the last integer processed (up to the midpoint). If `n` is 0 or the input is empty, the loop does not execute, and `g`, `s`, `b`, `l`, `p`, `i`, and `j` retain their initial values. Additionally, `g > 0`, `s > 0`, `b > 0`, `g < s`, and `g < b`.**
