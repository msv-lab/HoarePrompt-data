The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters from the provided signature. However, based on the context, it's implied that the function reads or processes input that includes a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing a positive integer `n` (the number of participants) and then `n` space-separated integers representing the number of problems solved by each participant in non-increasing order. The function processes this input and returns a result for each test case.

Since the specific return value is not provided, we can infer that the function likely returns a list or a series of outputs corresponding to the results of processing each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes input consisting of a positive integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by `t` lines, each containing a positive integer `n` (number of participants) and `n` space-separated integers representing the number of problems solved by each participant in non-increasing order.
