Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `g` is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical integers encountered, `s` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is less than or equal to `g`, `b` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is greater than `g`, `l` is 0, `p` is the last integer processed, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`), `j` is the last integer processed. Additionally, either `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `g` is greater than or equal to `s`, or `g` is greater than or equal to `b`.***
