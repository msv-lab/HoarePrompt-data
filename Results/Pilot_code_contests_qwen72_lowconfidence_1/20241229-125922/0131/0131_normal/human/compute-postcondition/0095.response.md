Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is either 2 (if `s` <= `g`) or 0 (otherwise), `b` is 0 (if `s` <= `g`) or 2 (otherwise), `l` is 2, `p` is the third integer processed, `i` is 2, `j` is the third integer processed, and the input must contain at least three integers. If `i` > `n` // 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
