The code snippet updates the values of `sep` and `file` based on the values in `kwargs`. If `sep` is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to `' '`. If `file` is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. The entries for `sep` and `file` are removed from `kwargs`.

Output State: **args is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type, kwargs is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', sep is a string equal to the value of 'sep' from kwargs or ' ' if 'sep' was not in kwargs, file is a stream object equal to the value of 'file' from kwargs or sys.stdout if 'file' was not in kwargs.**
