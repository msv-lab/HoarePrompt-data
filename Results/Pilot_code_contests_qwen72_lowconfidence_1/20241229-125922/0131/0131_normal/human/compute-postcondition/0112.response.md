To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is greater than 2
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `g` is 0
- `s` is 0
- `b` is 0
- `l` is 0
- `p` is -1
- `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`)
- `j` is the last integer processed

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for (i, j) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input and Splitting**: The loop reads input from the user and splits it into a list of integers using `input().split()`. This means the input should be a string of space-separated integers.
2. **Enumerate**: The `enumerate` function returns pairs of `(index, value)` for each element in the list of integers.
3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if the list of integers is not empty.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Input List**: The loop will only execute if there is at least one integer in the input. Therefore, the input must provide at least one integer.
- **Initial Values**: The initial values of `i` and `j` should be set to the first index and the first integer in the list, respectively.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is greater than 2
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `g` is 0
- `s` is 0
- `b` is 0
- `l` is 0
- `p` is -1
- `i` is 0 (the index of the first integer processed)
- `j` is the first integer in the list of integers from the input

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 0, `p` is -1, `i` is 0, `j` is the first integer in the list of integers from the input, the input must provide at least one integer**
