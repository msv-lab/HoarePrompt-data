Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `g` is the number of distinct integers encountered up to the midpoint of the input, `s` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of the same integer (up to the midpoint) where the sequence count is less than or equal to `g`, `b` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of the same integer (up to the midpoint) where the sequence count is greater than `g`, `l` is the length of the last sequence of the same integer (up to the midpoint), `p` is the last integer encountered (up to the midpoint), `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to the midpoint), `j` is the last integer processed (up to the midpoint). If `n` is 0 or the input is empty, the loop does not execute, and `g`, `s`, `b`, `l`, `p`, `i`, and `j` retain their initial values. Additionally, `g > 0`, `s > 0`, `b > 0`, `g < s`, and `g < b`.***
