Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `g` is not 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 0, `p` is -1, `i` is 0, `j` is the first integer in the list of integers from the input, the input must provide at least one integer. If `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. The current value of `p` is not equal to `j`. Additionally, the current value of `s` is less than or equal to `g`.***
