The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `l` was 1, so the new value of `l` is 2. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `b`, `p`, `i`, `j`, and `g`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 2, `p` is equal to the second integer in the list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `j` is the third integer in the list of integers from the input. If `p` is not equal to `j`, then `l` is 0. If `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `g` is 0, `g` becomes 1, `s` remains 0, and `b` remains 0. If `g` is not 0, the relationship between `s` and `g` is maintained: if `s` <= `g`, then `s` is 1 and `b` is 0; otherwise, `s` is 0 and `b` is 1.**
