The value of `n` is assigned the integer value obtained from the input. The other variables remain unchanged as the code snippet only affects `n`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `g` is the length of the first contiguous sequence of identical integers encountered, `s` is the sum of lengths of contiguous sequences of identical integers that are longer than `g` and appear after `g` is set, `b` is the sum of lengths of contiguous sequences of identical integers that are shorter than `g` and appear after `g` is set, `l` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of identical integers or 0, `p` is the last integer processed, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`), `j` is the last integer processed. If `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `g` is greater than or equal to `s`, or `g` is greater than or equal to `b`, the initial state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the function `func_2(g, s, b)` is called, but assuming `func_2` does not modify its arguments or any global variables, the initial state remains unchanged.**
