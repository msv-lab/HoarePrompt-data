The code snippet assigns the value 0 to the variable `l`. This changes its value from its initial state, which could have been the length of the last contiguous sequence of identical integers or 0, to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 0, `p` is the last integer processed, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`), `j` is the last integer processed.**
