Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 1, `p` is equal to the first integer in the list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `j` is the second integer in the list of integers from the input. If `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and if `p` is not equal to `j`, the current value of `p` is not equal to `j`. If `g` is 0, `g` becomes 1, and `s` remains 0, `b` remains 0. If `g` is not 0, the relationship between `s` and `g` is maintained. If `s` <= `g`, then `s` is 1 and `b` is 0. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and `b` is 1.***
