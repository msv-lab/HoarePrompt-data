The function call `func_2(0, 0, 0)` does not provide enough information about the definition of `func_2` to determine how it affects the state of the variables. However, assuming `func_2` is a function that takes three arguments and possibly modifies some of the global variables mentioned in the initial state, we can infer the following:

- Since the function call does not explicitly return any value, we assume no return value affects the state.
- The function call itself does not modify any of the variables listed in the initial state, as there is no information suggesting otherwise.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `g` is the length of the first contiguous sequence of identical integers encountered, `s` is the sum of lengths of contiguous sequences of identical integers that are longer than `g` and appear after `g` is set, `b` is the sum of lengths of contiguous sequences of identical integers that are shorter than `g` and appear after `g` is set, `l` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of identical integers or 0, `p` is the last integer processed, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`), `j` is the last integer processed. Additionally, either `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `g` is greater than or equal to `s`, or `g` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
