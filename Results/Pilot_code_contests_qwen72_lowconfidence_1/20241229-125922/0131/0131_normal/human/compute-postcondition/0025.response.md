Functionality: ** The function `func_2` prints a series of values to a specified stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separating them with a specified separator (defaulting to a space), and appending a specified end character (defaulting to a newline). It also optionally flushes the stream if the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `'sep'`, `'file'`, and `'end'` during its execution. If `'flush'` is present and `True`, it is also removed after flushing the stream. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include: if `args` is empty, nothing is written to the stream except the `end` character; if `file` is not writable, an error may occur; if `flush` is `True` but the stream does not support flushing, an error may occur. **
