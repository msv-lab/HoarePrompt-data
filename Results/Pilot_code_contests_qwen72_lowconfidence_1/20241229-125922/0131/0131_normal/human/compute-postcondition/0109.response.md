The code snippet assigns the values 0 to the variables `g`, `s`, and `b`. This changes their values from their initial states to 0. The rest of the variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of identical integers or 0, `p` is the last integer processed, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`), `j` is the last integer processed.**
