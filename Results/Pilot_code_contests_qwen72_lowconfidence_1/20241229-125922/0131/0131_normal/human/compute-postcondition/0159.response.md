Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `g` is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical integers encountered, `s` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is less than or equal to `g`, `b` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is greater than `g`, `l` is 0, `p` is the last integer processed, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`), `j` is the last integer processed. If `g == 0` or `s == 0` or `b == 0` or `g >= s` or `g >= b`, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, `g > 0`, `s > 0`, `b > 0`, `g < s`, and `g < b`.***
