The function `func_2(g, s, b)` is called with the arguments `g`, `s`, and `b`. Without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. However, based on the provided initial state and the typical behavior of functions, we can infer that:

- The function may modify the values of `g`, `s`, or `b`, or it may return a value.
- If the function returns a value, it should be noted in the output state.
- If the function does not modify the variables passed to it, their values remain unchanged.

Given the lack of specific details about what `func_2` does, we assume that the function does not modify the global variables directly and does not return a value. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `g` is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical integers encountered, `s` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is less than or equal to `g`, `b` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is greater than `g`, `l` is 0, `p` is the last integer processed, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`), `j` is the last integer processed, `g > 0`, `s > 0`, `b > 0`, `g < s`, and `g < b`.**
