Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `_` is in the range [0, t-1], `n` is a positive integer representing the number of participants in each test case, `g` is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical integers encountered up to the midpoint of the input for the last test case, `s` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is less than or equal to `g` for the last test case, `b` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is greater than `g` for the last test case, `l` is 0, `p` is the last integer processed (up to the midpoint) for the last test case, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to the midpoint) for the last test case, `j` is the last integer processed for the last test case. If `g == 0` or `s == 0` or `b == 0` or `g >= s` or `g >= b` for any test case, `func_2(0, 0, 0)` is called, otherwise `func_2(g, s, b)` is called with the respective values of `g`, `s`, and `b` for the last test case.**
