Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 1, `p` is equal to the second integer in the list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `j` is the third integer in the list of integers from the input. If `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and if `g` is 0, `g` becomes 1, `s` remains 0, and `b` remains 0. If `g` is not 0, the relationship between `s` and `g` is maintained: if `s` <= `g`, then `s` is 1 and `b` is 0; otherwise, `s` is 0 and `b` is 1.***
