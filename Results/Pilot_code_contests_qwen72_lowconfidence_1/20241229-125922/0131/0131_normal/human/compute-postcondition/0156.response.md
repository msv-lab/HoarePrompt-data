The provided code snippet calls a function `func_2` with arguments (0, 0, 0). However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided, so it's impossible to determine the exact changes to the variables without knowing what `func_2` does. Assuming `func_2` does not modify any global variables or return any values, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 2
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `g` is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical integers encountered
- `s` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is less than or equal to `g`
- `b` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is greater than `g`
- `l` is 0
- `p` is the last integer processed
- `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`)
- `j` is the last integer processed
- Either `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `g` is greater than or equal to `s`, or `g` is greater than or equal to `b`

Since `func_2` does not provide any output or modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `g` is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical integers encountered, `s` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is less than or equal to `g`, `b` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is greater than `g`, `l` is 0, `p` is the last integer processed, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`), `j` is the last integer processed, and either `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `g` is greater than or equal to `s`, or `g` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
