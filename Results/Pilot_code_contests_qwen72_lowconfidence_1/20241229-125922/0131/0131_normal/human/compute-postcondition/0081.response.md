The value of `s` is incremented by the value of `l`. Given that `l` is 1, `s` (which was initially 0) becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 1, `b` is 0, `l` is 1, `p` is the first integer processed, `i` is 1, `j` is the second integer processed, and the input must contain at least two integers. If `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
