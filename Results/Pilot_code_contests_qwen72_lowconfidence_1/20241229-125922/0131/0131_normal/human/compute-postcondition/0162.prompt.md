You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer representing the number of participants in each test case, and the input for each test case includes a line with n space-separated integers representing the number of problems solved by each participant in non-increasing order.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        g, s, b = 0, 0, 0
        
        l = 0
        
        p = -1
        
        for i, j in enumerate(map(int, input().split())):
            if i > n // 2:
                break
            if p != j:
                if g == 0:
                    g = l
                elif s <= g:
                    s += l
                else:
                    b += l
                l = 0
            l += 1
            p = j
        
        if g == 0 or s == 0 or b == 0 or g >= s or g >= b:
            func_2(0, 0, 0)
        else:
            func_2(g, s, b)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `_` is in the range [0, t-1], `n` is a positive integer representing the number of participants in each test case, `g` is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical integers encountered up to the midpoint of the input for the last test case, `s` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is less than or equal to `g` for the last test case, `b` is the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is greater than `g` for the last test case, `l` is 0, `p` is the last integer processed (up to the midpoint) for the last test case, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to the midpoint) for the last test case, `j` is the last integer processed for the last test case. If `g == 0` or `s == 0` or `b == 0` or `g >= s` or `g >= b` for any test case, `func_2(0, 0, 0)` is called, otherwise `func_2(g, s, b)` is called with the respective values of `g`, `s`, and `b` for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes input consisting of a positive integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by `t` lines, each containing a positive integer `n` (number of participants) and `n` space-separated integers representing the number of problems solved by each participant in non-increasing order. It returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
