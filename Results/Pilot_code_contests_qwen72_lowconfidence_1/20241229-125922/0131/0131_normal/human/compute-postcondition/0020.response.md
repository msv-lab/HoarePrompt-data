The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value associated with the key `'end'` in `kwargs` to `file`, or writes `'\n'` if `'end'` is not in `kwargs`. After this operation, `'end'` is removed from `kwargs`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key 'flush' but does not contain the key 'end', `sep` is a string equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is a stream object equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`. The string representations of all elements in `args` have been written to `file`, separated by `sep` if there are multiple elements, and the value of 'end' from `kwargs` or `'\n'` has been written to `file`.**
