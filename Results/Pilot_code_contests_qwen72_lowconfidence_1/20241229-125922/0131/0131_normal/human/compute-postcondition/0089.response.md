To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is 0
- `b` is 0
- `l` is 2
- `p` is the second integer processed
- `i` is 1
- `j` is the second integer processed
- The input must contain at least two integers
- If `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is exited

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (i, j) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the enumerated values of the input integers. The loop will continue as long as there are more integers to process in the input.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is the second integer processed.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next integer in the input must be processed. This means `i` should be incremented to 2, and `j` should be set to the third integer processed.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains greater than 0
- `_` remains 1
- `n` remains the same input integer
- `s` remains 0
- `b` remains 0
- `l` remains 2
- `p` is now the third integer processed
- `i` is now 2
- `j` is now the third integer processed
- The input must contain at least three integers for the loop to execute one more time

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 2, `p` is the third integer processed, `i` is 2, `j` is the third integer processed, and the input must contain at least three integers**
