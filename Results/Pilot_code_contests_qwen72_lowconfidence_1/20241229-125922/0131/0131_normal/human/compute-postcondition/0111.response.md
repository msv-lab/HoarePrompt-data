The code snippet `p = -1` changes the value of `p` from the last integer processed to `-1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 0, `p` is -1, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`), `j` is the last integer processed.**
