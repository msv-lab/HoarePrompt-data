Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 0, `p` is -1, `i` is 0, `j` is the first integer processed, the input must contain at least one integer. If `i` > `n // 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `p` is not equal to `j`. Additionally, `g` is 0.***
