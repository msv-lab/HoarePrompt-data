Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 1, `p` is the first integer in the list, the input is a non-empty string that can be split into at least two integers, `i` is 1, `j` is the second integer in the list. If `i` > `n` // 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p` != `j`, `l` is 0. If `g` == 0, `g` remains 0. If `s` <= `g`, then `s` is 1 and `b` is 0. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and `b` is 1. If `g` == 1, then `s` is 0 and `b` is 0.***
