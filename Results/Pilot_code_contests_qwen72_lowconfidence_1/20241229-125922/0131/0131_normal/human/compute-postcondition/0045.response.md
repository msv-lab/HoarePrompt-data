Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is 2, `p` is the second integer in the list, `i` is 2, `j` is the third integer in the list. If `i` > `n` // 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p` is not equal to `j`, then: if `g` is 0, `s` is 2 and `b` is 0 if `s` <= `g`; otherwise, `s` is 0 and `b` is 2. If `g` is not 0, `g` is 2, `s` is 0, and `b` is 0. If `p` equals `j`, the values of `g`, `s`, and `b` remain unchanged.***
