The value of `p` is updated to the value of `j`. Since `j` is the second integer in the list, `p` now holds this value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 2, `p` is the second integer in the list, `i` is 1, `j` is the second integer in the list. If `i` > `n` // 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p` != `j`, `l` is 0. If `g` == 0, `g` remains 0. If `s` <= `g`, then `s` is 1 and `b` is 0. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and `b` is 1. If `g` == 1, then `s` is 0 and `b` is 0.**
