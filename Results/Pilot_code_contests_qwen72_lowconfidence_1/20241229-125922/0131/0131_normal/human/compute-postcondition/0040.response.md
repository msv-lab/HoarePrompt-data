The value of `s` is incremented by the value of `l`. Since `l` is 2, `s` will be incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `s` is 2, `b` is 0, `l` is 2, `p` is the second integer in the list, `i` is 2, `j` is the third integer in the list. If `i` > `n` // 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
