To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is 0.
- `b` is 0.
- `l` is 1.
- `p` is equal to the second integer in the list of integers from the input.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is the second integer in the list of integers from the input.
- If `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
- If `g` is 0, `g` becomes 1, `s` remains 0, and `b` remains 0.
- If `g` is not 0, the relationship between `s` and `g` is maintained: if `s` <= `g`, then `s` is 1 and `b` is 0; otherwise, `s` is 0 and `b` is 1.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for (i, j) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the enumeration of the list of integers obtained from `input().split()`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is the second integer in the list of integers from the input.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- The loop will execute one more time if there is at least one more element in the list.
- The next value of `i` will be 2 (since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration).
- The next value of `j` will be the third integer in the list of integers from the input.

### Updated State:
- `i` will be 2.
- `j` will be the third integer in the list of integers from the input.
- The list must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 1, `p` is equal to the second integer in the list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `j` is the third integer in the list of integers from the input, if `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and if `g` is 0, `g` becomes 1, `s` remains 0, and `b` remains 0. If `g` is not 0, the relationship between `s` and `g` is maintained: if `s` <= `g`, then `s` is 1 and `b` is 0; otherwise, `s` is 0 and `b` is 1.**
