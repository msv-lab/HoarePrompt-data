Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `l` is 2, `p` is the second integer in the list, `i` is 2, `j` is the third integer in the list. If `s` <= `g`, then `s` is 2 and `b` is 0. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and `b` is 2. If `i` > `n` // 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
