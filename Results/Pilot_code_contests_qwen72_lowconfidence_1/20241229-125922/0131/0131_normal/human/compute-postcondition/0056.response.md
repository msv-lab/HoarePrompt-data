The code snippet resets the values of `g`, `s`, and `b` to 0. This impacts the initial state where these variables had specific meanings related to the processing of input integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is the length of the last sequence of the same integer (up to the midpoint), `p` is the last integer encountered (up to the midpoint), `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to the midpoint), `j` is the last integer processed (up to the midpoint)**
