The value of `p` is updated to the value of `j`. Since `j` is the second integer processed, `p` now holds the value of the second integer. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 2, `p` is the second integer processed, `i` is 1, `j` is the second integer processed, and the input must contain at least two integers. If `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
