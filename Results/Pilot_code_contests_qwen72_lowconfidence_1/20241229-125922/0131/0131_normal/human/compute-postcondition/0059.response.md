To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `g` is 0
- `s` is 0
- `b` is 0
- `l` is 0
- `p` is -1
- `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to the midpoint)
- `j` is the last integer processed (up to the midpoint)

### For Loop:
```python
for (i, j) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input and Splitting**: The loop uses `input().split()` to split the input string into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
2. **Enumerate**: The `enumerate` function returns pairs of `(index, value)` for each element in the list of integers.
3. **Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if there is at least one element in the list of integers.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Input List**: The loop will execute only if the list of integers is non-empty. Therefore, the input must contain at least one integer.
- **Initial Values**: The initial values of `i` and `j` should be set to the first index and the first value of the list, respectively.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `g` is 0
- `s` is 0
- `b` is 0
- `l` is 0
- `p` is -1
- `i` is 0 (the index of the first integer processed)
- `j` is the first integer processed
- The input must contain at least one integer

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 0, `p` is -1, `i` is 0, `j` is the first integer processed, the input must contain at least one integer**
