Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key 'flush' but does not contain the key 'end', `sep` is a string equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is a stream object equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`. The string representations of all elements in `args` have been written to `file`, separated by `sep` if there are multiple elements, and the value of 'end' from `kwargs` or `'\n'` has been written to `file`. Additionally, `kwargs` no longer contains the key 'flush', and the value of 'flush' was `True`.***
