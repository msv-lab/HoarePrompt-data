The code snippet `g = l` assigns the value of `l` to `g`. Since `l` is 2, `g` will also be 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 2, `p` is the third integer processed, `i` is 2, `j` is the third integer processed, `g` is 2, and the input must contain at least three integers. If `i` > `n` // 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
