Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer `n` representing the number of participants, followed by `n` space-separated integers in non-increasing order, indicating the number of problems solved by each participant. The function calculates the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical integers (`g`), the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical integers where the length is less than or equal to `g` (`s`), and the sum of the lengths of sequences of consecutive integers where the length is greater than `g` (`b`). If any of these conditions are not met (`g == 0`, `s == 0`, `b == 0`, `g >= s`, or `g >= b`), it calls `func_2(0, 0, 0)`. Otherwise, it calls `func_2(g, s, b)`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value explicitly, but it affects the state of the program by calling `func_2` with the calculated values for each test case. **

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Edge Case:** If `n` is 1, the function will always call `func_2(0, 0, 0)` because `g`, `s`, and `b` will not be updated.
- **Edge Case:** If all participants have the same number of problems solved, the function might incorrectly set `s` and `b` due to the condition `if p != j`.
- **Missing Functionality:** The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer inputs or negative numbers).
- **Missing Functionality:** The function assumes that the input is always valid and does not check for the number of participants being zero or the input list being empty.
