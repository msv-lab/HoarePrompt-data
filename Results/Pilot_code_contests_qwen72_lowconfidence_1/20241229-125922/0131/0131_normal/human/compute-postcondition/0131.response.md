The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently within. This action does not alter the values of the variables but changes the flow of control.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 1, `p` is equal to the first integer in the list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `j` is the second integer in the list of integers from the input, if `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, if `p` is not equal to `j`, the current value of `p` is not equal to `j`, if `g` is 0, the condition remains unchanged, if `g` is not 0, the program ensures that the relationship between `s` and `g` is maintained, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
