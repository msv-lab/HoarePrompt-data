`g` is assigned the value of `l`. The value of `l` is 1, so `g` is now 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 1, `p` is equal to the first integer in the list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `j` is the second integer in the list of integers from the input. If `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and if `p` is not equal to `j`, the current value of `p` is not equal to `j`. `g` is 1.**
