Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is 2, `p` is the third integer processed, `i` is 2, `j` is the third integer processed, and the input must contain at least three integers. If `i` > `n` // 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `g` == 0, the state remains unchanged. If `g` != 0, `s` is 2 if `s` <= `g`, otherwise `s` is 0, and `b` is 0 if `s` <= `g`, otherwise `b` is 2.***
