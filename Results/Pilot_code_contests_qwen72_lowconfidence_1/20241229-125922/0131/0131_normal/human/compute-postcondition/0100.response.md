The code snippet assigns the value of `j` to `p`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is 0
- `b` is 0
- `l` is 3
- `p` is the third integer processed
- `i` is 2
- `j` is the third integer processed

Since `p` is set to `j`, and both were initially the third integer processed, the assignment does not change the value of `p`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 3, `p` is the third integer processed, `i` is 2, `j` is the third integer processed**.
