The function call `func_2(g, s, b)` is made, but without knowing the implementation details of `func_2`, we cannot determine how it affects the variables. However, assuming that `func_2` does not modify its arguments or any global variables, the initial state remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `g` is the length of the first contiguous sequence of identical integers encountered, `s` is the sum of lengths of contiguous sequences of identical integers that are longer than `g` and appear after `g` is set, `b` is the sum of lengths of contiguous sequences of identical integers that are shorter than `g` and appear after `g` is set, `l` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of identical integers or 0, `p` is the last integer processed, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`), `j` is the last integer processed. Additionally, `g` is not 0, `s` is not 0, `b` is not 0, `g` is less than `s`, and `g` is less than `b`.**
