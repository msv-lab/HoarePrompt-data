Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 1, `p` is the first integer processed, `i` is 1, `j` is the second integer processed, and the input must contain at least two integers. If `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `p` != `j`, then if `g` == 0, `g` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `s` <= `g`, `s` is set to 1 and `b` is set to 0. If `s` > `g`, `s` is set to 0 and `b` is set to 1. If `p` == `j`, the variables remain unchanged.***
