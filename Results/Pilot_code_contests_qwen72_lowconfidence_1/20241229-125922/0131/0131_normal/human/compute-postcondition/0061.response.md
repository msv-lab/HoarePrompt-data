The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. Since no variables are directly modified by this statement, their values remain unchanged. However, the control flow changes, which means the program will continue execution from the point immediately following the loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 0, `p` is -1, `i` is 0, `j` is the first integer processed, the input must contain at least one integer, and the current value of `i` is greater than `n // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
