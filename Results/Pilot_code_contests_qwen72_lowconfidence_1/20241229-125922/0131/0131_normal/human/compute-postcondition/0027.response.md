The code `g = l` assigns the value of `l` to `g`. Since `l` is 1, `g` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 1, `s` is 0, `b` is 0, `l` is 1, `p` is the first integer in the list, the input is a non-empty string that can be split into at least two integers, `i` is 1, `j` is the second integer in the list. If `i` > `n` // 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
