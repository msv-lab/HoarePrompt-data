To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop step by step and consider the conditions under which the loop operates.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `g` is 0
- `s` is 0
- `b` is 0
- `l` is 0
- `p` is -1
- `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to the midpoint)
- `j` is the last integer processed (up to the midpoint)

### Loop Code:
```python
for i, j in enumerate(map(int, input().split())):
    if i > n // 2:
        break
    if p != j:
        if g == 0:
            g = l
        elif s <= g:
            s += l
        else:
            b += l
        l = 0
    l += 1
    p = j
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop iterates over the integers provided in the input, up to the midpoint (`n // 2`). This means the loop will execute at most `n // 2 + 1` times.
2. **Variable Updates**:
   - `i` and `j` are updated with each iteration, where `i` is the index and `j` is the integer at that index.
   - `p` is updated to the current `j` at each iteration.
   - `l` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - If `p` is not equal to `j`:
     - If `g` is 0, `g` is set to `l`.
     - If `s` is less than or equal to `g`, `s` is incremented by `l`.
     - Otherwise, `b` is incremented by `l`.
     - `l` is reset to 0.

### Final Output State:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0.
- **`_`**: Remains 1.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer.
- **`g`**: Will be the length of the first contiguous sequence of identical integers encountered, unless no such sequence exists, in which case `g` will remain 0.
- **`s`**: Will be the sum of lengths of contiguous sequences of identical integers that are longer than `g` and appear after `g` is set.
- **`b`**: Will be the sum of lengths of contiguous sequences of identical integers that are shorter than `g` and appear after `g` is set.
- **`l`**: Will be the length of the last contiguous sequence of identical integers, or 0 if the last sequence was broken by a different integer.
- **`p`**: Will be the last integer processed.
- **`i`**: Will be the index of the last integer processed, which is at most `n // 2`.
- **`j`**: Will be the last integer processed, which is the same as `p`.

### Summary:
If the loop does not execute (i.e., the input list is empty or `n` is 0), the variables will retain their initial values. If the loop executes, the variables will be updated as described above.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `g` is the length of the first contiguous sequence of identical integers encountered, `s` is the sum of lengths of contiguous sequences of identical integers that are longer than `g` and appear after `g` is set, `b` is the sum of lengths of contiguous sequences of identical integers that are shorter than `g` and appear after `g` is set, `l` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of identical integers or 0, `p` is the last integer processed, `i` is the index of the last integer processed (up to `n // 2`), `j` is the last integer processed.**
