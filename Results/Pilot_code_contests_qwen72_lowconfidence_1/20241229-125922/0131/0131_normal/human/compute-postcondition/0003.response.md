To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given code:

### Initial State:
- `args` is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush'.
- `sep` is a string equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`.
- `file` is a stream object equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`.
- `at_start` is True.

### For Loop:
```python
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in `args`.
- For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element.
- The other variables (`kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start`) do not directly affect the loop's execution but are part of the initial state.

### Adjusted State:
- `args` must be a non-empty tuple to ensure the loop executes at least once.
- The other variables can remain as they are, as they do not influence the loop's ability to start.

### Final State:
State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least one argument of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is a string equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is a stream object equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is True**
