Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is 1, `p` is the first integer processed, `i` is 1, `j` is the second integer processed, and the input must contain at least two integers. If `i` > `n` // 2, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `g` == 0, then `g` is 1. Otherwise, if `s` <= `g`, then `s` is 1 and `b` is 0. If `s` > `g`, then `s` is 0 and `b` is 1.***
