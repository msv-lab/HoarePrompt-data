Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the constructed graph is connected. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Graph Connectivity**: The program does not explicitly check or ensure that the graph is connected. It only checks if the number of edges `m` has been reached and if the maximum vertex used is `n`. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is connected. A graph can have `m` edges and include all vertices from 1 to `n` without being connected.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to construct a connected graph with the given `n` and `m`. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, it is impossible to construct a connected graph with only one edge. The program should output "Impossible" in such cases, but it does not.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The program uses the `gcd` function from the `fractions` module, which is deprecated in Python 3.5 and later. The correct module to use is `math.gcd`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:
- Input: `5 1`
- Expected Output: "Impossible"
- Actual Output: "Possible" followed by a single edge, which does not form a connected graph.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
