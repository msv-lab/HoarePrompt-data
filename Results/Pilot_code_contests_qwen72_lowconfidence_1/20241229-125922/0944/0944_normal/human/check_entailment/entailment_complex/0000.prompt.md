You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Let's call an undirected graph G = (V, E) relatively prime if and only if for each edge (v, u) ∈ E GCD(v, u) = 1 (the greatest common divisor of v and u is 1). If there is no edge between some pair of vertices v and u then the value of GCD(v, u) doesn't matter. The vertices are numbered from 1 to |V|.

Construct a relatively prime graph with n vertices and m edges such that it is connected and it contains neither self-loops nor multiple edges.

If there exists no valid graph with the given number of vertices and edges then output "Impossible".

If there are multiple answers then print any of them.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the number of vertices and the number of edges.

Output

If there exists no valid graph with the given number of vertices and edges then output "Impossible".

Otherwise print the answer in the following format:

The first line should contain the word "Possible".

The i-th of the next m lines should contain the i-th edge (v_i, u_i) of the resulting graph (1 ≤ v_i, u_i ≤ n, v_i ≠ u_i). For each pair (v, u) there can be no more pairs (v, u) or (u, v). The vertices are numbered from 1 to n.

If there are multiple answers then print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from fractions import gcd

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    edges, cur = [], 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if not m:
                break
            if gcd(i, j) == 1:
                m -= 1
                edges.append('%d %d' % (i, j))
                cur = max(cur, j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `m` is the original `m` minus the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` (and will be 0 if there were enough valid pairs), `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.
    if (m or cur != n) :
        print('Impossible')
    else :
        print('%s\n%s' % ('Possible', '\n'.join(edges)))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `m` is the original `m` minus the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` (and will be 0 if there were enough valid pairs), `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist. If either `m` is non-zero or `cur` is not equal to `n`, the string 'Impossible' has been printed. Otherwise, `m` is 0 and `cur` is equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5`. It then attempts to find `m` pairs of integers `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ n` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `j` is 1. These pairs are stored in a list `edges`. After attempting to find these pairs, the function checks if it successfully found exactly `m` pairs and if the largest `j` used in these pairs is equal to `n`. If both conditions are met, it prints "Possible" followed by the pairs. If either condition fails, it prints "Impossible". The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
