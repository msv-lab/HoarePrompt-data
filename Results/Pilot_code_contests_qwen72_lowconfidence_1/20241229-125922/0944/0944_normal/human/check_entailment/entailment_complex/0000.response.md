Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from fully meeting the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `n = 1` and `m > 0`. According to the problem description, if `n = 1` and `m > 0`, the output should be "Impossible" because it is impossible to construct a graph with a single vertex and any edges. However, the current implementation will attempt to generate edges, which is incorrect.

2. **Graph Connectivity**:
   - The program does not guarantee that the constructed graph is connected. The problem description requires the graph to be connected, but the current implementation only ensures that the edges are relatively prime. It does not check whether the graph is connected, which is a crucial requirement.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The current implementation uses a nested loop to generate edges, which has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\). This is inefficient for large values of \(n\) (up to \(10^5\)). The problem description specifies that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\), and the current approach may not terminate within a reasonable time for large inputs.

### Specific Issues:

- **Handling `n = 1` and `m > 0`**:
  - If `n = 1` and `m > 0`, the program will attempt to generate edges, which is incorrect. The correct output should be "Impossible".

- **Connectivity**:
  - The program does not ensure that the graph is connected. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 6`, the program might generate a set of edges that are relatively prime but not necessarily connected. A connected graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges can be constructed, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.

### Correct Approach:

To meet the problem description, the program should:

1. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - If `n = 1` and `m > 0`, output "Impossible".
   - If `m = 0`, output "Possible" (since a graph with no edges is trivially connected).

2. **Ensure Connectivity**:
   - Use a strategy to ensure the graph is connected. One possible approach is to start by creating a spanning tree (which guarantees connectivity) and then add additional edges to reach the required number of edges `m`.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Use a more efficient algorithm to generate the edges, especially for large values of `n` and `m`.

### Example of a Correct Implementation:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Handle edge cases
    if n == 1 and m > 0:
        print("Impossible")
        return
    if m == 0:
        print("Possible")
        return
    
    edges = []
    
    # Create a spanning tree to ensure connectivity
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        edges.append(f"{i-1} {i}")
        m -= 1
    
    # Add remaining edges
    i = 1
    while m > 0:
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if gcd(i, j) == 1:
                edges.append(f"{i} {j}")
                m -= 1
                if m == 0:
                    break
        i += 1
    
    # Check if we have enough edges
    if m > 0:
        print("Impossible")
    else:
        print("Possible")
        print("\n".join(edges))

# Call the function
func()
```

This implementation handles the edge cases correctly, ensures the graph is connected, and is more efficient for large inputs.
