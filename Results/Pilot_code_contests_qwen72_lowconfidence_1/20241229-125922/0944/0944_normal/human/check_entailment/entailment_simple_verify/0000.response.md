Final: **False**

### Reasoning:

1. **Maximum Number of Edges Constraint**:
   - The problem requires constructing a relatively prime graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, ensuring the graph is connected and contains no self-loops or multiple edges.
   - The program does not handle the case where `m` is greater than the maximum number of edges that can be formed while maintaining the relatively prime condition. This can lead to incorrect outputs where the program might print "Impossible" even when a valid graph could exist, or it might fail to construct the required number of edges.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input `(n=5, m=10)`. The maximum number of edges that can be formed with 5 vertices, ensuring each pair of vertices is relatively prime and the graph is connected, is less than 10. However, the program does not check this condition and will simply try to form 10 edges, which is impossible. As a result, it will output "Impossible" incorrectly.
   - The annotated code confirms that the program will break out of the nested loops once `m` reaches 0, but it does not account for the scenario where `m` exceeds the maximum possible number of valid edges.

3. **Graph Connectivity**:
   - The program does not explicitly ensure that the graph remains connected. While it attempts to form edges between relatively prime pairs, it does not guarantee that the resulting graph is connected.
   - The annotated code shows that the program tracks the maximum value of `j` (`cur`) for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution. However, this does not ensure connectivity.

4. **Deprecation of `gcd` Function**:
   - The program uses the `gcd` function from the `fractions` module, which is deprecated in Python 3.5 and later versions. The recommended function to use is `math.gcd` from the `math` module. While this is not a correctness issue, it is a best practice and compatibility issue.

Given these points, the original assessment of **False** is accurate. The program does not handle the maximum number of edges constraint and does not ensure graph connectivity, leading to potential incorrect outputs. Therefore, the final assessment remains **False**.
