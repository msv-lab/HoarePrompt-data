Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where `m` is greater than the maximum possible number of edges that can be formed with the given `n` vertices while maintaining the condition that the graph is relatively prime and connected. This can lead to incorrect outputs where the program might print "Impossible" even when a valid graph could exist, or it might fail to construct the required number of edges.

For example, consider the input `(n=5, m=10)`. The maximum number of edges that can be formed with 5 vertices, ensuring that each pair of vertices is relatively prime and the graph is connected, is less than 10. However, the program does not check this condition and will simply try to form 10 edges, which is impossible. As a result, it will either output "Impossible" incorrectly or will not form the required number of edges, leading to an incorrect solution.

Additionally, the program uses the `gcd` function from the `fractions` module, which is deprecated in Python 3.5 and later versions. The recommended function to use is `math.gcd` from the `math` module. This is not a correctness issue but a best practice and compatibility issue.
