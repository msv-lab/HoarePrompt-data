Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program may not construct a connected graph when it is possible to do so. Here is a detailed explanation:

1. **Graph Connectivity**: The problem requires the graph to be connected. However, the current implementation does not ensure that the graph remains connected. It simply adds edges between pairs of vertices with GCD 1 until the required number of edges is reached. This approach can lead to a disconnected graph.

2. **Example Case**: Consider the input `n = 4` and `m = 3`. The program might output:
   ```
   Possible
   1 2
   1 3
   1 4
   ```
   This graph is connected and has the correct number of edges, but it is not the only possible output. Another valid output could be:
   ```
   Possible
   1 2
   2 3
   3 4
   ```
   However, the program does not guarantee that it will always produce a connected graph.

3. **Edge Case**: For inputs where `n` is small and `m` is close to the maximum number of edges, the program may fail to construct a valid graph. For example, consider `n = 3` and `m = 3`. The program will output:
   ```
   Impossible
   ```
   However, a valid connected graph with 3 vertices and 3 edges (a triangle) is possible:
   ```
   Possible
   1 2
   2 3
   3 1
   ```

To ensure correctness, the program should include additional logic to guarantee that the graph remains connected while adding edges. One approach could be to start with a connected component and then add additional edges while maintaining connectivity.
