To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 3.
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
- If `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `m` is decremented by 1, `edges` includes an additional element `'2 3'`.
- `cur` is 3.
- The greatest common divisor of `i` and `j` is 1.
- If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. In this case, `i` is 2, so `j` ranges from 3 to `n + 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment by 1, making `j` equal to 4.
4. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `edges` must include the additional element `'2 3'` if `gcd(2, 3) == 1`, which it does.
   - `cur` remains 3 (assuming it is not modified within the loop).

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 4.
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 < m \leq 10^5\) (since `m` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration).
- `edges` includes the element `'2 3'`.
- `cur` is 3.
- The greatest common divisor of `i` and `j` is 1 (this condition must hold for the next iteration to proceed).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `m` is an integer such that \(0 < m \leq 10^5\), `edges` includes the element `'2 3'`, `cur` is 3**
