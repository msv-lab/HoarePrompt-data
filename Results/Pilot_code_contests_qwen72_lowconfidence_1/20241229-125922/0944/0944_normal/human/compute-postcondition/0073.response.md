The code appends a new element to the list `edges`. The new element is a string formatted with the values of `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` are 3 and 6, respectively. The string `'3 6'` is appended to `edges`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `cur`) are not modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than or equal to 6, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, `m` is `m - 1`, `edges` includes `'3 4'`, `'3 5'`, and `'3 6'`, `cur` is 5. If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
