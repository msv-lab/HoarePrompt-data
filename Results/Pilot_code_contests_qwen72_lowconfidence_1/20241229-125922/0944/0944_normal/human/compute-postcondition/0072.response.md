The value of `m` is decremented by 1. Since `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, the new value of `m` is `m - 1`. If `m` becomes 0 after this decrement, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 6, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, `m` is `m - 1`, `edges` includes `'3 4'` and `'3 5'`, `cur` is 5. If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
