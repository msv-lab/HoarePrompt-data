The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is currently executing. Since no changes are made to the variables in this snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\) and the current value of `m` is 0, `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
