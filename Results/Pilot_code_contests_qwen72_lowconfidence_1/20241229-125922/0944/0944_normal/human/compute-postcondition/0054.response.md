Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, `j` starts from 4, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`. `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`. `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist. The current value of `m` is 0.***
