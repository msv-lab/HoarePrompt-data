The code appends the string `'2 3'` to the list `edges`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `m`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The greatest common divisor of `i` and `j` is still 1, and `edges` now includes an additional element.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `m` is \(m - 1\), `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, and includes an additional element `'2 3'`, `cur` is 0, and the greatest common divisor of `i` and `j` is 1.**
