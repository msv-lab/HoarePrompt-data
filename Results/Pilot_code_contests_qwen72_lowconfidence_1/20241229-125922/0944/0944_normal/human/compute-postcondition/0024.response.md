The value of `cur` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j`. Given that `j` is `i + 3` and `cur` was initially 0, `cur` will be updated to `i + 3` if `i + 3` is greater than `cur`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m < 10^5\), `edges` contains the string `'%d %d' % (i, i + 3)`, `cur` is `max(0, i + 3)`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 3`.**
