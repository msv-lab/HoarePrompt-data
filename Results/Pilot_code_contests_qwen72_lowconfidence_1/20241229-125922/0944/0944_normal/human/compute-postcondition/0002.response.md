To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Range of `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(1, n)`, which means `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (i.e., `n > 1`).

2. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\).
   - `edges` is an empty list.
   - `cur` is 0.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1.
   - The variable `i` should start at 1, but this is handled by the `range` function.
   - The other variables (`m`, `edges`, `cur`) do not directly affect the loop's execution, so they remain as they are.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1 (this is implied by the loop itself, so no explicit adjustment is needed for `i`).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `edges` is an empty list, `cur` is 0**
