The value of `cur` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `j`. Given that `cur` is initially `i + 1` and `j` is `i + 2`, `j` is always greater than `cur`. Therefore, `cur` will be updated to the value of `j`, which is `i + 2`.

The conditions for `n`, `m`, `edges`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Since the code snippet does not affect the value of `m`, the condition regarding breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement when `m` is 0 remains as stated in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m < 10^5\) or `m` is -1, `edges` contains the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` and possibly more elements if it was not empty, `cur` is `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`. If `m` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
