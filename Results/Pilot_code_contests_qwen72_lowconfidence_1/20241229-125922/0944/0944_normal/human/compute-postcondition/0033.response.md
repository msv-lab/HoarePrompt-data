The value of `m` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\), the new value of `m` is \(m - 1\). If `m` was initially 0, then decrementing it would make it -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since the precondition specifies that if `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, this breaking condition does not apply here because `m` is being decremented first.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\) and now `m` is \(m - 1\), `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is 0, and the greatest common divisor of `i` and `j` is 1.
