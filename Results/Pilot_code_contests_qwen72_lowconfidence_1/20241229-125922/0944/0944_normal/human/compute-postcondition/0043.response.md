Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `m` is an integer such that \(0 < m \leq 10^5\), `edges` includes the element `'2 3'`. If `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `edges` also includes the element `'2 4'` and `cur` is 4. If `m` is not zero, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
