To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):` will continue as long as `j` is within the range `(i + 1, n + 1)`. This means `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\) or `m` is 0.
   - `edges` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `edges` remains unchanged.
   - `cur` is `i + 2` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `cur` is 0.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `j` is `i + 2`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - `j` will increment by 1 in the next iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < n + 1`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `j` is `i + 2`.

For the next iteration:
- `j` will be `i + 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\) or `m` is 0.
- `edges` remains unchanged unless the GCD condition is met in the current iteration.
- `cur` is `i + 2` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `cur` is 0.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `j` is `i + 3`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\) or `m` is 0, `edges` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `edges` remains unchanged, `cur` is `i + 2` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `cur` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 3`**
