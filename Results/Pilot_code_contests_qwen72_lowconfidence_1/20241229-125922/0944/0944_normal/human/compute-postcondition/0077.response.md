To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has completed its execution, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the changes to the variables step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\).
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `cur` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        if not m:
            break
        if gcd(i, j) == 1:
            m -= 1
            edges.append('%d %d' % (i, j))
            cur = max(cur, j)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(1, n)`):**
   - This loop iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to \(n-1\).

2. **Inner Loop (`for j in range(i + 1, n + 1)`):**
   - For each `i`, this loop iterates over all integers `j` from `i + 1` to `n`.

3. **Condition Check (`if not m`):**
   - If `m` becomes 0, the inner loop breaks immediately, stopping further processing.

4. **GCD Condition (`if gcd(i, j) == 1`):**
   - If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `j` is 1, the following actions are taken:
     - `m` is decremented by 1.
     - A string representation of the pair `(i, j)` is appended to the `edges` list.
     - `cur` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `j`.

### Final Output State:
- **`n`**: Remains the same as the original value, \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- **`m`**: After the loop, `m` will be the original value minus the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`. If there were enough such pairs, `m` will be 0.
- **`edges`**: A list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`. The length of this list will be the number of such pairs found.
- **`cur`**: The maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution. If no such pairs exist, `cur` will remain 0.

### Conclusion:
After the loop has finished executing, the state of the variables will be as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `m` is the original `m` minus the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` (and will be 0 if there were enough valid pairs), `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.**
