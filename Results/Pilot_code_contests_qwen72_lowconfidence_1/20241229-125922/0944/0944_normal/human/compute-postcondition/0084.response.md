Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5`. It then attempts to find `m` pairs of integers `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ n` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `j` is 1. These pairs are stored in a list `edges`. After attempting to find these pairs, the function checks if it successfully found exactly `m` pairs and if the largest `j` used in these pairs is equal to `n`. If both conditions are met, it prints "Possible" followed by the pairs. If either condition fails, it prints "Impossible". The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Edge Case: `m = 0`**: If `m` is 0, the function will immediately print "Possible" without generating any pairs, since no pairs are required.
- **Edge Case: `n = 1`**: If `n` is 1, the function will print "Impossible" because there are no valid pairs `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ 1`.
- **Missing Functionality**: The function does not handle the case where `m` is greater than the number of possible pairs `(i, j)` with `gcd(i, j) == 1`. In such a case, it will print "Impossible" even if it finds all possible pairs, but `m` remains non-zero. This could be a limitation if the user expects the function to handle larger values of `m` more gracefully.
