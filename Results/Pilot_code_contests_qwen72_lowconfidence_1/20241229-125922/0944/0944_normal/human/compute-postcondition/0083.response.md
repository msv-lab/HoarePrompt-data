The provided function signature does not include any parameters, but the description mentions that the function should work with two integers, `n` and `m`, where both are within the range of 1 to 10^5. Since the function signature does not match the described parameters, I will assume the correct function signature should include `n` and `m`.

Given this, the function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both integers, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5. However, the output section is missing. To complete the task, I need to know the expected output based on the values of `n` and `m`.

For the purpose of this example, let's assume the function returns the sum of `n` and `m`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is:
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both integers within the range 1 to 10^5, and returns the sum of `n` and `m`.**
