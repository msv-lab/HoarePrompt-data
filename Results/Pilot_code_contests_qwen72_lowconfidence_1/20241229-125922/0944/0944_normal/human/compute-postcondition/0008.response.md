The value of `m` is decremented by 1. The conditions that `n` is greater than 1, `edges` is an empty list, `cur` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, and the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1 remain unchanged. The new value of `m` is `m - 1`, but since `m` could initially be 0, after this operation, `m` could be a negative integer or a non-negative integer less than \(10^5 - 1\). However, the condition that if `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement remains valid and should be considered in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is now `m - 1`, `edges` is an empty list, `cur` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, if `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1.**
