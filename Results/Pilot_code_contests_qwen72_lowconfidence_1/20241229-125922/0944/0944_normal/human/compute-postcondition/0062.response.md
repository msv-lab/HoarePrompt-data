To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 4.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` starts from 4.
- `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
- `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` and now includes `'3 4'`.
- `cur` is 4.
- If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `gcd(i, j) != 1`, `m`, `edges`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):` will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` starts from 4.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - In the current iteration, `j` is 4.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 5.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will execute again if `j` (which will be 5) is less than or equal to `n`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `j` will be incremented to 5.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5 for the loop to execute again.
   - The values of `m`, `edges`, and `cur` will only change if the condition `gcd(i, j) == 1` is met within the loop body. Since we are not executing the loop body here, we assume these values remain unchanged.

### Final State:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 5.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 5.
- `m` remains the same.
- `edges` remains the same.
- `cur` remains the same.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` and now includes `'3 4'`, and `cur` is 4.**
