To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
- `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
- `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    if not m:
        break
    if gcd(i, j) == 1:
        m -= 1
        edges.append('%d %d' % (i, j))
        cur = max(cur, j)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `n` (inclusive).
   - For each `j`, it checks if `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
   - If `gcd(i, j) == 1`, it decrements `m`, appends the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` to `edges`, and updates `cur` to the maximum of `cur` and `j`.
   - If `m` becomes 0, the loop breaks.

2. **Final State**:
   - **`n`**: Remains unchanged.
   - **`i`**: Remains unchanged at 3.
   - **`m`**: Will be 0 if there were enough valid `(i, j)` pairs to decrement `m` to 0. If there are fewer valid pairs than the initial value of `m`, `m` will be the remaining value.
   - **`edges`**: Contains strings representing all valid `(i, j)` pairs where `gcd(i, j) == 1` that were found during the loop.
   - **`cur`**: Will be the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution. If no such pairs exist, `cur` will remain 0.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1` (and will be 0 if there were enough valid pairs), `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.**
