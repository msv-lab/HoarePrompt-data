The code prints two lines: the first line is 'Possible', and the second line is the joined elements of the `edges` list, each pair separated by a newline. The variables are not altered by this print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `m` is 0, `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is equal to `n`.**
