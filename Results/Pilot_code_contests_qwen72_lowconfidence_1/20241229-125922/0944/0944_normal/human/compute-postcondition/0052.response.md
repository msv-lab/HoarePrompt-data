To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
   - `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
   - `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue, so `n` must be greater than 3.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `m`, `edges`, and `cur` do not directly affect the loop condition. They remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.**
