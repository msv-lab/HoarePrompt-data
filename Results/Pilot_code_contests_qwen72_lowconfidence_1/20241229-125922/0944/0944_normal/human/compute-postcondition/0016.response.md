The code appends the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` to the list `edges`. Given that the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1 (as per the initial state), this operation is valid and will add a new element to `edges`.

- `edges` was initially a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise it was an empty list. After appending, `edges` now contains at least one more element, specifically the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)`.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `m` remains an integer such that \(0 \leq m < 10^5\) or `m` is -1.
- `cur` remains `i + 1` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `cur` is 0.
- `i` remains less than `n`.
- `j` remains `i + 2`.
- If `m` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, which is still true but does not affect the current operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m < 10^5\) or `m` is -1, `edges` contains the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` and possibly more elements if it was not empty, `cur` is `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`. If `m` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
