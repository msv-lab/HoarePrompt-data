To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and initial state:

- The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.
- `i` is initially 2.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
- `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range of Loop**:
   - The loop starts at `i + 1` and goes up to `n + 1`.
   - Given `i` is 2, the loop will start at `3` and go up to `n + 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range `range(3, n + 1)` must contain at least one element.
   - This means `n + 1` must be greater than or equal to `3`.

3. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 to ensure the loop has at least one iteration.
   - `i` is already set to 2, which is correct.
   - `m` is already defined within the required range.
   - `edges` is a list, and its content is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition.
   - `cur` is set to 0 if no such pairs exist, which is correct for the initial state.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` should be 3 (the first value in the range).

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is 0**
