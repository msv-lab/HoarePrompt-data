Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `m` is the original `m` minus the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` (and will be 0 if there were enough valid pairs), `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist. Additionally, `m` is 0 and `cur` is equal to `n`.***
