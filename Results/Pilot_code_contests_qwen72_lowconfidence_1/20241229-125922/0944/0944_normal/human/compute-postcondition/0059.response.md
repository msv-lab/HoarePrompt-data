The code appends a string representation of the pair `(i, j)` to the list `edges`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and `j` starts from 4, the string `'3 4'` is appended to `edges`.

The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `m`, and `cur` remain unchanged, and the condition that `gcd(i, j) == 1` continues to hold.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, `j` starts from 4, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1` minus 1, `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` and now includes `'3 4'`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist, the current value of `gcd(i, j)` is 1.**
