To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Current State:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 4.
   - `m` is an integer such that \(0 < m \leq 10^5\).
   - `edges` includes the element `'2 3'`.
   - If `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `edges` also includes the element `'2 4'` and `cur` is 4.
   - If `m` is not zero, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `(i + 1, n + 1)`.
   - Given `i` is 2, the range for `j` is from 3 to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - `j` is currently 4.

5. **Next Value of `j`:**
   - In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 5.

6. **Condition for the Loop to Continue:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

7. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `j` will be 5 in the next iteration, `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to continue.
   - The other variables (`i`, `m`, `edges`, and `cur`) remain unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `m` is an integer such that \(0 < m \leq 10^5\), `edges` includes the element `'2 3'`. If `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `edges` also includes the element `'2 4'` and `cur` is 4. If `m` is not zero, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
