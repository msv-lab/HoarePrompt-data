The code snippet `cur = max(cur, j)` updates the value of `cur` to the maximum of its current value and the value of `j`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is now `m - 1`.
- `edges` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)`.
- `cur` is 0.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `j` is `i + 1`.
- If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- The GCD of `i` and `j` is 1.

We can deduce the following:

- `cur` is initially 0.
- `j` is `i + 1`.

The `max` function will compare `cur` (which is 0) and `j` (which is `i + 1`). Since `i` is less than `n` and `n` is greater than 1, `j` (which is `i + 1`) is at least 1, which is greater than 0. Therefore, `cur` will be updated to the value of `j`.

Thus, the new value of `cur` is `i + 1`.

The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is now `m - 1`, `edges` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)`, `cur` is `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, if `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1.**
