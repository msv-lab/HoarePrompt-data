`cur` is assigned the maximum value between `cur` and `j`. The value of `cur` was 3 and the value of `j` is 4, so the new value of `cur` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m < 10^5\), `edges` includes the elements `'2 3'` and `'2 4'`, `cur` is 4. If `m` is not zero, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
