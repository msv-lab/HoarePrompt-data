The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The previous values of `n` and `m` are overwritten. The new values of `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, and they still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, and their values are read from the input.**
