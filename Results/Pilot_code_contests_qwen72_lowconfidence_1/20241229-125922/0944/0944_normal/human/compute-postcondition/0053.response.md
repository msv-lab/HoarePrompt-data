To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step:

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
- `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
- `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `j`**: The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Since `i` is 3, the loop will iterate from `4` to `n + 1`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute, the range `range(i + 1, n + 1)` must contain at least one element. This means that `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n`.
3. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 3.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n` must be greater than 3**: This condition is already satisfied.
- **`i` must be 3**: This condition is already satisfied.
- **`j` must start from `i + 1` (which is 4) and go up to `n + 1`**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 4 (since `i + 1` is 4).

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` starts from 4.
- `m` remains as described.
- `edges` remains as described.
- `cur` remains as described.

### State:
**`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, `j` starts from 4, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.**
