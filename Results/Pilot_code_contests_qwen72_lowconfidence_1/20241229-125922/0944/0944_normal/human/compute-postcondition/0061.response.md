Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, `j` starts from 4, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`. If `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `m` is decremented by 1, `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` and now includes `'3 4'`, and `cur` is 4. If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `gcd(i, j) != 1`, `m`, `edges`, and `cur` remain unchanged.***
