The value of `cur` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `j`. Since `j` starts from 4 and is currently 4 (the first valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`), and `cur` is initially the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist, the value of `cur` will be updated to 4 if it was 0, or remain unchanged if it was already greater than or equal to 4.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, `j` starts from 4, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1` minus 1, `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` and now includes `'3 4'`, `cur` is 4.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, `j` starts from 4, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1` minus 1, `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` and now includes `'3 4'`, `cur` is 4.**
