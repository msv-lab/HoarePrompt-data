Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` and now includes `'3 4'`, `cur` is 4. If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
