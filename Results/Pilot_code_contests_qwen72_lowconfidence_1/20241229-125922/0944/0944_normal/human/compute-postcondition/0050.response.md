Postcondition: ***Since `j` will be 5 in the next iteration, `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to continue. If `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `i`, `j`, and `cur` are updated to `cur = max(cur, 5)`, `edges` is updated to include the string '%d %d' % (i, j), and `m` is decremented by 1. If `m` becomes empty (or false) after decrementing, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i`, `m`, `edges`, and `cur` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body.***
