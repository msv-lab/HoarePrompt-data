Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\) or `m` is 0, `edges` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `edges` remains unchanged. `cur` is `i + 2` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `cur` is 0. `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`. If `m` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
