The value of `m` is decremented by 1. Since `m` is an integer such that \(0 < m \leq 10^5\), after decrementing, `m` is now \(m - 1\). The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `edges`, `cur`) are not affected. The condition that if `m` is not zero, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m < 10^5\), `edges` includes the element `'2 3'`, `cur` is 3. If `m` is not zero, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
