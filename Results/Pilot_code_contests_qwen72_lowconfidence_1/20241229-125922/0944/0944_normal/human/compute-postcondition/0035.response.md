The code snippet `cur = max(cur, j)` updates the value of `cur` to the maximum of its current value and the value of `j`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 3
- `m` is \(m - 1\) (this is a bit ambiguous, but let's assume `m` is a value such that `m - 1` is its current value)
- `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, and includes an additional element `'2 3'`
- `cur` is 0
- The greatest common divisor of `i` and `j` is 1

Since `cur` is 0 and `j` is 3, `max(cur, j)` evaluates to 3. Thus, `cur` is updated to 3.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `m` is \(m - 1\), `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, and includes an additional element `'2 3'`, `cur` is 3, and the greatest common divisor of `i` and `j` is 1.**
