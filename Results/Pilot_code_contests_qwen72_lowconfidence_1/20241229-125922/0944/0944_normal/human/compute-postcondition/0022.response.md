The value of `m` is decremented by 1. Since `m` is initially an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\) or `m` is 0, after decrementing, `m` will be an integer such that \(0 \leq m < 10^5\) or `m` will be -1 if it was 0. However, the precondition specifies that if `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, if `m` was 0, the code would not execute, and the state would remain unchanged. Since `m` is decremented, it implies that `m` was not 0 initially.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m < 10^5\), `edges` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `edges` remains unchanged, `cur` is `i + 2` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `cur` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 3`.**
