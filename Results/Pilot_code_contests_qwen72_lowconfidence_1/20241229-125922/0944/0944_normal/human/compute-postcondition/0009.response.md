The code appends a string formatted as `%d %d` (with `i` and `j` as the values) to the `edges` list. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the conditions about `n`, `m`, and the GCD of `i` and `j` also remain unchanged. The only change is in the `edges` list, which now contains one more element.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is now `m - 1`, `edges` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)`, `cur` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, if `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1.**
