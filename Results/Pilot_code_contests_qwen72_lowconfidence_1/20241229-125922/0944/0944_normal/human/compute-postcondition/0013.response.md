The `break` statement does not alter the values of the variables but causes the program to exit from the innermost loop or conditional structure it is currently in. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged, except for the fact that the program control is now outside the loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\) or `m` is 0, `edges` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `edges` is an empty list, `cur` is `i + 1` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `cur` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
