To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the variables and their relationships after all iterations of the loop have finished. We'll consider both the cases where the loop executes and where it does not.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
- `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.
- `i` is 2.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` (which is 3) up to `n + 1`. For each `j`, it checks if `gcd(i, j) == 1`. If true, it:
- Decrements `m` by 1.
- Appends the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` to `edges`.
- Updates `cur` to be the maximum of `cur` and `j`.

The loop breaks if `m` becomes 0.

### Final Output State:
1. **If `m` is 0 initially or becomes 0 during the loop:**
   - The loop will terminate early.
   - `edges` will contain the pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` that were found before `m` became 0.
   - `cur` will be the maximum `j` value for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true.
   - `m` will be 0.
   - `i` will still be 2.
   - `n` will remain the same as the initial value.

2. **If `m` is greater than 0 and the loop completes without `m` becoming 0:**
   - The loop will iterate through all possible `j` values from 3 to `n`.
   - `edges` will contain the pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` that were found.
   - `cur` will be the maximum `j` value for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true.
   - `m` will be the remaining value after all iterations.
   - `i` will still be 2.
   - `n` will remain the same as the initial value.

### Generalized Output State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\). After the loop, `m` will be the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair.
- `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`. After the loop, `edges` will contain all such pairs found.
- `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.**
