Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\) or `m` is 0, `edges` remains unchanged if the GCD of `i` and `j` is not 1; otherwise, `edges` contains the string `'%d %d' % (i, i + 3)`. `cur` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i + 3` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1; otherwise, `cur` remains 0. `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 3`. If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
