To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `cur` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(i + 1, n + 1)` is non-empty.
2. **Range Non-Empty Condition**: For `range(i + 1, n + 1)` to be non-empty, the start value `(i + 1)` must be less than the stop value `(n + 1)`.
3. **Simplifying the Condition**: This means `i + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `i < n`.

### Required Adjustments:
- **`i` must be less than `n`**: This ensures that the range `range(i + 1, n + 1)` is non-empty, allowing the loop to execute.
- **Initial Value of `j`**: When the loop starts, `j` will be `i + 1`.

### Final State:
- `n` is greater than 1 (already given).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\) (already given).
- `edges` is an empty list (already given).
- `cur` is 0 (already given).
- `i` must be less than `n` to ensure the loop executes.
- `j` is `i + 1` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `edges` is an empty list, `cur` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`**
