To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\) or `m` is 0.
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `cur` is 0.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `j` is `i + 1`.
- If the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1:
  - `m` is now `m - 1`.
  - `edges` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)`.
  - `cur` is `i + 1`.
- If the GCD of `i` and `j` is not 1, the state remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1)` will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
2. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `cur`, `i`) will remain unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is `i + 2`.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `cur`, `i`) remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\) or `m` is 0, `edges` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `edges` is an empty list, `cur` is `i + 1` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `cur` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`**.
