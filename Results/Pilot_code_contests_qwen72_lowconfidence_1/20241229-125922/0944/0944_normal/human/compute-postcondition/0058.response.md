The value of `m` is decremented by 1. Since the current value of `gcd(i, j)` is 1, this operation is valid and does not affect the conditions for breaking out of the loop. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `edges`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, `j` starts from 4, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1` minus 1, `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist, the current value of `gcd(i, j)` is 1.**
