To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations, let's analyze the loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `cur` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    if not m:
        break
    if gcd(i, j) == 1:
        m -= 1
        edges.append('%d %d' % (i, j))
        cur = max(cur, j)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` to `n`.
   - For each `j`, it checks if `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
   - If the condition is true, it decrements `m` by 1, appends the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` to `edges`, and updates `cur` to the maximum of its current value and `j`.
   - If `m` becomes 0, the loop breaks.

2. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `m` will be reduced by the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` and `j` is in the range `[i + 1, n]`.
   - `edges` will contain strings representing these pairs.
   - `cur` will be the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution.
   - If no such pairs exist (i.e., no `j` satisfies `gcd(i, j) == 1`), `edges` will remain an empty list and `cur` will remain 0.
   - If `m` was initially 0, the loop would not execute at all, and the state would remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\). Specifically, `m` is the original `m` minus the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
- `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
- `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\) (specifically, `m` is the original `m` minus the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`), `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.**
