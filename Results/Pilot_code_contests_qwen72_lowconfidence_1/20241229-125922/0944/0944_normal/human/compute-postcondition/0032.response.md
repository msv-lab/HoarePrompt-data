Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is 0. The greatest common divisor of `i` and `j` is 1. If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
