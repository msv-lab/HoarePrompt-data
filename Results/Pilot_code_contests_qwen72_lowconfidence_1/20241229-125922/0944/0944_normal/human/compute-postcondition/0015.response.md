The value of `m` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `edges`, `cur`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged. Since `m` was initially an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\) or `m` is 0, after decrementing, `m` is now an integer such that \(0 \leq m < 10^5\) or `m` is -1 if it was 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m < 10^5\) or `m` is -1, `edges` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `edges` is an empty list, `cur` is `i + 1` if the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, otherwise `cur` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`. If `m` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
