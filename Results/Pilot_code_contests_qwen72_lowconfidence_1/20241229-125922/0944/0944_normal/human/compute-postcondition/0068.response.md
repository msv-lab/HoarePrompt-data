Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1`. If `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `m` is decremented by 1, `edges` includes `'3 4'` and `'3 5'`, and `cur` is 5. If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `edges`, and `cur` remain unchanged.***
