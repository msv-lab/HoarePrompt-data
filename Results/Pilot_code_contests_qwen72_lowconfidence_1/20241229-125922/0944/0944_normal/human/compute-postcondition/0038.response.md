The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `m` is an integer such that \(0 < m \leq 10^5\), `edges` includes the element `'2 3'`, `cur` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
