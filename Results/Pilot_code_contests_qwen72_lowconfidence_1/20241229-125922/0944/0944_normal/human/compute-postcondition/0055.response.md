The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. However, since no specific loop or conditional structure is mentioned in the code snippet, we assume this `break` is part of a loop or conditional block. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the flow of the program is altered to exit the loop or condition.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, `j` starts from 4, `m` is 0, `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
