The code appends a formatted string to the `edges` list. The string is formed by converting the current values of `i` and `j` to strings and concatenating them with a space in between. The rest of the state remains unchanged except for the `edges` list which now includes this new string.

Since `j` will be 5 in the next iteration, `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to continue. `i`, `j`, `edges`, and `cur` remain unchanged. `m` is `m - 1`. If `m` is now empty (or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **Since `j` will be 5 in the next iteration, `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to continue. `i`, `j`, and `cur` remain unchanged. `edges` is updated to include the string '%d %d' % (i, j). `m` is `m - 1`. If `m` is now empty (or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
