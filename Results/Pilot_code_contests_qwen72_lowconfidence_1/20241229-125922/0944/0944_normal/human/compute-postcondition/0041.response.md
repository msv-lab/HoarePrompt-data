The code appends the string formatted with the current values of `i` and `j` to the list `edges`. The values of `i` and `j` are 2 and 4 respectively, so the string `'2 4'` is appended to `edges`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `m`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The condition that `m` is not zero leading to exiting the most internal loop or if statement is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m < 10^5\), `edges` includes the elements `'2 3'` and `'2 4'`, `cur` is 3. If `m` is not zero, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
