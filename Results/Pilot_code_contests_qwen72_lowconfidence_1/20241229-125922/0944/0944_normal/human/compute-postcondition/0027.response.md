To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop:

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\), specifically `m` is the original `m` minus the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
- `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`.
- `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i` for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was previously some value less than `n`, the new value of `i` will be that value plus 1. Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\) (specifically, `m` is the original `m` minus the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`), `edges` is a list of strings, each representing a pair `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist, `i` is 2**.
