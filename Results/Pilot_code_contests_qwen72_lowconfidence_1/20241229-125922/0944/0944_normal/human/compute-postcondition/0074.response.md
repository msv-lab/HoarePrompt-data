The value of `cur` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `j`. Given that `j` is 6 and `cur` is 5, `cur` will be updated to 6.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than or equal to 6, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, `m` is `m - 1`, `edges` includes `'3 4'`, `'3 5'`, and `'3 6'`, `cur` is 6. If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
