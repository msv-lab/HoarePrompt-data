Postcondition: ***Since `j` will be 5 in the next iteration, `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to continue. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `edges`, and `cur`) remain unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body. If `m` is empty (or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged.***
