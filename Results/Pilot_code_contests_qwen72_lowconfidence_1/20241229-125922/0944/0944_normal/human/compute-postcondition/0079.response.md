The code snippet provided simply prints the string 'Impossible'. This action does not alter the values of any variables or the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the string 'Impossible' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `m` is the original `m` minus the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1` (and will be 0 if there were enough valid pairs), `edges` is a list of strings representing pairs `(i, j)` where `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `cur` is the maximum value of `j` for which `gcd(i, j) == 1` was true during the loop execution, or 0 if no such pairs exist. Either `m` is non-zero or `cur` is not equal to `n`. The string 'Impossible' has been printed.**
