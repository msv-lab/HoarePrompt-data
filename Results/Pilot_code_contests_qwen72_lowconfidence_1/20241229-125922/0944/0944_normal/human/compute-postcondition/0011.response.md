Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\) or `m` is 0, `edges` is an empty list, `cur` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`. If the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, then `m` is now `m - 1`, `edges` is a list containing the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)`, `cur` is `i + 1`, and if `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the GCD of `i` and `j` is not 1, the state remains unchanged.***
