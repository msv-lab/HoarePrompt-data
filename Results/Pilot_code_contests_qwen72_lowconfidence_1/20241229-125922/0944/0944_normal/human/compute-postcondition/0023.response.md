The code appends the string `'%d %d' % (i, j)` to the list `edges`. Given that `j` is `i + 3` and the GCD of `i` and `j` is 1, this string represents a pair of integers where the GCD condition is met. The value of `cur` is updated to `i + 2` based on the same condition. However, the code snippet provided does not change the value of `cur` directly; it only modifies `edges`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m < 10^5\), `edges` contains the string `'%d %d' % (i, i + 3)`, `cur` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 3`.**
