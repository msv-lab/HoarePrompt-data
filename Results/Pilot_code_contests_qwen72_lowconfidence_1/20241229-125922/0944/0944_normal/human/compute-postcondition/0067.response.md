`cur` is updated to the maximum value between its current value (4) and `j` (5). Since 5 is greater than 4, `cur` is now 5. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `m` is the remaining value after decrementing for each valid `(i, j)` pair where `gcd(i, j) == 1` minus 1, `edges` includes `'3 4'` and `'3 5'`, `cur` is 5. If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
