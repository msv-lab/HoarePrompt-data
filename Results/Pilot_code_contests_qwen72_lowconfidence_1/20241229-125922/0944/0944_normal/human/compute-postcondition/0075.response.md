Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 6, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, `m` is `m - 1` if `gcd(i, j) == 1`, `edges` includes `'3 4'` and `'3 5'`, and possibly `'3 6'` if `gcd(i, j) == 1`. `cur` is updated to 6 if `gcd(i, j) == 1`, otherwise `cur` remains 5. If `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
