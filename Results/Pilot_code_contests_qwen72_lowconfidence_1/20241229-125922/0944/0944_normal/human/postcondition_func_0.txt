The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5`. It then attempts to find `m` pairs of integers `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ n` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `j` is 1. These pairs are stored in a list `edges`. After attempting to find these pairs, the function checks if it successfully found exactly `m` pairs and if the largest `j` used in these pairs is equal to `n`. If both conditions are met, it prints "Possible" followed by the pairs. If either condition fails, it prints "Impossible". The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
