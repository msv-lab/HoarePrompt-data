The code snippet provided involves calling a function `func_1` with `n` and `MOD` as arguments. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `F` and `I`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within certain bounds, and `MOD` is a constant value of 998244353. After the function call, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the new variables `F` and `I` are introduced with values returned by `func_1`.

Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `F` and `I`. However, we can describe their introduction in the output state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n - 1; `MOD` is 998244353, `F` and `I` are the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`**.
