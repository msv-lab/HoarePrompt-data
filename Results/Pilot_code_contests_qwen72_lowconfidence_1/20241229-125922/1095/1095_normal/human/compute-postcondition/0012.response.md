The function `func_3` does not explicitly show any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function should accept three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer within the range 0 to n - 1. Since the output section is not provided, I cannot specify the exact return value without additional information. However, typically, a function with such constraints might return a value that depends on the relationship between `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Given the lack of specific output information, I will describe the function's parameters and leave the return value open-ended.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n - 1. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `n`, `m`, and `k`.**
