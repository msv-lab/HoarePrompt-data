The code provided performs a calculation involving the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `MOD`, `F`, `I`, and `ans`. It computes the value of `ans` using a summation formula and then prints `ans % MOD`.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step impact of the code:

1. **Summation Calculation**:
   - The variable `ans` is computed as the sum of the expression `func_2(n - 1, i - 1, MOD, F, I) * m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD) % MOD` for `i` ranging from `n - k` to `n`.
   - This means `ans` is updated based on the results of the function calls and the modular arithmetic operations.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - After computing `ans`, the expression `ans % MOD` is calculated and printed.

3. **State Update**:
   - The value of `ans` is updated to `ans % MOD` before printing.
   - The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `MOD`, `F`, `I`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\).
- `MOD` is 998244353.
- `F` and `I` are the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`.
- `ans` is the sum of the specified expression.

After executing the code, the output state is:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\).
- `MOD` is 998244353.
- `F` and `I` are the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`.
- `ans` is the value of the sum of `func_2(n - 1, i - 1, MOD, F, I) * m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD) % MOD` for `i` from `n - k` to `n`.
- The value `ans % MOD` is printed.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\); `MOD` is 998244353; `F` and `I` are the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`; `ans` is the value of the sum of `func_2(n - 1, i - 1, MOD, F, I) * m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD) % MOD` for `i` from `n - k` to `n`; the value `ans % MOD` is printed.**
