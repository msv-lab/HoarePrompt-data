The code snippet assigns a specific value to the variable `MOD`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `k`, which remain within their specified ranges. The new state reflects this assignment.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n - 1; `MOD` is 998244353**
