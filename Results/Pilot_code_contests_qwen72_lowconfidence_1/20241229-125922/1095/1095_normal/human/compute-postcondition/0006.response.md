To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\).
- `MOD` is 998244353.
- `F` and `I` are the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`.
- `ans` is updated as `ans + func_2(n - 1, i - 1, MOD, F, I) * m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD) % MOD`.
- `i` is `n - k`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - k, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `n - k` to `n` (inclusive). This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within this range.
2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - k`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

### Adjusted States:
- **`i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `n - k + 1`.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is updated in the loop body, but we don't need to specify the exact update here. We only need to ensure that the loop condition is met.

### Final State:
The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the increment of `i`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\); `MOD` is 998244353; `F` and `I` are the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`; `ans` is updated as per the loop body; `i` is `n - k + 1`**
