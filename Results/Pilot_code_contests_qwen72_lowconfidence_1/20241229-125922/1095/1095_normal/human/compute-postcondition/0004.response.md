To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and conditions based on the given for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\).
- `MOD` is 998244353.
- `F` and `I` are the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`.
- `ans` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - k, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over the range from `n - k` to `n` (inclusive). This means the loop will execute if and only if `n - k` is less than or equal to `n`.
2. **Initial Condition**: For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of `i` (which is `n - k`) must be less than or equal to the ending value of `i` (which is `n`).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Check the Range**: The loop will execute if `n - k <= n`. Since `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\), this condition is always true.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to `n - k`.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `MOD`, `F`, `I`, and `ans`) do not directly affect the loop's execution, but they are part of the initial state.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is `n - k` (the starting value for the loop).
- `n - k` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute, which is always true given the constraints on `k`.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\); `MOD` is 998244353; `F` and `I` are the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`; `ans` is 0; `i` is `n - k`**
