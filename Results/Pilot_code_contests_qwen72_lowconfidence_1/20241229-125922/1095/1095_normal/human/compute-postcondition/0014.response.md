Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (a non-negative integer) and `q` (a positive integer greater than 1). It computes and returns two lists, `fact` and `inv`. `fact` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `fact[i]` is the factorial of `i` modulo `q`. `inv` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `inv[i]` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `fact[i]` modulo `q` for each `i` in the range `[1, n]`, and `inv[0]` is always 1. The function handles the edge case where `n` is 0 by returning `[1]` for both `fact` and `inv`. **

Explanation:
- The function initializes two lists, `fact` and `inv`, with a length of `n + 1`, setting all initial values to 1.
- It then iterates from 1 to `n`, updating `fact[i]` to be the factorial of `i` modulo `q`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `inv[i]` as the modular multiplicative inverse of `fact[i]` modulo `q`.
- The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 0, ensuring that both `fact` and `inv` are `[1]`.
- The function does not modify the input parameters `n` and `q`.
- The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `fact` contains the factorials modulo `q` and `inv` contains the modular inverses of these factorials, with `inv[0]` always being 1.
