The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `MOD`, `F`, and `I` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n - 1; `MOD` is 998244353, `F` and `I` are the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`, `ans` is 0**
