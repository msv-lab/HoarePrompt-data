To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the changes in the variables over the iterations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\).
- `MOD` is 998244353.
- `F` and `I` are the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n - k, n + 1):
    ans += func_2(n - 1, i - 1, MOD, F, I) * m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD) % MOD
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates from `i = n - k` to `i = n`. This means the loop will run `k + 1` times.
2. **Update of `ans`**: In each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression:
   \[
   \text{func\_2}(n - 1, i - 1, \text{MOD}, F, I) \times m \times \text{pow}(m - 1, i - 1, \text{MOD}) \mod \text{MOD}
   \]
3. **Final Value of `ans`**: After all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of the results of the above expression for each `i` from `n - k` to `n`.

### Output State:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state.
- `MOD` remains 998244353.
- `F` and `I` remain the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`.
- `ans` is the sum of the results of the expression for each `i` from `n - k` to `n`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\); `MOD` is 998244353; `F` and `I` are the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`, `ans` is the sum of `func_2(n - 1, i - 1, MOD, F, I) * m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD) % MOD` for `i` from `n - k` to `n`.**
