To determine the adjustments needed for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can execute and how the variables change from one iteration to the next.

### Given:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from `n - k` and ending at `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `i` is `n - k + 1`.
  - `ans` is updated using the formula: `ans + (func_2(n - 1, i - 1, MOD, F, I) * m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD)) % MOD`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - k, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Condition**: The loop starts with `i = n - k`.
2. **End Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`.
3. **Iteration Increment**: In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

### Current State:
- `i` is `n - k + 1`.
- `ans` is updated based on the given formula.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `n - k + 2`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is now `n - k + 2`.
- `ans` will be updated again using the same formula with the new value of `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\); `MOD` is 998244353; `F` and `I` are the values returned by `func_1(n, MOD)`, `i` is `n - k + 2`; `ans` is updated to `ans + (func_2(n - 1, i - 1, MOD, F, I) * m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD)) % MOD`.**
