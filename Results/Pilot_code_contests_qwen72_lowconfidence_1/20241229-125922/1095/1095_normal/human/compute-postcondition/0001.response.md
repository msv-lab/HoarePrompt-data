The function `rli()` is assumed to read a line of input and return a list of integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from this input, while `MOD` remains unchanged. The constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k` must still hold true after the assignment.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n - 1; `MOD` is 998244353, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from input.**
