The function `func_3` accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\). It computes a result using a combination of precomputed values from `func_1` and iterative calculations involving `func_2`. The final result is printed modulo 998244353. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the computed result is printed. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `k` is 0 or `n-1`, which may affect the range of the loop and thus the final result.
