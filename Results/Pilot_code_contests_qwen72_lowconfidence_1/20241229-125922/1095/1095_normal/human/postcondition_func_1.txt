The function `func_2` takes five parameters: `n`, `k`, `q`, `F`, and `I`. `n` and `k` are non-negative integers with the constraint `0 <= k <= n`. `q` is a positive integer. `F` and `I` are lists of integers where `F[n]`, `I[k]`, and `I[n - k]` are defined and non-negative. The function returns the result of the expression `(F[n] * (I[k] * I[n - k] % q)) % q`.

Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If `n` is less than `k`, the function will still execute, but it will access `I[n - k]`, which might be out of bounds if `n < k`. This should be handled to avoid index errors.
- If `F` or `I` do not have the required indices defined, the function will raise an `IndexError`.
- The function assumes that `F[n]`, `I[k]`, and `I[n - k]` are non-negative integers, but this is not enforced by the function itself. If these values are not non-negative, the behavior of the function may be undefined or incorrect.
