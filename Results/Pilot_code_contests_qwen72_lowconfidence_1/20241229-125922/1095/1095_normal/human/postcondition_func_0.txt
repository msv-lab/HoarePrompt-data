The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (a non-negative integer) and `q` (a positive integer greater than 1). It computes and returns two lists, `fact` and `inv`. `fact` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `fact[i]` is the factorial of `i` modulo `q`. `inv` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `inv[i]` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `fact[i]` modulo `q` for each `i` in the range `[1, n]`, and `inv[0]` is always 1. The function handles the edge case where `n` is 0 by returning `[1]` for both `fact` and `inv`.
