You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N blocks arranged in a row. Let us paint these blocks.

We will consider two ways to paint the blocks different if and only if there is a block painted in different colors in those two ways.

Find the number of ways to paint the blocks under the following conditions:

* For each block, use one of the M colors, Color 1 through Color M, to paint it. It is not mandatory to use all the colors.
* There may be at most K pairs of adjacent blocks that are painted in the same color.



Since the count may be enormous, print it modulo 998244353.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq K \leq N - 1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M K


Output

Print the answer.

Functions with output description for each function:

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, q):
    fact = [1 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    inv = [1 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % q
        inv[i] = pow(fact[i], q - 2, q)
    return (fact, inv)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (a non-negative integer) and `q` (a positive integer greater than 1). It computes and returns two lists, `fact` and `inv`. `fact` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `fact[i]` is the factorial of `i` modulo `q`. `inv` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `inv[i]` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `fact[i]` modulo `q` for each `i` in the range `[1, n]`, and `inv[0]` is always 1. The function handles the edge case where `n` is 0 by returning `[1]` for both `fact` and `inv`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, k, q, F, I):
    return F[n] * (I[k] * I[n - k] % q) % q
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` takes five parameters: `n`, `k`, `q`, `F`, and `I`. `n` and `k` are non-negative integers with the constraint `0 <= k <= n`. `q` is a positive integer. `F` and `I` are lists of integers where `F[n]`, `I[k]`, and `I[n - k]` are defined and non-negative. The function returns the result of the expression `(F[n] * (I[k] * I[n - k] % q)) % q`.

Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If `n` is less than `k`, the function will still execute, but it will access `I[n - k]`, which might be out of bounds if `n < k`. This should be handled to avoid index errors.
- If `F` or `I` do not have the required indices defined, the function will raise an `IndexError`.
- The function assumes that `F[n]`, `I[k]`, and `I[n - k]` are non-negative integers, but this is not enforced by the function itself. If these values are not non-negative, the behavior of the function may be undefined or incorrect.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    MOD = 998244353
    (n, m, k) = rli()
    (F, I) = func_1(n, MOD)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - k, n + 1):
        ans += func_2(n - 1, i - 1, MOD, F, I) * m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD) % MOD
    print(ans % MOD)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\). It computes a result using a combination of precomputed values from `func_1` and iterative calculations involving `func_2`. The final result is printed modulo 998244353. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the computed result is printed. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `k` is 0 or `n-1`, which may affect the range of the loop and thus the final result.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
