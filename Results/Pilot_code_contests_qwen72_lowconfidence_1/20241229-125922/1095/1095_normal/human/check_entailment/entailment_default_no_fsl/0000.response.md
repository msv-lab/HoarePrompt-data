Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Factorial and Inverse Calculation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` computes the factorials and their modular inverses up to `n` modulo `q`. This is necessary for combinatorial calculations later in the main function.
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 0 by initializing `fact` and `inv` with `[1]`.

2. **Combinatorial Calculation (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) modulo `q` using the precomputed factorials and inverses.
   - The function ensures that the indices `k` and `n - k` are within bounds, which is crucial for avoiding index errors.

3. **Main Function (`func_3`)**:
   - The function `func_3` reads the input values `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It computes the required result using a combination of precomputed values from `func_1` and the combinatorial calculations from `func_2`.
   - The loop iterates over the range from `n - k` to `n`, which correctly accounts for the number of ways to paint the blocks with at most `k` pairs of adjacent blocks having the same color.
   - The final result is printed modulo 998244353.

### Verification of Edge Cases:
- **When `k` is 0**:
  - The loop in `func_3` will only run for `i = n`, which means there are no adjacent blocks with the same color. This is handled correctly.
- **When `k` is `n - 1`**:
  - The loop in `func_3` will run from `1` to `n`, which allows for the maximum number of adjacent blocks with the same color. This is also handled correctly.
- **General Case**:
  - The combinatorial calculation in `func_2` ensures that the number of ways to choose `i` blocks from `n - 1` is correctly computed, and the multiplication with the number of ways to paint the blocks is done modulo 998244353.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the code appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
