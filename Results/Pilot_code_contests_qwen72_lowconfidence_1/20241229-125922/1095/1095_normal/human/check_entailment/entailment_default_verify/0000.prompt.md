You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N blocks arranged in a row. Let us paint these blocks.

We will consider two ways to paint the blocks different if and only if there is a block painted in different colors in those two ways.

Find the number of ways to paint the blocks under the following conditions:

* For each block, use one of the M colors, Color 1 through Color M, to paint it. It is not mandatory to use all the colors.
* There may be at most K pairs of adjacent blocks that are painted in the same color.



Since the count may be enormous, print it modulo 998244353.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq K \leq N - 1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M K


Output

Print the answer.

Program:

from sys import stdin, stdout, setrecursionlimit
from functools import lru_cache
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, q):
    fact = [1 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    inv = [1 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % q
        inv[i] = pow(fact[i], q - 2, q)
    return (fact, inv)

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, k, q, F, I):
    return F[n] * (I[k] * I[n - k] % q) % q

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    MOD = 998244353
    (n, m, k) = rli()
    (F, I) = func_1(n, MOD)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - k, n + 1):
        ans += func_2(n - 1, i - 1, MOD, F, I) * m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD) % MOD
    print(ans % MOD)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem of counting the number of ways to paint the blocks under the given constraints. The approach uses combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming techniques to efficiently calculate the result, taking into account the modulo operation to handle large numbers. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` work together to precompute factorials and their modular inverses, and then use these to compute the required combinations and final answer. The constraints and the problem's requirements are adhered to, and no obvious edge cases or logical errors are present in the code. Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided implementation, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n - 1\). It computes a result using a combination of precomputed values from `func_1` and iterative calculations involving `func_2`. The final result is printed modulo 998244353. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the computed result is printed. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `k` is 0 or `n-1`, which may affect the range of the loop and thus the final result.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
