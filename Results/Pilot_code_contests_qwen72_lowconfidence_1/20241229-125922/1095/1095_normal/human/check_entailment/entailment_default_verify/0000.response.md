Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program correctly implements the solution for the problem of counting the number of ways to paint the blocks under the given constraints. The program uses combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming techniques to efficiently calculate the result, taking into account the modulo operation to handle large numbers. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` work together to precompute factorials and their modular inverses, and then use these to compute the required combinations and final answer. The constraints and the problem's requirements are adhered to, and no obvious edge cases or logical errors are present in the code.

The output hints confirm that the function `func_3` correctly handles the input parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` within the specified ranges and computes the result modulo 998244353. The potential edge cases mentioned, such as when `k` is 0 or `n-1`, are handled appropriately by the loop and the combinatorial calculations. Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the program is correct.
