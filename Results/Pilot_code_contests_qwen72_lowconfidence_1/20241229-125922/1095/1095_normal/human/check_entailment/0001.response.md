Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the constraints and logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of ways to paint the blocks with at most \(K\) pairs of adjacent blocks painted in the same color is flawed. The issue lies in the loop and the way the combinations are being calculated and used.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Combination Calculation**: The function `func_2` calculates combinations using the precomputed factorials and their modular inverses. However, the combination calculation itself seems correct.

2. **Main Logic**: The main logic in `func_3` is incorrect. The loop iterates from `n - k` to `n`, which is not the correct range for the problem. The problem requires considering up to \(K\) pairs of adjacent blocks painted the same color, but the loop does not correctly reflect this requirement.

3. **Combination Usage**: The combination is used to calculate the number of ways to choose positions for the pairs of adjacent blocks painted the same color, but the formula used in the loop is not correct. The term `m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD)` is not correctly accounting for the different ways to paint the blocks with the given constraints.

4. **Example Case**: Consider the input `3 2 1`. The correct output should be 6, but the program's logic will not produce this result due to the incorrect loop and combination usage.

To correct the program, the loop should iterate over the possible number of adjacent pairs from 0 to \(K\), and the combination and power calculations should be adjusted to correctly reflect the problem's constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin, stdout, setrecursionlimit
from functools import lru_cache

def func_1(n, q):
    fact = [1 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    inv = [1 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % q
        inv[i] = pow(fact[i], q - 2, q)
    return (fact, inv)

def func_2(n, k, q, F, I):
    return F[n] * (I[k] * I[n - k] % q) % q

def func_3():
    MOD = 998244353
    (n, m, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    (F, I) = func_1(n, MOD)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(k + 1):
        ans += func_2(n - 1, i, MOD, F, I) * pow(m, n - i, MOD) * pow(m - 1, i, MOD) % MOD
    print(ans % MOD)

func_3()
```

This corrected version should handle all the constraints and edge cases correctly.
