You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N blocks arranged in a row. Let us paint these blocks.

We will consider two ways to paint the blocks different if and only if there is a block painted in different colors in those two ways.

Find the number of ways to paint the blocks under the following conditions:

* For each block, use one of the M colors, Color 1 through Color M, to paint it. It is not mandatory to use all the colors.
* There may be at most K pairs of adjacent blocks that are painted in the same color.



Since the count may be enormous, print it modulo 998244353.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq K \leq N - 1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the constraints and logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of ways to paint the blocks with at most \(K\) pairs of adjacent blocks painted in the same color is flawed. The issue lies in the loop and the way the combinations are being calculated and used.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Combination Calculation**: The function `func_2` calculates combinations using the precomputed factorials and their modular inverses. However, the combination calculation itself seems correct.

2. **Main Logic**: The main logic in `func_3` is incorrect. The loop iterates from `n - k` to `n`, which is not the correct range for the problem. The problem requires considering up to \(K\) pairs of adjacent blocks painted the same color, but the loop does not correctly reflect this requirement.

3. **Combination Usage**: The combination is used to calculate the number of ways to choose positions for the pairs of adjacent blocks painted the same color, but the formula used in the loop is not correct. The term `m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD)` is not correctly accounting for the different ways to paint the blocks with the given constraints.

4. **Example Case**: Consider the input `3 2 1`. The correct output should be 6, but the program's logic will not produce this result due to the incorrect loop and combination usage.

To correct the program, the loop should iterate over the possible number of adjacent pairs from 0 to \(K\), and the combination and power calculations should be adjusted to correctly reflect the problem's constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin, stdout, setrecursionlimit
from functools import lru_cache

def func_1(n, q):
    fact = [1 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    inv = [1 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % q
        inv[i] = pow(fact[i], q - 2, q)
    return (fact, inv)

def func_2(n, k, q, F, I):
    return F[n] * (I[k] * I[n - k] % q) % q

def func_3():
    MOD = 998244353
    (n, m, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    (F, I) = func_1(n, MOD)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(k + 1):
        ans += func_2(n - 1, i, MOD, F, I) * pow(m, n - i, MOD) * pow(m - 1, i, MOD) % MOD
    print(ans % MOD)

func_3()
```

This corrected version should handle all the constraints and edge cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
