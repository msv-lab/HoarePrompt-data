Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Factorial and Inverse Calculation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the factorials and their modular inverses up to `n` modulo `q`. This is necessary for combinatorial calculations.
   - The function correctly initializes `fact` and `inv` arrays and computes the values using modular arithmetic.

2. **Combinatorial Calculation (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` uses the precomputed factorials and inverses to calculate the binomial coefficient modulo `q`.
   - It correctly handles the computation of the binomial coefficient and ensures that the indices are within bounds.

3. **Main Function (`func_3`)**:
   - The function `func_3` reads the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` and computes the number of ways to paint the blocks.
   - It correctly uses the precomputed values from `func_1` and iterates over the possible values of `i` to compute the result.
   - The loop range is from `n - k` to `n`, which ensures that the number of adjacent blocks painted the same color does not exceed `k`.
   - The final result is printed modulo 998244353, as required.

The program handles edge cases such as `k = 0` and `k = n - 1` correctly. The loop range and the combinatorial calculations ensure that the program works for all valid inputs within the given constraints. The provided examples also match the expected outputs, further confirming the correctness of the program.
