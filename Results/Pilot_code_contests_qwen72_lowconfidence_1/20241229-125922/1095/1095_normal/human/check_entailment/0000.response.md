Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem of counting the number of ways to paint the blocks under the given constraints. The approach uses combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming techniques to efficiently calculate the result, taking into account the modulo operation to handle large numbers. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` work together to precompute factorials and their modular inverses, and then use these to compute the required combinations and final answer. The constraints and the problem's requirements are adhered to, and no obvious edge cases or logical errors are present in the code. Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided implementation, the program is correct.
