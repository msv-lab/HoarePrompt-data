Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_3` contains a logical error in the loop that calculates the number of ways to paint the blocks. Specifically, the loop iterates over the range `for i in range(n - k, n + 1)`, but the correct range should be `for i in range(k + 1)`.

### Explanation of the Error:
1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires finding the number of ways to paint the blocks such that there are at most `K` pairs of adjacent blocks that are painted in the same color. The range of `i` in the loop should correspond to the number of pairs of adjacent blocks that are painted the same color, which ranges from `0` to `k`.

2. **Current Implementation**: The current implementation uses `for i in range(n - k, n + 1)`, which is incorrect because it does not correctly represent the number of pairs of adjacent blocks that are painted the same color. This range is off by a factor of `n - k` and does not align with the problem's constraints.

3. **Correct Range**: The correct range should be `for i in range(k + 1)`, which ensures that `i` ranges from `0` to `k`, representing the number of pairs of adjacent blocks that are painted the same color.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input `N = 3`, `M = 2`, `K = 1`. According to the problem, the correct output should be `6`. However, with the current implementation, the loop will iterate over `i` in the range `range(2, 4)`, which is incorrect. The correct range should be `range(0, 2)`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_3():
    MOD = 998244353
    n, m, k = rli()
    F, I = func_1(n, MOD)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(k + 1):
        ans += func_2(n - 1, i, MOD, F, I) * m * pow(m - 1, n - 1 - i, MOD) % MOD
    print(ans % MOD)
```

This corrected code ensures that the loop iterates over the correct range, aligning with the problem's constraints and producing the correct output for all valid inputs.
