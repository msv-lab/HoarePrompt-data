Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from standard input.
   - It initializes the modulus \( MOD \) to 998244353, which is required for handling large numbers and ensuring the result fits within the specified constraints.

2. **Factorial and Inverse Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the factorials and their modular inverses up to \( n \). This is done using a loop and the `pow` function to compute the modular inverse.
   - The function returns two lists: `fact` (factorials modulo \( MOD \)) and `inv` (modular inverses of factorials modulo \( MOD \)).

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The function `func_2` calculates the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{k} \) modulo \( MOD \) using the precomputed factorials and their inverses.
   - It returns the result of the combination calculation.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The function `func_3` iterates over the range from \( n - k \) to \( n \) to calculate the number of ways to paint the blocks.
   - For each \( i \) in this range, it computes the number of ways to have exactly \( i - 1 \) pairs of adjacent blocks with the same color using the combination function `func_2`.
   - It multiplies this by the number of ways to choose the colors for the first block and the remaining blocks, and sums these values to get the total number of ways.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \( MOD \).

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Correct Handling of Constraints:**
  - The program handles the constraints \( 1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( 0 \leq K \leq N - 1 \) efficiently by precomputing factorials and their inverses.
  - It uses modular arithmetic to ensure the results fit within the specified modulus \( 998244353 \).

- **Correct Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm correctly counts the number of ways to paint the blocks under the given conditions.
  - It uses combinatorial methods to account for the different ways to arrange the blocks and the constraints on adjacent blocks.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints, using precomputation to reduce the complexity of the main loop.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the result modulo \( 998244353 \), as required by the problem description.

Given the above points, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore correct.
