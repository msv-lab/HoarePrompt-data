Final: **True**

Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Constraints**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ways to paint `N` blocks with `M` colors such that at most `K` pairs of adjacent blocks are the same color.
   - The constraints are \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq K \leq N - 1\).
   - The result must be printed modulo 998244353.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - Computes factorials and their modular inverses up to `n` modulo `q`.
     - The function initializes `fact` and `inv` lists with 1s.
     - The for loop updates `fact[i]` and `inv[i]` correctly.
     - The state after the loop is consistent with the problem's requirements.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - Computes the binomial coefficient modulo `q` using precomputed factorials and inverses.
     - The function returns the correct value for the binomial coefficient.
     - The function assumes that the indices `n`, `k`, and `n - k` are within bounds, which is valid given the problem constraints.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
     - Reads input values `n`, `m`, and `k`.
     - Calls `func_1` to get precomputed factorials and inverses.
     - Iterates over the range from `n - k` to `n` and computes the result using `func_2`.
     - The final result is printed modulo 998244353.
     - The state after the loop is consistent with the problem's requirements.

3. **Annotations and State**:
   - The annotations provide a clear and detailed explanation of the state of the program at different points.
   - The annotations confirm that the program maintains the required constraints and performs the necessary calculations correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The edge cases mentioned in the annotations (e.g., when `k` is 0 or `n-1`) are handled correctly by the loop in `func_3`.
   - The program does not access out-of-bounds indices, as the loop ensures that `i` is always within the valid range.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the solution for the problem of counting the number of ways to paint the blocks under the given constraints.
   - The annotations and state descriptions support the correctness of the program.
   - Therefore, the original assessment of **True** is accurate.
