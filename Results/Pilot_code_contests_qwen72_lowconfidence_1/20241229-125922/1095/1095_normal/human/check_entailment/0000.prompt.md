You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N blocks arranged in a row. Let us paint these blocks.

We will consider two ways to paint the blocks different if and only if there is a block painted in different colors in those two ways.

Find the number of ways to paint the blocks under the following conditions:

* For each block, use one of the M colors, Color 1 through Color M, to paint it. It is not mandatory to use all the colors.
* There may be at most K pairs of adjacent blocks that are painted in the same color.



Since the count may be enormous, print it modulo 998244353.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq K \leq N - 1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M K


Output

Print the answer.

Program:

from sys import stdin, stdout, setrecursionlimit
from functools import lru_cache
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, q):
    fact = [1 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    inv = [1 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % q
        inv[i] = pow(fact[i], q - 2, q)
    return (fact, inv)

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, k, q, F, I):
    return F[n] * (I[k] * I[n - k] % q) % q

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    MOD = 998244353
    (n, m, k) = rli()
    (F, I) = func_1(n, MOD)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - k, n + 1):
        ans += func_2(n - 1, i - 1, MOD, F, I) * m * pow(m - 1, i - 1, MOD) % MOD
    print(ans % MOD)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
