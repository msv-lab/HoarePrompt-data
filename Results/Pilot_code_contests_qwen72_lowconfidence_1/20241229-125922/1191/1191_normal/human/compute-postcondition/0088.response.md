To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key `ke` and `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`.
- `pr` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int` and must have at least two keys.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for ke in pr:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the keys in the `pr` dictionary. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `pr` is a `defaultdict` with at least two keys, after processing one key, there must still be at least one key left for the loop to continue.
   - The key `ke` that was processed in the previous iteration should no longer be considered for the current iteration.
   - The state of `rpr` and `n` does not directly affect the loop's continuation, but they remain part of the overall state.

### Updated State:
- `n` must still be at least 3 (unchanged).
- `rpr` remains a dictionary with at least one key `ke` and `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]` (unchanged).
- `pr` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int` and must have at least one key remaining (since it had at least two keys initially).

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key `ke` and `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int and must have at least one key remaining.**
