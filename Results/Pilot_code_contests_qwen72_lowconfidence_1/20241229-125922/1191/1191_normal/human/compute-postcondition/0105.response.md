Postcondition: ***`rpr` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a new defaultdict with default type int, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `(lag + 1) â‰  k`, `pr[ost, lag + 1]` is the maximum of its previous value (or 0 if it did not exist) and `rpr[ost, lag]`. If `ost` > 0, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value (or 0 if it did not exist) and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i]`.***
