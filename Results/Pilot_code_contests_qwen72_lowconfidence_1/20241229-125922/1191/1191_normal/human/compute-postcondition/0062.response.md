Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int, `(ost, lag)` is the first key-value pair in `rpr`, `lag + 1` is not equal to `k`, `pr[ost, lag + 1]` is the maximum of `pr[ost, lag + 1]` and `rpr[ost, lag]`. The current value of `ost` is greater than 0.***
