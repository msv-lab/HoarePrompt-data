The provided code snippet initializes an empty dictionary `rpr`. This action does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state (`n`, `pr`, `arr`, `k`, `i`). However, it changes the state of `rpr` from containing at least one key-value pair to being an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` is an empty dictionary, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int.**
