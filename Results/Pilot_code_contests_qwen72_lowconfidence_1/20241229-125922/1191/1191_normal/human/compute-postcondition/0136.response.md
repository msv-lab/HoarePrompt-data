To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200.
- `k` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.
- `i` is `n`.
- `rpr` is a dictionary containing the final key-value pairs computed from the loop, where each key is a tuple `(ost, lag)` and each value is the maximum value computed based on the conditions described in the loop.
- The length of `rpr` is greater than 0.
- `m` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for k in rpr:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the keys in the dictionary `rpr`.
- For the loop to execute, `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair.

### States to Adjust:
- The variable `k` is not the same as the `k` mentioned in the initial state. In the loop, `k` is a key from the dictionary `rpr`.
- The loop will execute if `rpr` has at least one key-value pair. This is already guaranteed by the given state (`the length of rpr is greater than 0`).

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`. The loop does not depend on `i`, but the initial state mentions `i` is `n`, which is not necessary for the loop to execute. Therefore, we can ignore `i` in the context of the loop's execution.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `k` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `rpr` is a dictionary containing the final key-value pairs computed from the loop, where each key is a tuple `(ost, lag)` and each value is the maximum value computed based on the conditions described in the loop, the length of `rpr` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `k` is a key in `rpr`**.
