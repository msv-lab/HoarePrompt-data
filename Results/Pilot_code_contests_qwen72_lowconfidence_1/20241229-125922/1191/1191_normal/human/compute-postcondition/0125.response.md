To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `rpr` is an empty dictionary.
- `pr` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `int` and contains updated key-value pairs based on certain conditions.
- `n` is an integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `arr` is a list of integers.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for ke in pr:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the keys in the `pr` dictionary.
- For the loop to execute, `pr` must contain at least one key-value pair.
- The other variables (`rpr`, `n`, `i`, and `arr`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they are part of the program state.

### Required Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop executes, `pr` must have at least one key-value pair.

### Final State:
- `rpr` is an empty dictionary.
- `pr` must contain at least one key-value pair.
- `n` is an integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `arr` is a list of integers.

State: **`rpr` is an empty dictionary, `pr` must contain at least one key-value pair, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers**
