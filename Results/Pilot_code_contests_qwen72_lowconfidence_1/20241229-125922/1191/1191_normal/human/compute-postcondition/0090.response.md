To determine the output state of the loop, we need to consider the initial state and how the loop modifies the variables over its iterations. Let's break it down step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `rpr` is an empty dictionary.
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int.

### Loop Code:
```python
for ke in pr:
    rpr[ke] = pr[ke]
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each key `ke` in the dictionary `pr`.
- For each key `ke`, it assigns the value of `pr[ke]` to `rpr[ke]`.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- If `pr` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `rpr` will remain an empty dictionary.
- If `pr` has at least one key, the loop will execute at least once, and `rpr` will have at least one key-value pair copied from `pr`.
- After the loop finishes, `rpr` will contain all the key-value pairs that were in `pr`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `rpr` is a dictionary containing all the key-value pairs from `pr`.
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int, and its content remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` is a dictionary containing all the key-value pairs from `pr`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int and remains unchanged.**
