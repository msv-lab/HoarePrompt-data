The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. This does not change the values of any variables, but it affects the flow of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input and must have at least one element
- `i` is 1
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0)
- `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k` and must have at least one more key-value pair to process

Since `continue` only affects the flow of the loop and does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input and must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0), `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k` and must have at least one more key-value pair to process.**
