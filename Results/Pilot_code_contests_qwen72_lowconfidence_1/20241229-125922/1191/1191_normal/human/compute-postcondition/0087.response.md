The line of code `rpr[ke] = pr[ke]` updates the value of `rpr[ke]` to be equal to `pr[ke]`. Given that initially `rpr[ke]` was already equal to `pr[ke]`, this operation does not change the value of `rpr[ke]`.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state except for the confirmation that the assignment has taken place.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key `ke` and `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int and must have at least two keys.**
