Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input and must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0), `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k`: if `k` > 1, `rpr` is `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`, if `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`. If `(lag + 1) == k` and `ost` > 0, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to the maximum of `pr[ost - 1, 0]` and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[1]`. If `(lag + 1) ≠ k` and `ost` > 0, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to the maximum of `pr[ost - 1, 0]` and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[1]`, and `pr[ost, lag + 1]` is updated to the maximum of `pr[ost, lag + 1]` and `rpr[ost, lag]`. If `ost` ≤ 0, no changes are made to `pr` or `rpr`.***
