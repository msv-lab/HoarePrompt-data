Postcondition: ***`rpr` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, and the next key-value pair `(ost, lag)` in `rpr` will be used in the next iteration. If `ost > 0`, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
