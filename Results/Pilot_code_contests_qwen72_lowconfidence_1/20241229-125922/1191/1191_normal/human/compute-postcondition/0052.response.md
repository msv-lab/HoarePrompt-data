The code snippet initializes `pr` as a `defaultdict` with default type `int`. This means that `pr` will now automatically initialize missing keys with the integer value `0`. The existing variables `n` and `rpr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int.**
