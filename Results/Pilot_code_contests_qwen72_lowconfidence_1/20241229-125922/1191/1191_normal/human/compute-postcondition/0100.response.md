Postcondition: ***`rpr` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a new defaultdict with default type int, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, and `lag + 1` is equal to `k`. If `ost` > 0, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to `max(pr[ost - 1, 0], rpr[ost, k - 1] + arr[n - 1])`. If `ost` â‰¤ 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.***
