The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables directly. Since the initial state specifies conditions about the variables and no changes are made to these variables by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` must contain at least three key-value pairs, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int, `(ost, lag)` is the third key-value pair in `rpr`.**
