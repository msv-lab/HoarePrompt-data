Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int, `(ost, lag)` is the first key-value pair in `rpr`. The current value of `lag` is such that `lag + 1` equals `k`. If `ost` is greater than 0, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to `max(pr[ost - 1, 0], rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i])`. If `ost` is less than or equal to 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
