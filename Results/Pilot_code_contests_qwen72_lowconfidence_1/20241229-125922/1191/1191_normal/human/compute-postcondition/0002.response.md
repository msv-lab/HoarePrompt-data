The code reads a single line from `sys.stdin`, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n`, `k`, and `x` respectively. The constraints given in the initial state ensure that the values read will conform to the specified ranges.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input line, such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, and a list `a` of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `sys.stdin` is a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data, `input` is now a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and returns it after stripping trailing newline and carriage return characters.**
