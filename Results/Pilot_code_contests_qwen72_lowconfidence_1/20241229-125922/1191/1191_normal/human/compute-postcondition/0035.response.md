The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop structure is explicitly shown in the given code snippet, the impact of `continue` is to terminate the current block of code execution (assuming this is part of a loop).

Since the `continue` statement does not alter any variable values or the state of the program except for controlling the flow within a loop, the variables remain unchanged. The specific details about the variables and their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input and must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0), and `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k` and must have at least one more key-value pair to process.**
