Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int, `(ost, lag)` is the second key-value pair in `rpr`. If `ost` > 0, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to `max(pr[ost - 1, 0], rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i])`. If `ost` is not greater than 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.***
