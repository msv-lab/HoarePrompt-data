The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 1, after the increment, `i` becomes 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `i` is 2, `rpr` is a dictionary containing all key-value pairs from `pr`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing the maximum values computed from the updates based on the conditions described above.**
