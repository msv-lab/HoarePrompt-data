The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow control within a loop.

Output State: **`rpr` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, and the next key-value pair `(ost, lag)` in `rpr` will be used in the next iteration.**
