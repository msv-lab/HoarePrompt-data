The code snippet updates the `pr` dictionary based on the current values of `ost`, `lag`, and the contents of the `rpr` dictionary. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Variables Affected**: `pr` is updated.
2. **Preconditions**:
   - `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input and must have at least one element.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0).
   - `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k`:
     - If `k` > 1, `rpr` is `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
     - If `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
   - `(lag + 1) ≠ k`.

3. **Code Execution**:
   - The key `(ost, lag + 1)` in `pr` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `rpr[ost, lag]`.
   - If `rpr[ost, lag]` exists, it will be used in the comparison.
   - If `rpr[ost, lag]` does not exist, the value remains unchanged.

4. **Updated Values**:
   - The value of `pr[ost, lag + 1]` is updated to `max(pr[ost, lag + 1], rpr[ost, lag])`.

5. **Output State**:
   - `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input and must have at least one element.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0), and `pr[ost, lag + 1]` is updated to `max(pr[ost, lag + 1], rpr[ost, lag])`.
   - `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k`:
     - If `k` > 1, `rpr` is `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
     - If `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
   - `(lag + 1) ≠ k`.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input and must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0), and `pr[ost, lag + 1]` is updated to `max(pr[ost, lag + 1], rpr[ost, lag])`, `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k`: if `k` > 1, `rpr` is `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`, if `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`, and `(lag + 1) ≠ k`.**
