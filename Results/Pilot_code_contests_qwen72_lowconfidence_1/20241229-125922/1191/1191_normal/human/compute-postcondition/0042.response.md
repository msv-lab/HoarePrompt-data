The code snippet `rpr = dict()` reinitializes the dictionary `rpr` to an empty dictionary, discarding its previous contents. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `arr`, `i`, and `pr`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `i` is 1, `rpr` is an empty dictionary, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing the maximum values computed from the updates based on the conditions described above.**
