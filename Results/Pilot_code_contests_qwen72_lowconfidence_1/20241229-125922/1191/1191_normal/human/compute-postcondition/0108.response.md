The code snippet updates the `pr` dictionary with a new key-value pair based on the current values of `ost`, `lag`, and `i`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which defaults to 0 since `pr` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int`) and the value of `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i]`.
- The value of `arr[i]` is added to `rpr[ost, lag]` and compared with the current value of `pr[ost - 1, 0]`.

Since the initial state specifies that `i` is `n-1`, the value of `arr[i]` is `arr[n-1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `rpr` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair.
- `pr` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int`.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to `max(pr[ost - 1, 0], rpr[ost, lag] + arr[n-1])`.

Output State: **`rpr` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is `max(pr[ost - 1, 0], rpr[ost, lag] + arr[n-1])`**.
