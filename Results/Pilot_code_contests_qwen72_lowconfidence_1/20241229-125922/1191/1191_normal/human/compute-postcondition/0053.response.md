To ensure the loop can execute, we need to verify the conditions based on the given state and the loop statement.

Given state:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair.
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int.

The loop statement:
```python
for (ost, lag) in rpr:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n` must be at least 3**: This condition is independent of the loop's execution and does not affect whether the loop will run. Therefore, this state does not need to be adjusted.
2. **`rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair**: For the loop to execute, `rpr` must have at least one key-value pair. This is a necessary condition for the loop to iterate.
3. **`pr` is a defaultdict with default type int**: This is a valid state and does not need to be adjusted. It ensures that `pr` can handle any new keys without raising an error.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be at least 3 (unchanged).
- `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair to ensure the loop executes.
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int (unchanged).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int, `(ost, lag)` is the first key-value pair in `rpr`**
