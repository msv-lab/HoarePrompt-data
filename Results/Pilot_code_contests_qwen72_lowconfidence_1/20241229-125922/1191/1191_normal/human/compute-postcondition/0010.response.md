To determine whether the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that both conditions in the `while` loop statement are met:

1. `i < n`
2. `len(rpr) > 0`

Let's break down the given state and the conditions:

### Given State:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.
- If `k` > 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
- If `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
- `i` is 1.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
1. **`i < n`**: 
   - Since `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, this condition will always be true as long as `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` or `n`.

2. **`len(rpr) > 0`**:
   - The length of `rpr` depends on the value of `k`.
   - If `k` > 1, `rpr` has two key-value pairs, so `len(rpr)` is 2.
   - If `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` has one key-value pair, so `len(rpr)` is 1.
   - In both cases, `len(rpr)` is greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed for `rpr`.

### Conclusion:
Since both conditions (`i < n` and `len(rpr) > 0`) are already satisfied with the given state, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input. If `k` > 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`. If `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`. `i` is 1.**
