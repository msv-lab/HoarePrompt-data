Functionality: ** The function reads input values `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then processes the list `arr` to compute a dictionary `rpr` that tracks certain states based on the values in `arr` and the constraints defined by `k` and `x`. The function iterates through the list `arr` and updates the dictionary `rpr` according to specific rules. After processing, it finds the maximum value in `rpr` and prints it if `rpr` is not empty; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `k`, `x`, and `arr` remaining unchanged, and the dictionary `rpr` containing the final computed key-value pairs. If `rpr` is not empty, the maximum value in `rpr` is printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed. **

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Empty Input List**: The function assumes that `n` is at least 1, so the list `arr` is never empty. If `n` were 0, the function would not work correctly.
- **Single Element List**: If `n` is 1, the function initializes `rpr` and immediately exits the loop, printing the value of `arr[0]` if `k` is 1, or 0 if `k` is greater than 1.
- **No Valid States**: If the conditions in the loop never allow any valid states to be added to `rpr`, the function will print `-1`.
- **Input Validation**: The function does not validate the input values to ensure they meet the specified constraints (e.g., `1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`). If the input values do not meet these constraints, the function may behave unexpectedly.
