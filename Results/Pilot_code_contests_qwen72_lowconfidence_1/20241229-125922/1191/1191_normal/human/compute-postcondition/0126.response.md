The code snippet `rpr[ke] = pr[ke]` assigns the value of `pr[ke]` to `rpr[ke]`. Since `pr` must contain at least one key-value pair and `rpr` is initially an empty dictionary, after this operation, `rpr` will contain at least one key-value pair, specifically the key-value pair from `pr` indexed by `ke`.

The values of `n`, `i`, and `arr` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`rpr` contains at least one key-value pair (specifically, `rpr[ke]` is set to `pr[ke]`), `pr` contains at least one key-value pair, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers**.
