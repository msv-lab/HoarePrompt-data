To determine the final state of the program after the loop completes, we need to consider the initial conditions and how the loop modifies the variables `pr` and `rpr` over multiple iterations. Let's break down the loop's behavior step by step and then generalize the final state.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.
- If `k` > 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
- If `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
- `i` is 1.
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0).

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the key-value pairs in `rpr`. For each key-value pair `(ost, lag)`, it performs the following operations:
1. If `lag + 1 == k` and `ost > 0`:
   - Update `pr[ost - 1, 0]` to the maximum of its current value and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i]`.
2. If `lag + 1 != k`:
   - Update `pr[ost, lag + 1]` to the maximum of its current value and `rpr[ost, lag]`.
   - If `ost > 0`, update `pr[ost - 1, 0]` to the maximum of its current value and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i]`.

### Final State After All Iterations:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state.
- `a` remains the same as in the initial state.
- `arr` remains the same as in the initial state.
- `i` remains 1 (since `i` is not modified within the loop).
- `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k`:
  - If `k` > 1, `rpr` starts with `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
  - If `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` starts with `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0), and after the loop, it contains the following:
  - For each `(ost, lag)` in `rpr`:
    - If `lag + 1 == k` and `ost > 0`, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[1]`.
    - If `lag + 1 != k`, `pr[ost, lag + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `rpr[ost, lag]`.
    - If `ost > 0`, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[1]`.

### Generalized Output State:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.
- `i` is 1.
- `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k`:
  - If `k` > 1, `rpr` is `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
  - If `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0), and after the loop, it contains the maximum values computed from the updates based on the conditions described above.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `i` is 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k`: if `k` > 1, `rpr` is `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`, if `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`, and `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing the maximum values computed from the updates based on the conditions described above.**
