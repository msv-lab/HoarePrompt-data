The code updates the value of `pr[ost, lag + 1]` to be the maximum of its current value (defaulting to 0 since `pr` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int`) and the value of `rpr[ost, lag]`.

- `pr` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int`, so `pr[ost, lag + 1]` starts as 0 if it hasn't been set before.
- `rpr[ost, lag]` is a value from the dictionary `rpr`.
- The value of `pr[ost, lag + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `rpr[ost, lag]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`rpr` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a new defaultdict with default type int, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `pr[ost, lag + 1]` is now `max(pr[ost, lag + 1], rpr[ost, lag])`, and the next key-value pair `(ost, lag)` in `rpr` will be used in the next iteration.**
