The code snippet initializes a dictionary `rpr` with two key-value pairs:
- The key `(x, 1)` is mapped to the value `0`.
- The key `(x - 1, 0)` is mapped to the value `arr[0]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.
- The current value of `k` is greater than 1.

After executing the code, the only change is the initialization of the dictionary `rpr`. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, the current value of `k` is greater than 1, `rpr = {(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`**
