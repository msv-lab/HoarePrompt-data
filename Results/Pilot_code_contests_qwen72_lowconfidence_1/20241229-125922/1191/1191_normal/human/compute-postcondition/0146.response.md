Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `k` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `i` is `n`, `rpr` is a dictionary containing the final key-value pairs computed from the loop, where each key is a tuple `(ost, lag)` and each value is the maximum value computed based on the conditions described in the loop. If the length of `rpr` is greater than 0, `k` is the last key processed in the iteration order of `rpr`, `m` is the maximum value among all values in `rpr`, and the value of `m` is printed. If the length of `rpr` is 0, `-1` has been printed.***
