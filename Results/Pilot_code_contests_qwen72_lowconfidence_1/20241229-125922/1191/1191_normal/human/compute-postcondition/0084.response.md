To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information:

- The state before the loop starts: `n` must be at least 3, `rpr` is an empty dictionary, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int.
- The loop iterates over the keys in the `pr` dictionary.

For the loop to execute, there must be at least one key in the `pr` dictionary. Since `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int, it can be modified to contain keys without explicitly setting values, but for the loop to actually iterate, there must be at least one key in `pr`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will only execute if `pr` has at least one key.
2. **Initial state**: `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int, which means it can generate integer values for non-existent keys, but it currently has no keys.
3. **Adjustment needed**: To ensure the loop executes, `pr` must have at least one key.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to include at least one key in `pr`.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` is an empty dictionary, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int and must have at least one key**
