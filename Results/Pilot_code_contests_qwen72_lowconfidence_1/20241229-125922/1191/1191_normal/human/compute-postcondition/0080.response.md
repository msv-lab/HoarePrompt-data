Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` must contain at least three key-value pairs, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int, `(ost, lag)` is the third key-value pair in `rpr`, `pr[ost, lag + 1]` is the maximum of `pr[ost, lag + 1]` (initially 0) and `rpr[ost, lag]`. If `ost` > 0, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to the maximum of `pr[ost - 1, 0]` (initially 0) and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i]`.***
