The code snippet initializes a dictionary `rpr` with a single key-value pair. The key is a tuple `(x - 1, 0)` and the value is the first element of the list `arr`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.
- `k` is exactly 1.

The key in the dictionary is `(x - 1, 0)`, and the value is `arr[0]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.
- `k` is exactly 1.
- `rpr` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.**
