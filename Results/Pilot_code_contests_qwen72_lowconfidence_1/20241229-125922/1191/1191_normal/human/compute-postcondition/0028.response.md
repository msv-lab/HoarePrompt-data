Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input and must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0). If `ost` > 0, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to \(\max(\text{current\_value}, \text{rpr\_value} + \text{arr[1]})\). In both cases, `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k` and must have at least one more key-value pair to process.***
