The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the flow control moves to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int, `(ost, lag)` is the first key-value pair in `rpr`. The current value of `lag` is such that `lag + 1` equals `k`. Additionally, `ost` is less than or equal to 0. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
