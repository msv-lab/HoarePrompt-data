The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state retains all the conditions from the initial state.

Output State: **`rpr` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a new defaultdict with default type int, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lag + 1` is equal to `k`, `ost` is less than or equal to 0, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
