To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if there are any keys in the dictionary `pr`. This means `pr` must contain at least one key-value pair.

2. **Initial State**: 
   - `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `rpr` is an empty dictionary.
   - `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing the maximum values computed from the updates based on the conditions described above.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `pr` must contain at least one key-value pair. Since `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0), it can contain keys even if they haven't been explicitly set, but they will have a value of 0 by default.
   - However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `pr` contains at least one key with a non-zero value, or at least one key with a value of 0 that is meaningful in the context of the loop.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `pr` contains at least one key. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `i` is 1, `rpr` is an empty dictionary, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing at least one key-value pair.**
