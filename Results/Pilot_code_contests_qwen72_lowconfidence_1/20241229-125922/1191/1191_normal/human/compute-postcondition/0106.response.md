Postcondition: ***`rpr` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a new defaultdict with default type int, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` is `n-1`. If `lag + 1` is equal to `k` and `ost` > 0, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to `max(pr[ost - 1, 0], rpr[ost, k - 1] + arr[n - 1])`. If `ost` ≤ 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `(lag + 1) ≠ k`, `pr[ost, lag + 1]` is the maximum of its previous value (or 0 if it did not exist) and `rpr[ost, lag]`. Additionally, if `ost` > 0, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value (or 0 if it did not exist) and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i]`.***
