Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input and must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0), `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k`: if `k` > 1, `rpr` is `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`, if `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`, and `(lag + 1)` is equal to `k`. Additionally, `ost` is greater than 0.***
