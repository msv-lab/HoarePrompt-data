The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. This means no changes occur to the variables mentioned in the initial state, except that the next iteration will proceed using the next key-value pair from `rpr`.

Output State: **`rpr` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a new defaultdict with default type int, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, and the next key-value pair `(ost, lag)` in `rpr` will be used in the next iteration.**
