The code `rpr[ke] = pr[ke]` updates the dictionary `rpr` by setting the value of the key `ke` to the value of `pr[ke]`. This means that the value of `rpr[ke]` now matches the value of `pr[ke]`.

Since the initial state specifies that `rpr` already contains at least one key-value pair where `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, and `ke` is the next key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet, this operation simply extends the synchronization between `rpr` and `pr` to include the new key `ke`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `arr`, `i`, `pr`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `i` is 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing at least two key-value pairs, `ke` is the next key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet.**
