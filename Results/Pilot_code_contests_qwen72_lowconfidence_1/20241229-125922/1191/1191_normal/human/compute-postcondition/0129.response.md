To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `rpr` contains at least one key-value pair (specifically, `rpr[ke]` is set to `pr[ke]`).
- `pr` contains at least two key-value pairs.
- `n` is an integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `arr` is a list of integers.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for ke in pr:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the keys in the dictionary `pr`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more keys in `pr` to iterate over.
2. **Current State**:
   - `pr` contains at least two key-value pairs.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `rpr` contains at least one key-value pair (specifically, `rpr[ke]` is set to `pr[ke]`).

### Adjusting the State:
- **`pr`**: Since the loop has already executed once, one key from `pr` has been processed. Therefore, `pr` must contain at least one more key for the loop to execute again.
- **`ke`**: The variable `ke` will take the value of the next key in `pr` for the next iteration.
- **Other Variables**: The variables `rpr`, `n`, `i`, and `arr` do not change based on the loop condition.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `pr` must contain at least one more key. The state of `ke` will be the next key in `pr`.

### Final State:
State: **`rpr` contains at least one key-value pair (specifically, `rpr[ke]` is set to `pr[ke]`), `pr` contains at least one key-value pair, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `ke` is the next key in `pr`**.
