The code redefines the `input` function to read a line from `sys.stdin`, strip it of trailing newline and carriage return characters, and return the result.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, and a list `a` of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `sys.stdin` is a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data, `input` is now a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and returns it after stripping trailing newline and carriage return characters.**
