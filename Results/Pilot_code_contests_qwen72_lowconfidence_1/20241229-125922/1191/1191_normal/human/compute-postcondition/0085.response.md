The value of `rpr[ke]` is set to the value of `pr[ke]`. Since `pr` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `int` and must have at least one key, `rpr` now contains at least one key-value pair, where the key is `ke` and the value is the same as the value of `pr[ke]`. The states of `n`, `rpr`, and `pr` are otherwise unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key `ke` and `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int and must have at least one key**
