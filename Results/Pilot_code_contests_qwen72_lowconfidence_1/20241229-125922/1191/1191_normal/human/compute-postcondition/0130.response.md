The code `rpr[ke] = pr[ke]` assigns the value of `pr[ke]` to `rpr[ke]`. Since `rpr[ke]` was already set to `pr[ke]` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `rpr[ke]`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`rpr` contains at least one key-value pair (specifically, `rpr[ke]` is set to `pr[ke]`), `pr` contains at least one key-value pair, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `ke` is the next key in `pr`**.
