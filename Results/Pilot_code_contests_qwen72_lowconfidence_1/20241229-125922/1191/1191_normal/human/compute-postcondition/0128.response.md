The code snippet `rpr[ke] = pr[ke]` assigns the value of `pr[ke]` to `rpr[ke]`. Given that `rpr` already contains at least one key-value pair (specifically, `rpr[ke]` is set to `pr[ke]`), this operation does not change the value of `rpr[ke]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`rpr` contains at least one key-value pair (specifically, `rpr[ke]` is set to `pr[ke]`), `pr` contains at least two key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers**.
