The value of `rpr[ke]` is updated to be the same as `pr[ke]`. Since the initial state already indicates that `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, this operation does not change the value of `rpr[ke]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key `ke` and `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int and must have at least one key remaining.**
