According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `pr`. The loop iterates over each key in `pr`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 3, `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key `ke` and `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int and must have at least one key.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another key in `pr` that has not been processed yet. Since `pr` must have at least one key for the first iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `pr` must have at least two keys.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key `ke` and `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int and must have at least two keys**
