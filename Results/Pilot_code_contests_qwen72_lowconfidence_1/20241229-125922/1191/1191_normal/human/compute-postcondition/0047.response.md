To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.
- `i` is 1.
- `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`.
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing at least two key-value pairs.
- `ke` is the next key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for ke in pr:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each key `ke` in the dictionary `pr`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet.

### Current State:
- `i` is 1.
- `ke` is the next key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The key `ke` must be updated to the next key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet.
- The state of `i` does not change because it is not involved in the loop condition or iteration.
- The state of `rpr` and `pr` remains the same as long as there are keys left to process in `pr`.

### New State:
Since the loop is iterating over the keys in `pr`, the next key `ke` must be the next unprocessed key in `pr`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `i` is 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing at least two key-value pairs, `ke` is the next key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet.**
