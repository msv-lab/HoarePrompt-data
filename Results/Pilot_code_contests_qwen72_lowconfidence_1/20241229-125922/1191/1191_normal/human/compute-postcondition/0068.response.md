The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of variables directly but affects the flow of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be at least 3
- `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int
- `(ost, lag)` is the second key-value pair in `rpr`

The `continue` statement will cause the program to skip the rest of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. However, since no specific loop context is provided, we assume this is part of a loop, and the variables remain unchanged except for the control flow.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int, `(ost, lag)` is the second key-value pair in `rpr`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
