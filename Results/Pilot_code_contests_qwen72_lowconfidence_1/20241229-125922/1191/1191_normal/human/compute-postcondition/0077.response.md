Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` must contain at least three key-value pairs, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int, `(ost, lag)` is the third key-value pair in `rpr`. If `ost > 0`, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to `max(pr[ost - 1, 0], rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i])`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
