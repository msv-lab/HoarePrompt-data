Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a defaultdict with default type int. For each key-value pair `(ost, lag)` in `rpr`: If `lag + 1 == k` and `ost > 0`, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is the maximum of its current value and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i]`. If `lag + 1 != k`, `pr[ost, lag + 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `rpr[ost, lag]`. Additionally, if `ost > 0`, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is the maximum of its current value and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i]`.**
