According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `pr`. The loop iterates over each key `ke` in `pr`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.
- `i` is 1.
- `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`.
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing at least one key-value pair.

For the loop to execute one more time, the key `ke` used in the last iteration must be different from the next key to be processed. Therefore, the next key must exist in `pr`.

State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `i` is 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing at least two key-value pairs, `ke` is the next key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet.**
