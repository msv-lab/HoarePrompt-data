To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will iterate over the items in the `rpr` dictionary. Let's break down the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.
- If `k` > 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
- If `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
- `i` is 1.
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (ost, lag) in rpr:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if the `rpr` dictionary is not empty. The contents of `rpr` depend on the value of `k`.
2. **Value of `k`**:
   - If `k` > 1, `rpr` contains two key-value pairs: `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.
   - If `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` contains one key-value pair: `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.

### Adjusted State:
For the loop to execute, `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair. This means:
- If `k` > 1, `rpr` must have the two key-value pairs.
- If `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` must have the single key-value pair.

Given the initial state, we need to ensure that:
- `k` is either greater than 1 or exactly 1.
- `arr` is not empty, so `arr[0]` is defined.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input and must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0), `rpr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs based on `k`: if `k` > 1, `rpr` is `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`, if `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.**
