The code snippet `rpr[ke] = pr[ke]` copies the value associated with the key `ke` from the `pr` dictionary to the `rpr` dictionary. The specific value of `ke` is not provided, but it is assumed to be a key that exists in the `pr` dictionary.

Here's the updated state:

- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.
- `i` is 1.
- `rpr` is now a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`.
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing at least one key-value pair.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `i` is 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing at least one key-value pair.**
