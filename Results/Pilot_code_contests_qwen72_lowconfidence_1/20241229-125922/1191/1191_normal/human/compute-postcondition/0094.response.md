To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given information:

1. **`rpr` Dictionary**: The loop iterates over the items in the `rpr` dictionary. For the loop to execute at least once, `rpr` must contain at least one key-value pair.

2. **`n` and `i`**: The values of `n` and `i` are mentioned but do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute. However, if `i` is `n-1`, it suggests that `n` must be at least 1 for `i` to be a non-negative integer. Since `i` is not directly used in the loop condition, we can focus on `rpr`.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed are:

- **`rpr` must have at least one key-value pair**: This ensures that the loop will iterate at least once.
- **`pr` is a new defaultdict with default type int**: This is already stated and does not need adjustment.
- **`n` must be at least 1**: This ensures that `i` is a non-negative integer, but since `i` is not directly used in the loop, this is more of a contextual requirement rather than a direct loop execution requirement.
- **`i` is `n-1`**: This is a given state and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`rpr` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a new defaultdict with default type int, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`**
