The code `rpr[ke] = pr[ke]` updates the dictionary `rpr` by assigning the value of `pr[ke]` to `rpr[ke]`. Since `ke` is the next key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet, this operation simply copies the value associated with `ke` from `pr` to `rpr`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input
- `i` is 1
- `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`
- `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing at least two key-value pairs
- `ke` is the next key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `i` is 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where `rpr[ke]` is equal to `pr[ke]`, `pr` is a defaultdict with default integer values (0) containing at least two key-value pairs, `ke` is the next key in `pr` that hasn't been processed yet**
