The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially `n-1`, after the increment, `i` becomes `n`. The other variables (`rpr`, `pr`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rpr` contains the same key-value pairs as `pr`, `pr` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int` and contains updated key-value pairs based on the conditions described, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers.**
