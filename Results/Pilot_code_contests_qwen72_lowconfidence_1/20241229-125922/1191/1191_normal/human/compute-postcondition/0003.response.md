The code snippet `arr = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin`, splits it into individual tokens, converts each token to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input line, such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200.
- A list `a` of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `sys.stdin` is a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data.
- `input` is a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and returns it after stripping trailing newline and carriage return characters.

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `arr` is populated with the integers from the next line of input.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.**
