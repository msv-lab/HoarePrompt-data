The line of code `pr = defaultdict(int)` reassigns the variable `pr` to a new `defaultdict` with the default type `int`. This means that `pr` is now a new dictionary that returns 0 for any key that does not exist in the dictionary.

However, this operation does not affect the existing `rpr` dictionary, which is a copy of the original `pr` before this reassignment and still contains all the key-value pairs from the original `pr`.

The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be at least 3, `rpr` is a dictionary containing all the key-value pairs from the original `pr` and must have a length greater than 0, `pr` is a new defaultdict with default type int, `i` is `n-1`**
