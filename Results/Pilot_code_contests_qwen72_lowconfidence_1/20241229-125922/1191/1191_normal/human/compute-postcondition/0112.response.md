The provided code snippet updates the value of `pr[ost - 1, 0]` to be the maximum of its current value (defaulting to 0 since `pr` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int`) and the value of `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i]`.

- `pr` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int`, so `pr[ost - 1, 0]` starts as 0 if it hasn't been set before.
- `rpr[ost, lag]` is a value from the dictionary `rpr`.
- `arr[i]` is a value from the list `arr` at index `i`.
- The value of `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`rpr` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `pr` is a new defaultdict with default type int, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `pr[ost - 1, 0]` is now `max(pr[ost - 1, 0], rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i])`.**
