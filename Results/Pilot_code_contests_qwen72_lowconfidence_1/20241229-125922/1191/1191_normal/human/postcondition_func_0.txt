The function reads input values `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then processes the list `arr` to compute a dictionary `rpr` that tracks certain states based on the values in `arr` and the constraints defined by `k` and `x`. The function iterates through the list `arr` and updates the dictionary `rpr` according to specific rules. After processing, it finds the maximum value in `rpr` and prints it if `rpr` is not empty; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `k`, `x`, and `arr` remaining unchanged, and the dictionary `rpr` containing the final computed key-value pairs. If `rpr` is not empty, the maximum value in `rpr` is printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed.
