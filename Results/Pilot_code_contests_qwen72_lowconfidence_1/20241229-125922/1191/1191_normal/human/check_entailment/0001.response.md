Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number of pictures Vova is ready to repost (`x`) is less than the minimum number of pictures required to ensure that each segment of at least `k` consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input:
5 3 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this case, `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and `x = 1`. According to the problem statement, Vova needs to repost at least one picture from every segment of 3 consecutive pictures. However, with only 1 repost, it is impossible to cover all segments of 3 consecutive pictures. The program should output `-1` in this case, but it does not handle this scenario correctly and may produce an incorrect result.
