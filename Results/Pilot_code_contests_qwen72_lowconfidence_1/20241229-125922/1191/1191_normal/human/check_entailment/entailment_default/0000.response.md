Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the code is considered correct:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The code reads the input values `n`, `k`, and `x` and the list of integers `arr`.
   - It initializes the dictionary `rpr` to track the states based on the constraints.

2. **State Tracking**:
   - The dictionary `rpr` is used to keep track of the possible states and their corresponding maximum sums.
   - The keys in `rpr` are tuples `(ost, lag)`, where `ost` is the remaining number of pictures to be reposted, and `lag` is the number of consecutive pictures without a repost.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The code iterates through the list `arr` and updates the dictionary `rpr` based on the current state and the beauty value of the current picture.
   - For each state, it considers two possibilities:
     - Not reposting the current picture, which increments the `lag`.
     - Reposting the current picture, which decreases `ost` and resets `lag`.

4. **Termination and Result**:
   - After processing all the pictures, the code checks if there are any valid states left in `rpr`.
   - If there are valid states, it finds the maximum value among them and prints it.
   - If there are no valid states, it prints `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1, which means every picture must be reposted.
   - It also handles cases where it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, returning `-1` appropriately.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the code appears to handle all potential cases correctly. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the maximum sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is calculated while satisfying the constraints. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
