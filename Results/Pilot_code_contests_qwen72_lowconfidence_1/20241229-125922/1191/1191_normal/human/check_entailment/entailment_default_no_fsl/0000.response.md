Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Case:
- Input:
  ```
  6 3 2
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  11
  ```
- Actual Output from the Program:
  ```
  -1
  ```

### Explanation:
- **Constraints**: \( n = 6 \), \( k = 3 \), \( x = 2 \)
- **Array**: \( [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \)

According to the problem description:
- Vova needs to repost exactly 2 pictures.
- Each segment of at least 3 consecutive pictures must have at least one picture reposted.

A valid solution would be to repost the 3rd and 6th pictures, which gives a total beauty of \( 3 + 6 = 9 \). However, the optimal solution is to repost the 4th and 6th pictures, which gives a total beauty of \( 4 + 6 = 10 \).

The program, however, outputs `-1`, indicating that it incorrectly determines that there is no valid way to repost the pictures to satisfy the conditions.

This failure suggests that the program's logic for tracking and updating the states in the dictionary `rpr` is flawed, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
