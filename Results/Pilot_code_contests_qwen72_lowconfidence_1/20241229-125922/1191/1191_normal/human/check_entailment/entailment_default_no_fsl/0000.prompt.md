You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraints.

Vova likes pictures with kittens. The news feed in the social network he uses can be represented as an array of n consecutive pictures (with kittens, of course). Vova likes all these pictures, but some are more beautiful than the others: the i-th picture has beauty a_i.

Vova wants to repost exactly x pictures in such a way that: 

  * each segment of the news feed of at least k consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted by Vova; 
  * the sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is maximum possible. 



For example, if k=1 then Vova has to repost all the pictures in the news feed. If k=2 then Vova can skip some pictures, but between every pair of consecutive pictures Vova has to repost at least one of them.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described above, or say that there is no way to satisfy all conditions.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, k and x (1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200) — the number of pictures in the news feed, the minimum length of segment with at least one repost in it and the number of pictures Vova is ready to repost.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the beauty of the i-th picture.

Output

Print -1 if there is no way to repost some pictures to satisfy all the conditions in the problem statement.

Otherwise print one integer — the maximum sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described in the problem statement.

                if ost > 0:
                    pr[ost - 1, 0] = max(pr[ost - 1, 0], rpr[ost, lag] + arr[i])
        rpr = dict()
        for ke in pr:
            rpr[ke] = pr[ke]
        i += 1
    if len(rpr):
        m = 0
        for k in rpr:
            m = max(m, rpr[k])
        print(m)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Output hints: The function reads input values `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then processes the list `arr` to compute a dictionary `rpr` that tracks certain states based on the values in `arr` and the constraints defined by `k` and `x`. The function iterates through the list `arr` and updates the dictionary `rpr` according to specific rules. After processing, it finds the maximum value in `rpr` and prints it if `rpr` is not empty; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `k`, `x`, and `arr` remaining unchanged, and the dictionary `rpr` containing the final computed key-value pairs. If `rpr` is not empty, the maximum value in `rpr` is printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
