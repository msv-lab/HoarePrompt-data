You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraints.

Vova likes pictures with kittens. The news feed in the social network he uses can be represented as an array of n consecutive pictures (with kittens, of course). Vova likes all these pictures, but some are more beautiful than the others: the i-th picture has beauty a_i.

Vova wants to repost exactly x pictures in such a way that: 

  * each segment of the news feed of at least k consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted by Vova; 
  * the sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is maximum possible. 



For example, if k=1 then Vova has to repost all the pictures in the news feed. If k=2 then Vova can skip some pictures, but between every pair of consecutive pictures Vova has to repost at least one of them.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described above, or say that there is no way to satisfy all conditions.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, k and x (1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200) — the number of pictures in the news feed, the minimum length of segment with at least one repost in it and the number of pictures Vova is ready to repost.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the beauty of the i-th picture.

Output

Print -1 if there is no way to repost some pictures to satisfy all the conditions in the problem statement.

Otherwise print one integer — the maximum sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described in the problem statement.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
