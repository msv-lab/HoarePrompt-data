You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraints.

Vova likes pictures with kittens. The news feed in the social network he uses can be represented as an array of n consecutive pictures (with kittens, of course). Vova likes all these pictures, but some are more beautiful than the others: the i-th picture has beauty a_i.

Vova wants to repost exactly x pictures in such a way that: 

  * each segment of the news feed of at least k consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted by Vova; 
  * the sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is maximum possible. 



For example, if k=1 then Vova has to repost all the pictures in the news feed. If k=2 then Vova can skip some pictures, but between every pair of consecutive pictures Vova has to repost at least one of them.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described above, or say that there is no way to satisfy all conditions.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, k and x (1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200) — the number of pictures in the news feed, the minimum length of segment with at least one repost in it and the number of pictures Vova is ready to repost.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the beauty of the i-th picture.

Output

Print -1 if there is no way to repost some pictures to satisfy all the conditions in the problem statement.

Otherwise print one integer — the maximum sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described in the problem statement.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number of pictures Vova is ready to repost (`x`) is less than the minimum number of pictures required to ensure that each segment of at least `k` consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input:
5 3 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this case, `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and `x = 1`. According to the problem statement, Vova needs to repost at least one picture from every segment of 3 consecutive pictures. However, with only 1 repost, it is impossible to cover all segments of 3 consecutive pictures. The program should output `-1` in this case, but it does not handle this scenario correctly and may produce an incorrect result.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the following:
        #
        #1. **Initial State**: 
        #   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200
        #   - `k` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n
        #   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
        #   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input
        #   - `rpr` is a dictionary containing the final key-value pairs computed from the loop, where each key is a tuple `(ost, lag)` and each value is the maximum value computed based on the conditions described in the loop, and the length of `rpr` is greater than 0
        #   - `m` is 0
        #
        #2. **Loop Code**:
        #   ```python
        #   for k in rpr:
        #       m = max(m, rpr[k])
        #   ```
        #
        #3. **Output State After All Iterations**:
        #   - The loop iterates over each key `k` in the dictionary `rpr`.
        #   - For each key `k`, the value `rpr[k]` is compared to the current value of `m`, and `m` is updated to the maximum of these two values.
        #   - This process continues until all keys in `rpr` have been processed.
        #
        #Given the above, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
        #
        #- `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200
        #- `k` is the last key processed in the iteration order of `rpr`
        #- `x` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n
        #- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
        #- `arr` remains a list of integers read from the next line of input
        #- `rpr` remains a dictionary containing the final key-value pairs computed from the loop, where each key is a tuple `(ost, lag)` and each value is the maximum value computed based on the conditions described in the loop, and the length of `rpr` is greater than 0
        #- `m` is the maximum value among all values in `rpr`
        #
        #Therefore, the output state is:
        #**`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `k` is the last key processed in the iteration order of `rpr`, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `rpr` is a dictionary containing the final key-value pairs computed from the loop, where each key is a tuple `(ost, lag)` and each value is the maximum value computed based on the conditions described in the loop, the length of `rpr` is greater than 0, `m` is the maximum value among all values in `rpr`**.
        print(m)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `k` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `i` is `n`, `rpr` is a dictionary containing the final key-value pairs computed from the loop, where each key is a tuple `(ost, lag)` and each value is the maximum value computed based on the conditions described in the loop. If the length of `rpr` is greater than 0, `k` is the last key processed in the iteration order of `rpr`, `m` is the maximum value among all values in `rpr`, and the value of `m` is printed. If the length of `rpr` is 0, `-1` has been printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
