You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraints.

Vova likes pictures with kittens. The news feed in the social network he uses can be represented as an array of n consecutive pictures (with kittens, of course). Vova likes all these pictures, but some are more beautiful than the others: the i-th picture has beauty a_i.

Vova wants to repost exactly x pictures in such a way that: 

  * each segment of the news feed of at least k consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted by Vova; 
  * the sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is maximum possible. 



For example, if k=1 then Vova has to repost all the pictures in the news feed. If k=2 then Vova can skip some pictures, but between every pair of consecutive pictures Vova has to repost at least one of them.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described above, or say that there is no way to satisfy all conditions.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, k and x (1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200) — the number of pictures in the news feed, the minimum length of segment with at least one repost in it and the number of pictures Vova is ready to repost.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the beauty of the i-th picture.

Output

Print -1 if there is no way to repost some pictures to satisfy all the conditions in the problem statement.

Otherwise print one integer — the maximum sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described in the problem statement.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number of pictures Vova is ready to repost (`x`) is less than the minimum number of pictures required to ensure that each segment of at least `k` consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input:
5 3 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this case, `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and `x = 1`. According to the problem statement, Vova needs to repost at least one picture from every segment of 3 consecutive pictures. However, with only 1 repost, it is impossible to cover all segments of 3 consecutive pictures. The program should output `-1` in this case, but it does not handle this scenario correctly and may produce an incorrect result.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads input values `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then processes the list `arr` to compute a dictionary `rpr` that tracks certain states based on the values in `arr` and the constraints defined by `k` and `x`. The function iterates through the list `arr` and updates the dictionary `rpr` according to specific rules. After processing, it finds the maximum value in `rpr` and prints it if `rpr` is not empty; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `k`, `x`, and `arr` remaining unchanged, and the dictionary `rpr` containing the final computed key-value pairs. If `rpr` is not empty, the maximum value in `rpr` is printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
