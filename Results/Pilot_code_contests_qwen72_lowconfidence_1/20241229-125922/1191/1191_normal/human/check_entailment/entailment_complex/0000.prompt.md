You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraints.

Vova likes pictures with kittens. The news feed in the social network he uses can be represented as an array of n consecutive pictures (with kittens, of course). Vova likes all these pictures, but some are more beautiful than the others: the i-th picture has beauty a_i.

Vova wants to repost exactly x pictures in such a way that: 

  * each segment of the news feed of at least k consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted by Vova; 
  * the sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is maximum possible. 



For example, if k=1 then Vova has to repost all the pictures in the news feed. If k=2 then Vova can skip some pictures, but between every pair of consecutive pictures Vova has to repost at least one of them.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described above, or say that there is no way to satisfy all conditions.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, k and x (1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200) — the number of pictures in the news feed, the minimum length of segment with at least one repost in it and the number of pictures Vova is ready to repost.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the beauty of the i-th picture.

Output

Print -1 if there is no way to repost some pictures to satisfy all the conditions in the problem statement.

Otherwise print one integer — the maximum sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described in the problem statement.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and x are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n ≤ 200, and a list a of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

    arr = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]

If `k` > 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: `{(x, 1): 0, (x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`. If `k` is exactly 1, `rpr` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `{(x - 1, 0): arr[0]}`.

                else:
                    continue
            else:
                pr[ost, lag + 1] = max(pr[ost, lag + 1], rpr[ost, lag])
                if ost > 0:

        m = 0
        for k in rpr:
            m = max(m, rpr[k])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the following:
        #
        #1. **Initial State**: 
        #   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200
        #   - `k` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n
        #   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
        #   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input
        #   - `rpr` is a dictionary containing the final key-value pairs computed from the loop, where each key is a tuple `(ost, lag)` and each value is the maximum value computed based on the conditions described in the loop, and the length of `rpr` is greater than 0
        #   - `m` is 0
        #
        #2. **Loop Code**:
        #   ```python
        #   for k in rpr:
        #       m = max(m, rpr[k])
        #   ```
        #
        #3. **Output State After All Iterations**:
        #   - The loop iterates over each key `k` in the dictionary `rpr`.
        #   - For each key `k`, the value `rpr[k]` is compared to the current value of `m`, and `m` is updated to the maximum of these two values.
        #   - This process continues until all keys in `rpr` have been processed.
        #
        #Given the above, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
        #
        #- `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200
        #- `k` is the last key processed in the iteration order of `rpr`
        #- `x` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n
        #- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
        #- `arr` remains a list of integers read from the next line of input
        #- `rpr` remains a dictionary containing the final key-value pairs computed from the loop, where each key is a tuple `(ost, lag)` and each value is the maximum value computed based on the conditions described in the loop, and the length of `rpr` is greater than 0
        #- `m` is the maximum value among all values in `rpr`
        #
        #Therefore, the output state is:
        #**`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `k` is the last key processed in the iteration order of `rpr`, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `rpr` is a dictionary containing the final key-value pairs computed from the loop, where each key is a tuple `(ost, lag)` and each value is the maximum value computed based on the conditions described in the loop, the length of `rpr` is greater than 0, `m` is the maximum value among all values in `rpr`**.
        print(m)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `k` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `i` is `n`, `rpr` is a dictionary containing the final key-value pairs computed from the loop, where each key is a tuple `(ost, lag)` and each value is the maximum value computed based on the conditions described in the loop. If the length of `rpr` is greater than 0, `k` is the last key processed in the iteration order of `rpr`, `m` is the maximum value among all values in `rpr`, and the value of `m` is printed. If the length of `rpr` is 0, `-1` has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then processes the list `arr` to compute a dictionary `rpr` that tracks certain states based on the values in `arr` and the constraints defined by `k` and `x`. The function iterates through the list `arr` and updates the dictionary `rpr` according to specific rules. After processing, it finds the maximum value in `rpr` and prints it if `rpr` is not empty; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `k`, `x`, and `arr` remaining unchanged, and the dictionary `rpr` containing the final computed key-value pairs. If `rpr` is not empty, the maximum value in `rpr` is printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
