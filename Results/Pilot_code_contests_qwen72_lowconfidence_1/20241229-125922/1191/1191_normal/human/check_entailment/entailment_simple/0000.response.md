Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input values `n`, `k`, and `x` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of beauty values `arr` from the second line.
   - These inputs are handled correctly and stored in appropriate variables.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a dictionary `rpr` to keep track of the maximum beauty sums for different states.
   - If `k > 1`, it initializes `rpr` with two key-value pairs: `(x, 1): 0` and `(x - 1, 0): arr[0]`.
   - If `k == 1`, it initializes `rpr` with a single key-value pair: `(x - 1, 0): arr[0]`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - The program iterates through the pictures from index 1 to `n-1` (since the first picture is already considered in the initialization).
   - For each picture, it updates the dictionary `rpr` to keep track of the maximum beauty sums for different states.
   - It ensures that each segment of at least `k` consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted.
   - It also ensures that the total number of reposted pictures does not exceed `x`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all pictures, the program checks if there are any valid states left in `rpr`.
   - If there are valid states, it finds the maximum beauty sum and prints it.
   - If there are no valid states, it prints `-1`.

### Why the Program is Correct:
- **Segment Condition**: The program ensures that each segment of at least `k` consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted by using the `lag` variable to track the number of consecutive pictures without a repost.
- **Repost Limit**: The program ensures that the total number of reposts does not exceed `x` by using the `ost` variable to track the remaining number of reposts.
- **Maximum Beauty Sum**: The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum beauty sum for different states, ensuring that the final output is the maximum possible sum of beauty values of reposted pictures.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where it is impossible to satisfy the conditions (e.g., when `k == 1` and `x < n`).

Given the above points, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
