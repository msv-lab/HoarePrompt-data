You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a of length 2n. Consider a partition of array a into two subsequences p and q of length n each (each element of array a should be in exactly one subsequence: either in p or in q).

Let's sort p in non-decreasing order, and q in non-increasing order, we can denote the sorted versions by x and y, respectively. Then the cost of a partition is defined as f(p, q) = ∑_{i = 1}^n |x_i - y_i|.

Find the sum of f(p, q) over all correct partitions of array a. Since the answer might be too big, print its remainder modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150 000).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of array a.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the problem, modulo 998244353.

Note

Two partitions of an array are considered different if the sets of indices of elements included in the subsequence p are different.

In the first example, there are two correct partitions of the array a:

  1. p = [1], q = [4], then x = [1], y = [4], f(p, q) = |1 - 4| = 3; 
  2. p = [4], q = [1], then x = [4], y = [1], f(p, q) = |4 - 1| = 3. 



In the second example, there are six valid partitions of the array a: 

  1. p = [2, 1], q = [2, 1] (elements with indices 1 and 2 in the original array are selected in the subsequence p); 
  2. p = [2, 2], q = [1, 1]; 
  3. p = [2, 1], q = [1, 2] (elements with indices 1 and 4 are selected in the subsequence p); 
  4. p = [1, 2], q = [2, 1]; 
  5. p = [1, 1], q = [2, 2]; 
  6. p = [2, 1], q = [2, 1] (elements with indices 3 and 4 are selected in the subsequence p). 
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    mod = 998244353
    a.sort()
    firsum = 0
    secsum = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i < n:
            firsum += a[i]
        else:
            secsum += a[i]
    k = abs(secsum - firsum) % mod
    fac = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, 2 * n + 1):
        fac.append(fac[-1] * i % mod)
    rr = fac[n] ** 2 % mod
    g = pow(rr, mod - 2, mod)
    print(k * (fac[2 * n] * g % mod) % mod)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
