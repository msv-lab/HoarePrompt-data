Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The program calculates the absolute difference between the sum of the first `n` elements and the sum of the last `n` elements of the sorted array. However, the problem requires calculating the sum of \( |x_i - y_i| \) for each pair of elements from the sorted subsequences `p` and `q`.

2. **Combinatorial Factor**: The program correctly calculates the combinatorial factor using factorials and modular inverses, but it incorrectly applies this factor to the result. The cost calculation should involve the sum of absolute differences, not just the difference between sums.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when all elements in the array are the same, the cost should be zero, but the current implementation might not yield this result.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:
- Input: `2 1 2 2 1`
- Expected Output: `12`

The correct approach would be to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Calculate the sum of \( |a[i] - a[2n - i - 1]| \) for \( i = 0 \) to \( n-1 \).
3. Multiply this sum by the combinatorial factor \( \frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2} \) modulo 998244353.

The current implementation does not perform these steps correctly, leading to incorrect results for many cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
