You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a of length 2n. Consider a partition of array a into two subsequences p and q of length n each (each element of array a should be in exactly one subsequence: either in p or in q).

Let's sort p in non-decreasing order, and q in non-increasing order, we can denote the sorted versions by x and y, respectively. Then the cost of a partition is defined as f(p, q) = ∑_{i = 1}^n |x_i - y_i|.

Find the sum of f(p, q) over all correct partitions of array a. Since the answer might be too big, print its remainder modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150 000).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of array a.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the problem, modulo 998244353.

Note

Two partitions of an array are considered different if the sets of indices of elements included in the subsequence p are different.

In the first example, there are two correct partitions of the array a:

  1. p = [1], q = [4], then x = [1], y = [4], f(p, q) = |1 - 4| = 3; 
  2. p = [4], q = [1], then x = [4], y = [1], f(p, q) = |4 - 1| = 3. 



In the second example, there are six valid partitions of the array a: 

  1. p = [2, 1], q = [2, 1] (elements with indices 1 and 2 in the original array are selected in the subsequence p); 
  2. p = [2, 2], q = [1, 1]; 
  3. p = [2, 1], q = [1, 2] (elements with indices 1 and 4 are selected in the subsequence p); 
  4. p = [1, 2], q = [2, 1]; 
  5. p = [1, 1], q = [2, 2]; 
  6. p = [2, 1], q = [2, 1] (elements with indices 3 and 4 are selected in the subsequence p). 
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    mod = 998244353
    a.sort()
    firsum = 0
    secsum = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i < n:
            firsum += a[i]
        else:
            secsum += a[i]
    k = abs(secsum - firsum) % mod
    fac = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, 2 * n + 1):
        fac.append(fac[-1] * i % mod)
    rr = fac[n] ** 2 % mod
    g = pow(rr, mod - 2, mod)
    print(k * (fac[2 * n] * g % mod) % mod)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the sum of \( f(p, q) \) over all correct partitions of the array \( a \).

### Issue Analysis:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `k`**:
   - The program calculates \( k \) as \( |secsum - firsum| \), where \( firsum \) is the sum of the first \( n \) elements of the sorted array \( a \), and \( secsum \) is the sum of the last \( n \) elements of the sorted array \( a \).
   - However, the problem requires the sum of \( |x_i - y_i| \) for all valid partitions, not just the difference between the sums of the two halves.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Combinatorial Factor**:
   - The program multiplies \( k \) by the combinatorial factor \( \frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2} \), which is the number of ways to choose \( n \) elements out of \( 2n \) elements.
   - This is incorrect because the sum of \( f(p, q) \) over all partitions is not simply the product of \( k \) and the combinatorial factor.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
2
1 2 3 4
```
- The correct partitions and their costs are:
  - \( p = [1, 2], q = [3, 4] \): \( x = [1, 2], y = [4, 3] \), \( f(p, q) = |1-4| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4 \)
  - \( p = [1, 3], q = [2, 4] \): \( x = [1, 3], y = [4, 2] \), \( f(p, q) = |1-4| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 \)
  - \( p = [1, 4], q = [2, 3] \): \( x = [1, 4], y = [3, 2] \), \( f(p, q) = |1-3| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4 \)
  - \( p = [2, 3], q = [1, 4] \): \( x = [2, 3], y = [4, 1] \), \( f(p, q) = |2-4| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4 \)
  - \( p = [2, 4], q = [1, 3] \): \( x = [2, 4], y = [3, 1] \), \( f(p, q) = |2-3| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 \)
  - \( p = [3, 4], q = [1, 2] \): \( x = [3, 4], y = [2, 1] \), \( f(p, q) = |3-2| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 \)

- The total sum of \( f(p, q) \) is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 \).

However, the program calculates \( k \) as \( |(1+2) - (3+4)| = |3 - 7| = 4 \), and then multiplies it by the combinatorial factor, resulting in \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \), which is coincidentally correct but for the wrong reason.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the calculation of \( f(p, q) \) for all partitions, and thus it is incorrect. The issue lies in the incorrect calculation of \( k \) and the misunderstanding of the combinatorial factor.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 150 000, and a is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = input()
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    mod = 998244353
    a.sort()
    firsum = 0
    secsum = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i < n:
            firsum += a[i]
        else:
            secsum += a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`.
    k = abs(secsum - firsum) % mod
    fac = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, 2 * n + 1):
        fac.append(fac[-1] * i % mod)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`, `fac` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is the factorial of its index modulo `mod`, `i` is `2 * n + 1`.
    rr = fac[n] ** 2 % mod
    g = pow(rr, mod - 2, mod)
    print(k * (fac[2 * n] * g % mod) % mod)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000) and a list `a` of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) from standard input. It then sorts the list `a`, calculates the sum of the first `n` elements (`firsum`) and the sum of the last `n` elements (`secsum`). The function computes the absolute difference between `secsum` and `firsum`, takes the result modulo 998244353, and stores it in `k`. It also computes the factorial of each number from 0 to 2n (modulo 998244353) and stores these values in a list `fac`. The function then calculates the square of the factorial of `n` (modulo 998244353), finds its modular inverse, and uses these values to compute a final result which is printed to standard output. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include handling very large inputs efficiently to avoid performance issues.
