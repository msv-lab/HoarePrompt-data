You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a of length 2n. Consider a partition of array a into two subsequences p and q of length n each (each element of array a should be in exactly one subsequence: either in p or in q).

Let's sort p in non-decreasing order, and q in non-increasing order, we can denote the sorted versions by x and y, respectively. Then the cost of a partition is defined as f(p, q) = ∑_{i = 1}^n |x_i - y_i|.

Find the sum of f(p, q) over all correct partitions of array a. Since the answer might be too big, print its remainder modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150 000).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of array a.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the problem, modulo 998244353.

Note

Two partitions of an array are considered different if the sets of indices of elements included in the subsequence p are different.

In the first example, there are two correct partitions of the array a:

  1. p = [1], q = [4], then x = [1], y = [4], f(p, q) = |1 - 4| = 3; 
  2. p = [4], q = [1], then x = [4], y = [1], f(p, q) = |4 - 1| = 3. 



In the second example, there are six valid partitions of the array a: 

  1. p = [2, 1], q = [2, 1] (elements with indices 1 and 2 in the original array are selected in the subsequence p); 
  2. p = [2, 2], q = [1, 1]; 
  3. p = [2, 1], q = [1, 2] (elements with indices 1 and 4 are selected in the subsequence p); 
  4. p = [1, 2], q = [2, 1]; 
  5. p = [1, 1], q = [2, 2]; 
  6. p = [2, 1], q = [2, 1] (elements with indices 3 and 4 are selected in the subsequence p). 
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    mod = 998244353
    a.sort()
    firsum = 0
    secsum = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i < n:
            firsum += a[i]
        else:
            secsum += a[i]
    k = abs(secsum - firsum) % mod
    fac = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, 2 * n + 1):
        fac.append(fac[-1] * i % mod)
    rr = fac[n] ** 2 % mod
    g = pow(rr, mod - 2, mod)
    print(k * (fac[2 * n] * g % mod) % mod)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the sum of `f(p, q)` over all possible partitions of the array `a`. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the program calculates the result using factorials and modular inverses. The program incorrectly computes the factorial of `n` and then squares it, but it does not correctly account for the total number of partitions and their contributions to the final result.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
2
1 2 3 4
```
Expected output:
```
20
```
The program will output a different value because it incorrectly computes the result by not properly handling the combinations of partitions and their contributions.

### Explanation of the Expected Output:
For the input `2 1 2 3 4`, the possible partitions and their corresponding `f(p, q)` values are:
1. \( p = [1, 2] \), \( q = [3, 4] \) → \( x = [1, 2] \), \( y = [4, 3] \) → \( f(p, q) = |1-4| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4 \)
2. \( p = [1, 3] \), \( q = [2, 4] \) → \( x = [1, 3] \), \( y = [4, 2] \) → \( f(p, q) = |1-4| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 \)
3. \( p = [1, 4] \), \( q = [2, 3] \) → \( x = [1, 4] \), \( y = [3, 2] \) → \( f(p, q) = |1-3| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4 \)
4. \( p = [2, 3] \), \( q = [1, 4] \) → \( x = [2, 3] \), \( y = [4, 1] \) → \( f(p, q) = |2-4| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4 \)
5. \( p = [2, 4] \), \( q = [1, 3] \) → \( x = [2, 4] \), \( y = [3, 1] \) → \( f(p, q) = |2-3| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 \)
6. \( p = [3, 4] \), \( q = [1, 2] \) → \( x = [3, 4] \), \( y = [2, 1] \) → \( f(p, q) = |3-2| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 \)

Sum of all \( f(p, q) \) values: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 \)

However, the program will compute a different value due to the incorrect handling of the factorial and modular inverse calculations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000) and a list `a` of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) from standard input. It then sorts the list `a`, calculates the sum of the first `n` elements (`firsum`) and the sum of the last `n` elements (`secsum`). The function computes the absolute difference between `secsum` and `firsum`, takes the result modulo 998244353, and stores it in `k`. It also computes the factorial of each number from 0 to 2n (modulo 998244353) and stores these values in a list `fac`. The function then calculates the square of the factorial of `n` (modulo 998244353), finds its modular inverse, and uses these values to compute a final result which is printed to standard output. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include handling very large inputs efficiently to avoid performance issues.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
