Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost Function:**
   - The problem description requires calculating the sum of \( f(p, q) \) over all possible partitions of the array \( a \). The cost function \( f(p, q) \) is defined as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i| \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are the sorted versions of \( p \) and \( q \) respectively.
   - The program calculates the sum of the first \( n \) elements and the sum of the last \( n \) elements of the sorted array \( a \), and then computes the absolute difference between these sums. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the specific pairs \( (x_i, y_i) \) required by the cost function.

2. **Factorial and Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the factorial of numbers up to \( 2n \) and uses it to compute the combinatorial factor for the number of partitions. However, the way it combines these results to compute the final answer is incorrect.
   - The program computes \( k \) as \( \text{abs}(secsum - firsum) \% mod \), which is not the correct way to compute the sum of \( f(p, q) \) over all partitions. The correct approach involves summing \( |a_i - a_{2n+1-i}| \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) and then multiplying by the number of ways to choose \( n \) elements out of \( 2n \).

3. **Combinatorial Factor:**
   - The combinatorial factor \( \binom{2n}{n} \) is correctly computed using factorials and modular inverses. However, the final result is not correctly combined with the cost function.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the following steps should be followed:
1. Sort the array \( a \).
2. Compute the sum of \( |a_i - a_{2n+1-i}| \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).
3. Compute the combinatorial factor \( \binom{2n}{n} \) using factorials and modular inverses.
4. Multiply the sum from step 2 by the combinatorial factor from step 3 and take the result modulo 998244353.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required algorithm to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
