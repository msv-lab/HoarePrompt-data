Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem description. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of the first `n` elements and the sum of the last `n` elements of the sorted array, and then computes the absolute difference between these sums. However, this approach does not correctly compute the sum of `f(p, q)` over all correct partitions of the array `a`.

The correct approach involves considering all possible partitions of the array `a` into two subsequences `p` and `q` of length `n` each, sorting `p` in non-decreasing order and `q` in non-increasing order, and then computing the cost `f(p, q) = ∑_{i = 1}^n |x_i - y_i|` for each partition. The sum of these costs over all partitions should be computed and returned modulo 998244353.

The current implementation does not consider all possible partitions and instead only computes a single value based on the sorted array. This leads to an incorrect result for many test cases. For example, consider the input:

```
2
1 2 3 4
```

The correct output should be the sum of the following costs:
1. `p = [1, 2], q = [3, 4]` → `f(p, q) = |1-4| + |2-3| = 4`
2. `p = [1, 3], q = [2, 4]` → `f(p, q) = |1-4| + |3-2| = 4`
3. `p = [1, 4], q = [2, 3]` → `f(p, q) = |1-3| + |4-2| = 4`
4. `p = [2, 3], q = [1, 4]` → `f(p, q) = |2-4| + |3-1| = 4`
5. `p = [2, 4], q = [1, 3]` → `f(p, q) = |2-3| + |4-1| = 4`
6. `p = [3, 4], q = [1, 2]` → `f(p, q) = |3-2| + |4-1| = 4`

The total sum is `4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24`, and the result modulo 998244353 is 24.

However, the current implementation would only compute the sum of the first `n` elements and the last `n` elements of the sorted array, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
