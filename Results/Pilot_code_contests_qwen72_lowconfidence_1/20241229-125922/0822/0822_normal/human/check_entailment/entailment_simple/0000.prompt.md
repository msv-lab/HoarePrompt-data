You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given an array a of length 2n. Consider a partition of array a into two subsequences p and q of length n each (each element of array a should be in exactly one subsequence: either in p or in q).

Let's sort p in non-decreasing order, and q in non-increasing order, we can denote the sorted versions by x and y, respectively. Then the cost of a partition is defined as f(p, q) = ∑_{i = 1}^n |x_i - y_i|.

Find the sum of f(p, q) over all correct partitions of array a. Since the answer might be too big, print its remainder modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150 000).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of array a.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the problem, modulo 998244353.

Note

Two partitions of an array are considered different if the sets of indices of elements included in the subsequence p are different.

In the first example, there are two correct partitions of the array a:

  1. p = [1], q = [4], then x = [1], y = [4], f(p, q) = |1 - 4| = 3; 
  2. p = [4], q = [1], then x = [4], y = [1], f(p, q) = |4 - 1| = 3. 



In the second example, there are six valid partitions of the array a: 

  1. p = [2, 1], q = [2, 1] (elements with indices 1 and 2 in the original array are selected in the subsequence p); 
  2. p = [2, 2], q = [1, 1]; 
  3. p = [2, 1], q = [1, 2] (elements with indices 1 and 4 are selected in the subsequence p); 
  4. p = [1, 2], q = [2, 1]; 
  5. p = [1, 1], q = [2, 2]; 
  6. p = [2, 1], q = [2, 1] (elements with indices 3 and 4 are selected in the subsequence p). 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 150 000, and a is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = input()
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    mod = 998244353
    a.sort()
    firsum = 0
    secsum = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i < n:
            firsum += a[i]
        else:
            secsum += a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`.
    k = abs(secsum - firsum) % mod
    fac = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, 2 * n + 1):
        fac.append(fac[-1] * i % mod)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`, `fac` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is the factorial of its index modulo `mod`, `i` is `2 * n + 1`.
    rr = fac[n] ** 2 % mod
    g = pow(rr, mod - 2, mod)
    print(k * (fac[2 * n] * g % mod) % mod)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
