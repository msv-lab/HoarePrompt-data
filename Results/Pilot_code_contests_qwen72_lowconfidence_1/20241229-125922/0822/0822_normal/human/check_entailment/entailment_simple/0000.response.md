### Analysis of the Program

The program aims to solve the problem described in the problem statement. Let's break down the program step by step to ensure it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading:**
   ```python
   n = input()
   a = map(int, raw_input().split())
   ```
   - The program reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `a`.
   - This part is correct as it matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   ```python
   a.sort()
   ```
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This is necessary for the subsequent steps where we split the array into two parts.

3. **Summing the First and Second Halves:**
   ```python
   firsum = 0
   secsum = 0
   for i in range(len(a)):
       if i < n:
           firsum += a[i]
       else:
           secsum += a[i]
   ```
   - The program calculates the sum of the first `n` elements (`firsum`) and the sum of the last `n` elements (`secsum`).
   - This is correct because it ensures that the first half of the sorted array is considered as one subsequence and the second half as the other subsequence.

4. **Calculating the Initial Cost:**
   ```python
   k = abs(secsum - firsum) % mod
   ```
   - The initial cost `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `secsum` and `firsum`, modulo `998244353`.
   - This is correct because it aligns with the problem's definition of the cost function.

5. **Calculating Factorials:**
   ```python
   fac = [1, 1]
   for i in range(2, 2 * n + 1):
       fac.append(fac[-1] * i % mod)
   ```
   - The program precomputes factorials up to `2n` modulo `998244353`.
   - This is necessary for calculating the number of valid partitions.

6. **Calculating the Result:**
   ```python
   rr = fac[n] ** 2 % mod
   g = pow(rr, mod - 2, mod)
   print(k * (fac[2 * n] * g % mod) % mod)
   ```
   - The program calculates the number of valid partitions using combinatorial mathematics and modular arithmetic.
   - The final result is printed as the product of `k` and the number of valid partitions, modulo `998244353`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem described in the problem statement. It reads the input, sorts the array, calculates the sums of the first and second halves, computes the initial cost, precomputes factorials, and finally calculates the result using combinatorial methods and modular arithmetic. Each step is consistent with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
