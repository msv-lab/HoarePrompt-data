The function reads a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000) and a list `a` of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) from standard input. It then sorts the list `a`, calculates the sum of the first `n` elements (`firsum`) and the sum of the last `n` elements (`secsum`). The function computes the absolute difference between `secsum` and `firsum`, takes the result modulo 998244353, and stores it in `k`. It also computes the factorial of each number from 0 to 2n (modulo 998244353) and stores these values in a list `fac`. The function then calculates the square of the factorial of `n` (modulo 998244353), finds its modular inverse, and uses these values to compute a final result which is printed to standard output. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include handling very large inputs efficiently to avoid performance issues.
