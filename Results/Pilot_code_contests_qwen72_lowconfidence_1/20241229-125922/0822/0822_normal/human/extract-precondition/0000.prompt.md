You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given an array a of length 2n. Consider a partition of array a into two subsequences p and q of length n each (each element of array a should be in exactly one subsequence: either in p or in q).

Let's sort p in non-decreasing order, and q in non-increasing order, we can denote the sorted versions by x and y, respectively. Then the cost of a partition is defined as f(p, q) = ∑_{i = 1}^n |x_i - y_i|.

Find the sum of f(p, q) over all correct partitions of array a. Since the answer might be too big, print its remainder modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150 000).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of array a.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the problem, modulo 998244353.

Note

Two partitions of an array are considered different if the sets of indices of elements included in the subsequence p are different.

In the first example, there are two correct partitions of the array a:

  1. p = [1], q = [4], then x = [1], y = [4], f(p, q) = |1 - 4| = 3; 
  2. p = [4], q = [1], then x = [4], y = [1], f(p, q) = |4 - 1| = 3. 



In the second example, there are six valid partitions of the array a: 

  1. p = [2, 1], q = [2, 1] (elements with indices 1 and 2 in the original array are selected in the subsequence p); 
  2. p = [2, 2], q = [1, 1]; 
  3. p = [2, 1], q = [1, 2] (elements with indices 1 and 4 are selected in the subsequence p); 
  4. p = [1, 2], q = [2, 1]; 
  5. p = [1, 1], q = [2, 2]; 
  6. p = [2, 1], q = [2, 1] (elements with indices 3 and 4 are selected in the subsequence p). 
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
