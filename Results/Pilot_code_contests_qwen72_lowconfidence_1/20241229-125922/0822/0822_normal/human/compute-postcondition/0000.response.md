The value of `n` is reassigned from the user input, converting the input to an integer. The previous condition that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 150 000 is still valid, assuming the user provides a valid input within this range. The list `a` remains unchanged and continues to hold 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150 000), `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
