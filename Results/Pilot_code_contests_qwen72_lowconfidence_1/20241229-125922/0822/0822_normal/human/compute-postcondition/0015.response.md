Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2, `mod` is 998244353, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i < n`, `firsum` is set to `a[0] + a[i]` and `secsum` is 0. If `i >= n`, `firsum` is 0 and `secsum` is set to `secsum + a[i]`.***
