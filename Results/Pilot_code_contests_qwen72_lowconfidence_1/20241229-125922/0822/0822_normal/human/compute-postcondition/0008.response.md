The code snippet updates the value of `firsum` by adding the element at index `i` of the list `a` to it. Since `i` is 0 initially, `firsum` will now hold the value of `a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged, except for `firsum`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is `a[0]`, `secsum` is 0, `i` is 0, and `i` is less than `n`.**
