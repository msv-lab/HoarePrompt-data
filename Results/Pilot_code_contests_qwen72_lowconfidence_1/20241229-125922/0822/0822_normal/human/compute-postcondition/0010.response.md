The value of `secsum` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` is not less than `n`, the specific index in the list `a` that is accessed is `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is 0, `secsum` is `a[i]`, `i` is not less than `n`.**
