Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`, `fac` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is the factorial of its index modulo `mod`, `i` is `2 * n + 1`.**
