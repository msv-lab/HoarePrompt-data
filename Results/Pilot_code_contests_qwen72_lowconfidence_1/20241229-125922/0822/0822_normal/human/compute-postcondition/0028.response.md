The code appends the result of `fac[-1] * i % mod` to the list `fac`. Given the initial conditions:

- `fac` is `[1, 1, 2, 6]`
- `i` is 4
- `mod` is 998244353

We calculate the new value to be appended:
- `fac[-1]` is 6 (the last element of `fac`)
- `i` is 4
- `fac[-1] * i % mod` is `6 * 4 % 998244353`, which is 24.

Thus, the new value `24` is appended to `fac`.

The updated state is:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000)
- `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `mod` is 998244353
- `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`
- `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`
- `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`
- `fac` is `[1, 1, 2, 6, 24]`
- `i` is 4
- `n` must be greater than 1

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`, `fac` is `[1, 1, 2, 6, 24]`, `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 1**
