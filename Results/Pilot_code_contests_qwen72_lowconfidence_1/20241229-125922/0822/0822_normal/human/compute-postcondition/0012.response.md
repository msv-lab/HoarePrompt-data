To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000).
- `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2.
- `mod` is 998244353.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - If `i` < `n`, `firsum` is set to `a[0]` and `secsum` remains 0.
  - If `i` is not less than `n`, `firsum` remains 0 and `secsum` is set to `a[i]`.
  - `i` is unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(a)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State**:
   - `i` is the current index in the loop.
   - `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers.
   - `len(a)` must be at least 2.
   - `mod` is 998244353.
   - `firsum` and `secsum` are set based on the condition `i < n`.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
   - Since `a` is a list of 2n integers, `len(a) = 2n`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `firsum` and `secsum` will be updated based on the new value of `i`:
     - If `i < n`, `firsum` will be set to `a[0]` and `secsum` will remain 0.
     - If `i >= n`, `firsum` will remain 0 and `secsum` will be set to `a[i]`.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the state will be:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `firsum` and `secsum` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2, `mod` is 998244353. If `i + 1` < `n`, `firsum` is set to `a[0]` and `secsum` remains 0. If `i + 1` is not less than `n`, `firsum` remains 0 and `secsum` is set to `a[i + 1]`. `i` is `i + 1`.**
