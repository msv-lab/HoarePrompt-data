The code appends the value of `fac[-1] * i % mod` to the list `fac`. Given that `fac` initially is `[1, 1, 2]`, the last element of `fac` (`fac[-1]`) is 2, and `i` is 3, the new element to be appended is `2 * 3 % 998244353`, which equals 6.

Therefore, the updated list `fac` becomes `[1, 1, 2, 6]`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`, `fac` is `[1, 1, 2, 6]`, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 1**
