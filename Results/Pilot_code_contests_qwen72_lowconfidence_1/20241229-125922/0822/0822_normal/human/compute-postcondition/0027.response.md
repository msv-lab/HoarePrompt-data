To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition:

1. The loop condition is `for i in range(2, 2 * n + 1)`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
4. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * n + 1`.

Given the current state:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000).
- `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `mod` is 998244353.
- `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`.
- `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`.
- `fac` is `[1, 1, 2, 6]`.
- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented from 3 to 4.
- The condition `i < 2 * n + 1` must still hold true.

Since `n` must be greater than 1, the minimum value of `n` is 2. Therefore, `2 * n + 1` is at least 5. Since `i` is 4, the condition `i < 2 * n + 1` is satisfied.

State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`, `fac` is `[1, 1, 2, 6]`, `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 1**
