The given code snippet is:
```python
print(k * (fac[2 * n] * g % mod) % mod)
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Expression Analysis**:
   - `k` is already defined as `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`.
   - `fac[2 * n]` is the factorial of `2 * n` modulo `mod`.
   - `g` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `fac[n]` under the modulus `mod`, calculated as `pow(fac[n], mod - 2, mod)`.
   - The expression `k * (fac[2 * n] * g % mod) % mod` computes the final result.

2. **Impact on Variables**:
   - No new variables are introduced.
   - No existing variables are modified in terms of their values.
   - The only action is printing the result of the expression.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The expression `k * (fac[2 * n] * g % mod) % mod` is evaluated and printed.
   - The result of this expression is a single value that is printed.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that a value has been printed. The variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`, `fac` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is the factorial of its index modulo `mod`, `i` is `2 * n + 1`, `rr` is `fac[n]`, `g` is `pow(fac[n], mod - 2, mod)`, and the value of `k * (fac[2 * n] * g % mod) % mod` has been printed.**
