To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

- The loop iterates over `i` from 2 to `2 * n + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the loop condition (`i < 2 * n + 1`) must still hold true.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - The loop condition `i < 2 * n + 1` must still be true for the loop to continue.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - For `i = 3` to satisfy `i < 2 * n + 1`, we need `3 < 2 * n + 1`.
   - Simplifying this, we get `2 < 2 * n`, which further simplifies to `1 < n`.

Since `n` must be greater than 0, the condition `1 < n` is satisfied if `n` is at least 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is now 3.
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`, `fac` is `[1, 1, 2]`, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 1**
