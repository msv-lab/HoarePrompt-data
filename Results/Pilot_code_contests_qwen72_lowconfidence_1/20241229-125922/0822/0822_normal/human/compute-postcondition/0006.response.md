To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000)
- `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `mod` is 998244353
- `firsum` is 0
- `secsum` is 0

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(a)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Length of `a`**: The loop will iterate over the length of the list `a`. Since `a` is defined as a sorted list of 2n integers, `len(a)` must be equal to 2n.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `len(a)` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is at least 1, `len(a)` will always be at least 2, ensuring the loop will execute at least once.
3. **Initial State of Loop Variables**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, and `a` should be a valid list with at least 2 elements.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000)
- `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `len(a)` must be at least 2
- `mod` is 998244353
- `firsum` is 0
- `secsum` is 0
- `i` is 0

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is 0, `secsum` is 0, `i` is 0**
