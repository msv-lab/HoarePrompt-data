The given code snippet updates the value of `firsum` by adding `a[i]` to its current value. Let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is incremented by 1 (from the initial state).
- `len(a)` must be at least 2 (remains unchanged).
- If the new `i` is less than `n`, `firsum` is initially set to `a[0] + a[i]` and `secsum` is 0.
- If the new `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `firsum` is 0 and `secsum` is updated to `secsum + a[i]`.

Given the code:
```
firsum += a[i]
```

This line adds the value of `a[i]` to `firsum`. Depending on the conditions specified in the initial state, the following scenarios are possible:

1. If the new `i` is less than `n`, `firsum` was previously set to `a[0] + a[i]`. After this code, `firsum` becomes `a[0] + a[i] + a[i]` or `a[0] + 2 * a[i]`.
2. If the new `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `firsum` was previously set to 0. After this code, `firsum` becomes `a[i]`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `secsum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `len(a)` must be at least 2, if the new `i` is less than `n`, `firsum` is `a[0] + 2 * a[i]` and `secsum` is 0, if the new `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `firsum` is `a[i]` and `secsum` is updated to `secsum + a[i]`.**
