To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000).
   - `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2.
   - `mod` is 998244353.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - If `i < n`, `firsum` is set to `a[0] + a[i]` and `secsum` is 0.
   - If `i >= n`, `firsum` is 0 and `secsum` is set to `secsum + a[i]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(a)):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `len(a) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue executing is `i < len(a)`.
   - We need to update the values of `firsum` and `secsum` based on the new value of `i`.

5. **New Values for `firsum` and `secsum`:**
   - If the new `i` is still less than `n`, then `firsum` should be set to `a[0] + a[i]` and `secsum` remains 0.
   - If the new `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `firsum` remains 0 and `secsum` should be updated to `secsum + a[i]`.

6. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `len(a)` must be at least 2.
   - If the new `i` is less than `n`, `firsum` is set to `a[0] + a[i]` and `secsum` is 0.
   - If the new `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `firsum` is 0 and `secsum` is updated to `secsum + a[i]`.

State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2, `mod` is 998244353, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i < n`, `firsum` is set to `a[0] + a[i]` and `secsum` is 0. If `i >= n`, `firsum` is 0 and `secsum` is set to `secsum + a[i]`.**
