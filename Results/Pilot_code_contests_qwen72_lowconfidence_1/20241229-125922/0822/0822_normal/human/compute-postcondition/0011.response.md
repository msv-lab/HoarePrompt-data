Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2, `mod` is 998244353. If `i` < `n`, `firsum` is set to `a[0]` and `secsum` remains 0. If `i` is not less than `n`, `firsum` remains 0 and `secsum` is set to `a[i]`. In both cases, `i` is unchanged.***
