To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000).
- `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `mod` is 998244353.
- `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`.
- `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`.
- `fac` is `[1, 1]`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(2, 2 * n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over the range from 2 to 2 * n + 1. This means the loop will execute if `2 * n + 1` is greater than 2, which simplifies to `n > 0`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop variable `i` starts at 2.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `a`, `mod`, `firsum`, `secsum`, `k`, `fac`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, but they are part of the initial state.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` is 2. The other variables remain as they are initialized.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`, `fac` is `[1, 1]`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0**.
