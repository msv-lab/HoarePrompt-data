The code snippet `rr = fac[n] ** 2 % mod` calculates the square of the `n`-th element in the `fac` list, modulo `mod`, and assigns this value to the variable `rr`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000)
- `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `mod` is 998244353
- `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`
- `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`
- `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`
- `fac` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is the factorial of its index modulo `mod`
- `i` is `2 * n + 1`

The value of `rr` is calculated as follows:
- `fac[n]` is the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`
- `fac[n] ** 2` is the square of `fac[n]`
- `fac[n] ** 2 % mod` is the result of squaring `fac[n]` and taking the result modulo `mod`

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000)
- `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `mod` is 998244353
- `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`
- `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`
- `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`
- `fac` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is the factorial of its index modulo `mod`
- `i` is `2 * n + 1`
- `rr` is `(fac[n] ** 2) % mod`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`, `fac` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is the factorial of its index modulo `mod`, `i` is `2 * n + 1`, `rr` is `(fac[n] ** 2) % mod`**
