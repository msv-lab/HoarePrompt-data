The code snippet `firsum += a[i]` updates the value of `firsum` by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. Given the conditions in the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000).
- `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2.
- `mod` is 998244353.
- If `i + 1` < `n`, `firsum` is set to `a[0]` and `secsum` remains 0.
- If `i + 1` is not less than `n`, `firsum` remains 0 and `secsum` is set to `a[i + 1]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check the Condition for `i + 1`**:
   - If `i + 1` < `n`, then `firsum` is initially set to `a[0]`.
   - If `i + 1` is not less than `n`, `firsum` remains 0 and `secsum` is set to `a[i + 1]`.

2. **Update `firsum`**:
   - The code `firsum += a[i]` adds the value of `a[i]` to `firsum`.
   - If `i + 1` < `n`, `firsum` was initially `a[0]`, so now `firsum` becomes `a[0] + a[i]`.
   - If `i + 1` is not less than `n`, `firsum` was initially 0, so now `firsum` becomes `a[i]`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000).
   - `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2.
   - `mod` is 998244353.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - If `i + 1` < `n`, `firsum` is `a[0] + a[i]` and `secsum` remains 0.
   - If `i + 1` is not less than `n`, `firsum` is `a[i]` and `secsum` is `a[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2, `mod` is 998244353, `i` is `i + 1`, if `i + 1` < `n` then `firsum` is `a[0] + a[i]` and `secsum` is 0, if `i + 1` is not less than `n` then `firsum` is `a[i]` and `secsum` is `a[i + 1]`.**
