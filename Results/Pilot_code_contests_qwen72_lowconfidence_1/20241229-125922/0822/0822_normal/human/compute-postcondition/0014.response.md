The code snippet `secsum += a[i]` updates the value of `secsum` by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. Based on the initial state:

- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000).
- `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2.
- `mod` is 998244353.
- If `i + 1` < `n`, `firsum` is set to `a[0]` and `secsum` remains 0.
- If `i + 1` is not less than `n`, `firsum` remains 0 and `secsum` is set to `a[i + 1]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

Given these conditions, the code `secsum += a[i]` adds the value of `a[i]` to `secsum`. Since `i` has already been incremented by 1, this means that `secsum` is updated with the value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `len(a)` must be at least 2, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is 0, `secsum` is `secsum + a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
