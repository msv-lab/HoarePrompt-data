The code snippet appends a new element to the list `fac`. This new element is calculated as `fac[-1] * i % mod`. Given the initial state:

- `fac` is `[1, 1]`
- `i` is `2`
- `mod` is `998244353`

The new element to be appended is `1 * 2 % 998244353`, which simplifies to `2`.

Therefore, the updated `fac` list is `[1, 1, 2]`. The value of `i` remains `2`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`, `fac` is `[1, 1, 2]`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0**
