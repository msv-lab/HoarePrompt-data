The code calculates the absolute difference between `secsum` and `firsum`, and then takes the modulus of this difference with `mod`. The result is assigned to the variable `k`.

- `k` is assigned the value `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `mod`, `firsum`, and `secsum` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`.**
