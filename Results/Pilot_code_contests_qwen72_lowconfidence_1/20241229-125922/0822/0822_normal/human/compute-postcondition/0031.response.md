The code snippet `g = pow(rr, mod - 2, mod)` calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `rr` under the modulus `mod`. This is done using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for a prime modulus `p`, the modular inverse of `a` is `a^(p-2) mod p`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000)
- `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `mod` is 998244353
- `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`
- `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`
- `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`
- `fac` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is the factorial of its index modulo `mod`
- `i` is `2 * n + 1`
- `rr` is `fac[n]`

After executing the code:
- `g` is calculated as `pow(rr, mod - 2, mod)`, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of `rr` under the modulus `mod`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353, `firsum` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a`, `secsum` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `a`, `k` is `abs(secsum - firsum) % mod`, `fac` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is the factorial of its index modulo `mod`, `i` is `2 * n + 1`, `rr` is `fac[n]`, `g` is `pow(fac[n], mod - 2, mod)`**
