The code snippet `a = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and then maps each string to an integer. This new list of integers is then assigned to the variable `a`.

- `n` remains an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000.
- `a` is now a list of 2n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, derived from the input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, read from user input.**
