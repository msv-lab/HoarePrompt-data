The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `n` and `mod` remain unchanged. The list `a` now contains the same elements as before, but they are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `a` is a sorted list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mod` is 998244353.**
