#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where each line contains a message (a string of up to 200 characters) composed of digits. The total number of messages does not exceed 50. Each message should be processed to convert it into a character string based on a predefined conversion table, or output "NA" if the message contains characters that cannot be converted.
def func():
    cs = {(1): [None] + list('abcde'), (2): [None] + list('fghij'), (3): [None] +
    list('klmno'), (4): [None] + list('pqrst'), (5): [None] + list('uvwxy'),
    (6): [None] + list('z.?! ')}
    while True:
        try:
            it = iter(raw_input().strip())
        except ValueError:
            break
        
        try:
            r = c = None
            s = []
            while True:
                r = int(it.next())
                c = int(it.next())
                s += [cs[r][c]]
                r = c = None
        except IndexError:
            stdout.write('NA\n')
        except StopIteration:
            if not r and not c:
                stdout.write(''.join(s) + '\n')
            else:
                stdout.write('NA\n')
            continue
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: The function has read all lines from stdin, `cs` remains a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion. For each valid line, the function has written the corresponding character string to stdout followed by a newline. For any line that contains invalid characters or is partially read, the function has written 'NA\n' to stdout. After processing all lines, the loop terminates, and `it` is no longer an active iterator.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads messages from standard input (stdin), where each message is a string of digits. It processes each message to convert it into a character string based on a predefined conversion table (`cs`). The function writes the resulting character string to standard output (stdout), followed by a newline. If a message contains characters that cannot be converted according to the table, or if the message is incomplete (i.e., ends prematurely without providing a valid pair of digits), the function writes "NA" followed by a newline to stdout. The function continues reading and processing messages until an invalid input (e.g., non-digit characters or EOF) is encountered, at which point it terminates. After processing all valid messages, the function ensures that all output is correctly written to stdout, and the program state is such that all input has been consumed and all output has been produced.
