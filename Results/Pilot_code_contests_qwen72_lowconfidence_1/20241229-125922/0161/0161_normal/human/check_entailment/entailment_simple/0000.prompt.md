You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One day, Taro received a strange email with only the number "519345213244" in the text. The email was from my cousin, who was 10 years older than me, so when I called and asked, "Oh, I sent it with a pocket bell because I was in a hurry. It's convenient. Nice to meet you!" I got it. You know this cousin, who is always busy and a little bit aggressive, and when you have no choice but to research "pager hitting" yourself, you can see that it is a method of input that prevailed in the world about 10 years ago. I understand.

In "Pokebell Strike", enter one character with two numbers, such as 11 for "A" and 15 for "O" according to the conversion table shown in Fig. 1. For example, to enter the string "Naruto", type "519345". Therefore, any letter can be entered with two numbers.

Figure 1

When mobile phones weren't widespread, high school students used this method to send messages from payphones to their friends' pagers. Some high school girls were able to pager at a tremendous speed. Recently, my cousin, who has been busy with work, has unknowingly started typing emails with a pager.

Therefore, in order to help Taro who is having a hard time deciphering every time, please write a program that converts the pager message into a character string and outputs it. However, the conversion table shown in Fig. 2 is used for conversion, and only lowercase letters, ".", "?", "!", And blanks are targeted. Output NA for messages that contain characters that cannot be converted.

Figure 2



Input

Multiple messages are given. One message (up to 200 characters) is given on each line. The total number of messages does not exceed 50.

Output

For each message, output the converted message or NA on one line.

Example

Input

341143514535
314
143565553551655311343411652235654535651124615163
551544654451431564
4
3411
6363636363
153414


Output

naruto
NA
do you wanna go to aizu?
yes sure!
NA
na

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdout

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where each line contains a message (a string of up to 200 characters) composed of digits. The total number of messages does not exceed 50. Each message should be processed to convert it into a character string based on a predefined conversion table, or output "NA" if the message contains characters that cannot be converted.
def func():
    cs = {(1): [None] + list('abcde'), (2): [None] + list('fghij'), (3): [None] +
    list('klmno'), (4): [None] + list('pqrst'), (5): [None] + list('uvwxy'),
    (6): [None] + list('z.?! ')}
    while True:
        try:
            it = iter(raw_input().strip())
        except ValueError:
            break
        
        try:
            r = c = None
            s = []
            while True:
                r = int(it.next())
                c = int(it.next())
                s += [cs[r][c]]
                r = c = None
        except IndexError:
            stdout.write('NA\n')
        except StopIteration:
            if not r and not c:
                stdout.write(''.join(s) + '\n')
            else:
                stdout.write('NA\n')
            continue
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: The function has read all lines from stdin, `cs` remains a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion. For each valid line, the function has written the corresponding character string to stdout followed by a newline. For any line that contains invalid characters or is partially read, the function has written 'NA\n' to stdout. After processing all lines, the loop terminates, and `it` is no longer an active iterator.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
