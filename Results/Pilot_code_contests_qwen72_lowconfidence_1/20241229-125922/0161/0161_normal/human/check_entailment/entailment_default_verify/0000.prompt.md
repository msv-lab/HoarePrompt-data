You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, Taro received a strange email with only the number "519345213244" in the text. The email was from my cousin, who was 10 years older than me, so when I called and asked, "Oh, I sent it with a pocket bell because I was in a hurry. It's convenient. Nice to meet you!" I got it. You know this cousin, who is always busy and a little bit aggressive, and when you have no choice but to research "pager hitting" yourself, you can see that it is a method of input that prevailed in the world about 10 years ago. I understand.

In "Pokebell Strike", enter one character with two numbers, such as 11 for "A" and 15 for "O" according to the conversion table shown in Fig. 1. For example, to enter the string "Naruto", type "519345". Therefore, any letter can be entered with two numbers.

Figure 1

When mobile phones weren't widespread, high school students used this method to send messages from payphones to their friends' pagers. Some high school girls were able to pager at a tremendous speed. Recently, my cousin, who has been busy with work, has unknowingly started typing emails with a pager.

Therefore, in order to help Taro who is having a hard time deciphering every time, please write a program that converts the pager message into a character string and outputs it. However, the conversion table shown in Fig. 2 is used for conversion, and only lowercase letters, ".", "?", "!", And blanks are targeted. Output NA for messages that contain characters that cannot be converted.

Input

Multiple messages are given. One message (up to 200 characters) is given on each line. The total number of messages does not exceed 50.

Output

For each message, output the converted message or NA on one line.

Example

Input

Program:
```
from sys import stdout

def func():
    cs = {1: [None] + list('abcde'), 2: [None] + list('fghij'), 3: [None] + list('klmno'), 4: [None] + list('pqrst'), 5: [None] + list('uvwxy'), 6: [None] + list('z.?! ')}
    while True:
        try:
            it = iter(raw_input().strip())
        except ValueError:
            break
        try:
            r = c = None
            s = []
            while True:
                r = int(it.next())
                c = int(it.next())
                s += [cs[r][c]]
                r = c = None
        except IndexError:
            stdout.write('NA\n')
        except StopIteration:
            if not r and (not c):
                stdout.write(''.join(s) + '\n')
            else:
                stdout.write('NA\n')
            continue


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Here is a specific case where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1111
```

**Expected Output:**
```
aa
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NA
```

The program incorrectly outputs `NA` for valid inputs where the length of the input is even and all characters can be converted according to the conversion table. This is because the program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2, and the `next()` method on the iterator `it` may raise a `StopIteration` exception, which is not properly handled in all cases. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the input is valid but the total length is not a multiple of 2, leading to incorrect outputs like `NA`.

To fix this, the program should ensure that it correctly handles the iteration over the input string and properly checks for the validity of the input length.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` reads messages from standard input (stdin), where each message is a string of digits. It processes each message to convert it into a character string based on a predefined conversion table (`cs`). The function writes the resulting character string to standard output (stdout), followed by a newline. If a message contains characters that cannot be converted according to the table, or if the message is incomplete (i.e., ends prematurely without providing a valid pair of digits), the function writes "NA" followed by a newline to stdout. The function continues reading and processing messages until an invalid input (e.g., non-digit characters or EOF) is encountered, at which point it terminates. After processing all valid messages, the function ensures that all output is correctly written to stdout, and the program state is such that all input has been consumed and all output has been produced.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
