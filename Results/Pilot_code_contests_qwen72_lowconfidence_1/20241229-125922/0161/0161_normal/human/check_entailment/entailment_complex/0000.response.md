Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Handling of Input and Output:**
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is a Python 2 function. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This means the program will not work as intended in Python 3 environments.
   - The program does not handle the case where the input is empty or invalid (e.g., non-numeric characters). While the problem description assumes valid input, the program should still gracefully handle unexpected inputs to avoid crashes.

2. **Conversion Table:**
   - The conversion table `cs` is defined correctly, but the program does not handle the case where the input contains invalid pairs of digits (e.g., "78" or "01"). According to the problem description, such cases should result in "NA" being printed. The current implementation does not explicitly check for this and may produce incorrect results or crash.

3. **Partial Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `try-except` blocks to handle `IndexError` and `StopIteration`, but it does not ensure that all valid input is processed correctly. For example, if the input is "1115" (which should be "ab"), the program might incorrectly interpret it as "a" and then fail due to an incomplete pair.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program writes output using `stdout.write()`, which is fine, but it should ensure that each output is followed by a newline character. The current implementation does this correctly, but it could be more robust.

### Case Where the Program Fails:

- **Invalid Input Pairs:**
  - If the input contains invalid pairs like "78" or "01", the program will raise an `IndexError` or produce incorrect results instead of printing "NA".

- **Incomplete Input:**
  - If the input is incomplete, such as "111" (missing the second digit of the last pair), the program will raise an `IndexError` instead of printing "NA".

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle all edge cases and invalid inputs as specified in the problem description. Therefore, it is not fully correct and should be marked as **False**.
