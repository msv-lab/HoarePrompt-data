Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Here is a specific case where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1111
```

**Expected Output:**
```
aa
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NA
```

The program incorrectly outputs `NA` for valid inputs where the length of the input is even and all characters can be converted according to the conversion table. This is because the program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2, and the `next()` method on the iterator `it` may raise a `StopIteration` exception, which is not properly handled in all cases. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the input is valid but the total length is not a multiple of 2, leading to incorrect outputs like `NA`.

To fix this, the program should ensure that it correctly handles the iteration over the input string and properly checks for the validity of the input length.
