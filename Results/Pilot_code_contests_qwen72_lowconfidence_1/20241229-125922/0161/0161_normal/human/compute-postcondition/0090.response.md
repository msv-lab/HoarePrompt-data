To analyze the `try`-`except` block, we need to consider the points at which exceptions can occur and how the program handles these exceptions. Let's break down the code and the possible states step by step.

### Code Analysis
```python
try:
    r = c = None
    s = []
    while True:
        r = int(it.next())
        c = int(it.next())
        s += [cs[r][c]]
        r = c = None
except IndexError:
    stdout.write('NA\n')
except StopIteration:
    if not r and not c:
        stdout.write(''.join(s) + '\n')
    else:
        stdout.write('NA\n')
    continue
```

### Points of Exception
1. **IndexError**: This could occur if `cs[r][c]` is accessed with indices that are out of bounds. For example, if `r` or `c` are not valid keys in the dictionary `cs`.
2. **StopIteration**: This is raised by the `next()` method when the iterator `it` is exhausted (i.e., there are no more elements to iterate over).

### Execution Summary
1. **Try Block Execution**:
   - `r` and `c` are initialized to `None`.
   - An empty list `s` is initialized.
   - A `while True` loop is entered, which will run indefinitely until an exception is raised or a `break` statement is encountered.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `r` and `c` are set to the next integers from the iterator `it`.
     - The character at position `cs[r][c]` is appended to the list `s`.
     - `r` and `c` are reset to `None`.

2. **Except Blocks**:
   - **IndexError**:
     - If an `IndexError` occurs (e.g., `cs[r][c]` is out of bounds), the program writes 'NA\n' to the standard output and the state becomes undefined.
   - **StopIteration**:
     - If a `StopIteration` is raised (i.e., the iterator `it` is exhausted):
       - If both `r` and `c` are `None`, the list `s` is joined into a string and written to the standard output followed by a newline character.
       - If either `r` or `c` is not `None`, 'NA\n' is written to the standard output.
     - The `continue` statement is used to move to the next iteration of the outer loop (if there is one).

### Final Output State
- **Valid Input**:
  - `r` and `c` are `None`.
  - `s` is a list containing the characters corresponding to the pairs of integers read from `stdin`.
  - The length of `s` is equal to the number of pairs of integers processed.
  - The function writes the concatenated string of `s` to the standard output followed by a newline character.
- **Invalid Access (IndexError)**:
  - The function writes 'NA\n' to the standard output.
  - The state of the program is undefined.
- **Exhausted Iterator (StopIteration)**:
  - If both `r` and `c` are `None`, the function writes the concatenated string of `s` to the standard output followed by a newline character.
  - If either `r` or `c` is not `None`, the function writes 'NA\n' to the standard output.
  - The loop continues to the next iteration.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion. If the input is valid, `r` and `c` are `None`, and `s` is a list containing the characters corresponding to the pairs of integers read from `stdin`. The function writes the concatenated string of `s` to the standard output followed by a newline character. If an `IndexError` occurs, the function writes 'NA\n' to the standard output, and the state of the program is undefined. If a `StopIteration` is raised, and both `r` and `c` are `None`, the function writes the concatenated string of `s` to the standard output followed by a newline character. If either `r` or `c` is not `None`, the function writes 'NA\n' to the standard output, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
