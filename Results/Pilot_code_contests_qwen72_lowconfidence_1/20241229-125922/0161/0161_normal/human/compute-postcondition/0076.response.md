The code snippet sets both `r` and `c` to `None`. This overrides their previous values, which were the next integers from `it`. The other variables (`func`, `cs`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is a list containing the elements `cs[r][c]` and `cs[r][c]`**
