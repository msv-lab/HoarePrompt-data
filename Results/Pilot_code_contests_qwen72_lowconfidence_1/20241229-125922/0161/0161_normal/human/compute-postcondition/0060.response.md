An `IndexError` can occur when attempting to access an element from a list using an index that is out of bounds. In this code, it could happen when trying to access `cs[r][c]` if `r` or `c` is not a valid index in the `cs` dictionary.

A `StopIteration` exception can occur when the iterator `it` is exhausted, meaning there are no more elements to iterate over. This happens when the `next()` method is called on an iterator that has no more items.

### Summary of the Try-Except Block:
- **Try Block**: The program initializes `r` and `c` to `None` and creates an empty list `s`. It then enters a loop where it reads two integers from the iterator `it`, converts them to integers, and uses them to index into the `cs` dictionary to get a character. This character is appended to the list `s`. After each successful operation, `r` and `c` are reset to `None`.
- **Except IndexError**: If an `IndexError` occurs (e.g., `r` or `c` is out of bounds for the `cs` dictionary), the program writes 'NA\n' to standard output.
- **Except StopIteration**: If a `StopIteration` occurs (e.g., the iterator `it` is exhausted), the program checks if `r` and `c` are both `None`. If they are, it writes the joined list `s` to standard output followed by a newline. If either `r` or `c` is not `None`, it writes 'NA\n' to standard output. The `continue` statement suggests that the loop should continue to the next iteration, but this is problematic because the loop is infinite and there is no break condition.

### Final Output State:
- **If the input is valid and the iterator is not exhausted**: `r` and `c` are `None`, `s` contains the characters corresponding to each pair of integers read from the input string, and the function writes the joined list `s` to standard output followed by a newline.
- **If an `IndexError` occurs**: The program writes 'NA\n' to standard output.
- **If a `StopIteration` occurs and `r` and `c` are both `None`:** The program writes the joined list `s` to standard output followed by a newline.
- **If a `StopIteration` occurs and either `r` or `c` is not `None`:** The program writes 'NA\n' to standard output.

### Output State:
**`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid. If the input is valid and the iterator is not exhausted, the function writes the joined list `s` to standard output followed by a newline. If an `IndexError` occurs, the function writes 'NA\n' to standard output. If a `StopIteration` occurs and `r` and `c` are both `None`, the function writes the joined list `s` to standard output followed by a newline. If a `StopIteration` occurs and either `r` or `c` is not `None`, the function writes 'NA\n' to standard output.**
