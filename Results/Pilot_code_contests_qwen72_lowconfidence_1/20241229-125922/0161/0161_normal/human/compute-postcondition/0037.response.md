For the given `while True:` loop, the condition is always true, meaning the loop is set to run indefinitely unless there is some internal mechanism (like a break statement within the loop) that stops it. Given that the condition is always true, no modifications to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is an empty list**
