The value of `c` is updated to the integer value of the next character from the iterator `it`. The previous value of `c` is no longer relevant, and the new value of `c` is the integer value of the next character in the iteration. The states of the other variables (`func`, `cs`, `it`, `r`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is the integer value of the next character from `it`, `c` is the integer value of the next character from `it`, `s` is `[cs[r][c]]`**
