The value of `r` is updated to the integer value of the next character in the iterator `it`. The previous value of `r` was `None`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is the integer value of the next character in `it`, `c` is `None`, `s` is a list containing the character `cs[r][c]` (where `r` is now the integer value of the next character in `it` and `c` is `None`)**
