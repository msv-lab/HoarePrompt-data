Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is a list of characters converted from the input string using `cs`, with each character in `s` being `cs[r][c]` where `r` and `c` are the corresponding integers from the input. The length of `s` is half the length of the input string, assuming the input string is valid and has an even number of characters. If the input string is invalid or has an odd number of characters, an error may occur.**
