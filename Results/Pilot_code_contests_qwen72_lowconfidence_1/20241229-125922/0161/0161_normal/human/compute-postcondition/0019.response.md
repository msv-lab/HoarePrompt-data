The value of `c` is updated by converting the next character from the iterator `it` to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is the integer value of the next character from `it`, `c` is the integer value of the next character from `it`, `s` is `[cs[1][0], cs[1][0]]`**
