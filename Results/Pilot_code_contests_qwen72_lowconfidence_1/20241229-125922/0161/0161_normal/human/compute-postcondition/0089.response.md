The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of the loop.

Given the initial state, the values of `r`, `c`, and `s` are not explicitly known, but their conditions determine what gets written to the standard output before the `continue` statement is encountered. Since the `continue` statement is executed, it implies that the program is inside a loop.

The initial state conditions indicate that:
- If both `r` and `c` are `False`, `s` is joined into a string and written to stdout followed by a newline character.
- Otherwise, if either `r` is `True` or `c` is `True`, 'NA\n' has been written to the standard output.

The `continue` statement itself does not alter these conditions or the values of the variables, but it indicates that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **If both `r` and `c` are `False`, `s` is joined into a string and written to stdout followed by a newline character. Otherwise, if either `r` is `True` or `c` is `True`, 'NA\n' has been written to the standard output. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
