The code snippet `c = int(it.next())` updates the value of `c` to the integer value of the next character in the iterator `it`. The previous state indicates that `c` was `None`, and `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string.

Given that `r` is the integer value of the next character in `it` before this line, after executing the code, `c` will hold the integer value of the next character in `it`.

Since the specific value of `it.next()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact integer value of `c`. However, we know that `c` is now an integer derived from the next character in `it`.

The states of the other variables (`func`, `cs`, `it`, `r`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is the integer value of the next character in `it`, `c` is an integer value of the next character in `it`, `s` is a list containing the character `cs[r][c]` (where `r` is now the integer value of the next character in `it` and `c` is the integer value of the next character in `it`)**
