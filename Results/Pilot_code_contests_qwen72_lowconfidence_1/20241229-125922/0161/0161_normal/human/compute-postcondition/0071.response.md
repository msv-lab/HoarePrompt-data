The code snippet sets both `r` and `c` to `None`. This means that the previous values of `r` and `c`, which were the next integer values from the iterator `it`, are no longer relevant and are now `None`.

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is a list containing the element `cs[r][c]` (where `r` and `c` are now `None`).**
