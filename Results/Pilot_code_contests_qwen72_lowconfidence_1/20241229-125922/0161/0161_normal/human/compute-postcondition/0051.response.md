The code `r = c = None` assigns the value `None` to both `r` and `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is a list containing the characters `[cs[r][c], cs[r][c], cs[r][c]]`**.
