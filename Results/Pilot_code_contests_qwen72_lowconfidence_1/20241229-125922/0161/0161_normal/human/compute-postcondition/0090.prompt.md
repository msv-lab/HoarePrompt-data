You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for summarizing the state of the function after executing a Python `try` statement. You will be provided with the final state of the program after executing the `try` block, and the changes in the program after executing one or more `except` blocks in any situation. Please combine this information to summarize the program's state after the complete execution of the `try` statement. If there is a return always include it in the output sate. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example 1:

Initial State: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.
Code for the try except block:
```
try:
    result = a / b
    return result
except ZeroDivisionError:
    return None
```
Ouput state after the execution of the try statement: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `result` is the result of `a` divided by `b`, and the function returns `result`.
Output state after the execution of the except statement(s): The function returns None if a ZeroDivisionError occurs.

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? Summarise what the try except statement accomplishes and what the program output state is after it is executed.


Example Answer 1:
A `ZeroDivisionError` might be triggered at `result = a / b`. If `b` is 0, the `ZeroDivisionError` is raised, and the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are integers. If `b` is zero, the function returns `None`, otherwise, the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `b` is zero, the function returns `None`, otherwise the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`.**

Example 2:

Program state after fully executing the `try` block:
Initial State: file_path is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file.

Code for the try except block:
```
def read_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            data = file.read()
            print("File content successfully read.")
            return data

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The file was not found. Please check the file path.")
        return None

    except PermissionError:
        print("Error: You do not have permission to read this file.")
        return None
```
Output state after the execution of the try statement: `file_path` is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file, data is the contents of that file and the function returns that content.
Output state after the execution of the except statement(s):
Except statement 1:The function return None and prints "Error: The file was not found. Please check the file path." 
Except statement 2: The function return None and prints "Error: You do not have permission to read this file."

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? Summarise what the try except statement accomplishes and what the program output state is after it is executed.


Example Answer 2 :
The program could raise a `FileNotFoundError` if the file is not found at the specified path or a `PermissionError` if the user does not have permission to read the file. If the file is found and the user has permission, the function reads the file content and returns it. 
Therefore: Output State: **file_path is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file. If the file is found and the user has permission, the function returns the file content, otherwise, it prints an error message and returns None.**


Your Task:

Initial State: In the given code snippet, a `ValueError` might occur during the execution of `it = iter(raw_input().strip())` if the input from `stdin` cannot be processed correctly, leading to an invalid operation when attempting to create an iterator from the stripped input.

The `try` block attempts to read input from `stdin`, strip any leading or trailing whitespace, and then create an iterator (`it`) over the characters of the input string. If the input is valid and no exceptions are raised, the program continues with `it` being an iterator over the characters of the input string, and `r` and `c` remain `None` if they were `None` initially.

If a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the input from `stdin` is invalid (e.g., the input is not a string that can be iterated over), the `except` block is executed. In this case, the `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the state of the program undefined beyond this point.

Summarizing the `try`-`except` statement:
- The `try` block ensures that `it` is set to an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid.
- The `except` block handles the case where the input is invalid by breaking out of the current loop or if statement, leaving the state of the program undefined.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion. If the input is valid, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string, and `r` and `c` remain `None` if they were `None` initially. If a `ValueError` occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of the program is undefined.**
Code for the try except block:
```
try:
    r = c = None
    s = []
    while True:
        r = int(it.next())
        c = int(it.next())
        s += [cs[r][c]]
        r = c = None
except IndexError:
    stdout.write('NA\n')
except StopIteration:
    if not r and not c:
        stdout.write(''.join(s) + '\n')
    else:
        stdout.write('NA\n')
    continue

```
Output state after the execution of the try statement: `func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is a list containing the characters corresponding to the pairs of integers read from `stdin` until the loop terminates. The length of `s` is equal to the number of pairs of integers processed.
Output state after the execution of the except statement(s): 
except_1: the state is unknown, 'NA\n' is written to the standard output
except_2: If both `r` and `c` are `False`, `s` is joined into a string and written to stdout followed by a newline character. Otherwise, if either `r` is `True` or `c` is `True`, 'NA\n' has been written to the standard output. The loop continues to the next iteration.

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? Summarise what the try except statement accomplishes and what the program output state is after it is executed.
