The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since the initial state does not specify that the program is within a loop, the effect of `continue` is undefined in this context. However, assuming the program is within a loop, the variables `r`, `c`, and `s` are not altered by the `continue` statement itself.

Given the initial state, the conditions about `r`, `c`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects no change in the variables but indicates that the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **State is UNKNOWN. If `r` is False and `c` is False, `s` is undefined (attempted to join and write to stdout). Otherwise, either `r` is True, `c` is True, or both are True, and 'NA\n' is written to stdout. Loop continues to the next iteration.**
