The code snippet `c = int(it.next())` reads the next character from the iterator `it`, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `c`.

- `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string.
- `r` is the integer value of the first character in the input string.
- `c` was initially `None`.

After executing the code, `c` is now the integer value of the next character in the input string.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is the integer value of the first character in the input string, `c` is the integer value of the second character in the input string, `s` is an empty list**.
