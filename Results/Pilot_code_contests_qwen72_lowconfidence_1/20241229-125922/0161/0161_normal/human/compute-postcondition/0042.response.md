For a `while True` loop, the condition for the loop to continue executing is always true, meaning the loop will run indefinitely unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Since the loop condition does not depend on any specific state variables (`func`, `cs`, `it`, `r`, `c`, `s`), no adjustments to these variables are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is a list containing the character `cs[r][c]` (where `r` and `c` are now `None`)**
