The code snippet assigns `None` to both `r` and `c`. This operation does not affect any other variables or the state of the program, except for the values of `r` and `c`.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is None, `c` is None. If a `ValueError` occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and no further processing of the current iteration or condition is performed.**
