The code snippet `stdout.write('NA\n')` writes the string `'NA\n'` to the standard output. This operation does not alter the values of the variables `r` or `c`. The state of the variables remains unchanged, but the output has been written.

Output State: **State.UNKNOWN, either `r` is true or `c` is true, or both are true, 'NA\n' is written to stdout**
