The code snippet sets both `r` and `c` to `None`. The other variables (`func`, `cs`, `it`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

- `func` is expected to read input from stdin.
- `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion.
- `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid.
- `s` is `[cs[r][c], cs[r][c]]`.

Since `r` and `c` are now set to `None`, the expression `cs[r][c]` would raise a `TypeError` if evaluated, because `None` cannot be used as an index.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is `[cs[r][c], cs[r][c]]` (which would raise a TypeError if evaluated)**.
