The code snippet initializes an empty list named `s`. This does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the creation of this new list.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is None, `c` is None, `s` is an empty list.**
