For the given `while True:` loop, since the condition is always true (i.e., the loop is infinite), no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are no exceptions that cause the program to exit the loop.

State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid. If the input is valid and the loop completes normally, the program writes the concatenated characters to `stdout`. If an `IndexError` occurs, the program writes 'NA\n' to `stdout`. If a `StopIteration` occurs, the program writes 'NA\n' if the last read was partial, otherwise, it writes the concatenated characters. A `SyntaxError` occurs due to the `continue` statement being outside a loop.**
