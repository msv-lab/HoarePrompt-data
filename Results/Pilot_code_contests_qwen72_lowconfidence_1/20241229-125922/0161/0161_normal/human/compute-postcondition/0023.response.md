The code snippet `stdout.write('NA\n')` writes the string `'NA\n'` to the standard output stream. This operation does not alter any variables in the program's state. Since the initial state is unknown, there are no specific variables to track changes for.

Output State: **the state is unknown, 'NA\n' has been written to stdout**
