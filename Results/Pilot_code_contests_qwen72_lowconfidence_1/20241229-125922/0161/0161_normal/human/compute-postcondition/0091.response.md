Output State: **The function has read all lines from stdin, `cs` remains a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion. For each valid line, the function has written the corresponding character string to stdout followed by a newline. For any line that contains invalid characters or is partially read, the function has written 'NA\n' to stdout. After processing all lines, the loop terminates, and `it` is no longer an active iterator.**
