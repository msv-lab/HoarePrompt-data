### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Try Block:**
   - The `try` block initializes `r` and `c` to `None` and creates an empty list `s`.
   - It enters an infinite loop where it attempts to read two consecutive integers from the iterator `it`.
   - These integers are used as indices to access a character from the dictionary `cs`.
   - The character is appended to the list `s`.
   - After appending, `r` and `c` are reset to `None`.

2. **Potential Exceptions:**
   - **IndexError:** This could occur if the index `r` or `c` is out of bounds for the list in `cs`.
   - **StopIteration:** This occurs when the iterator `it` is exhausted, meaning there are no more elements to read from the input.

3. **Handling Exceptions:**
   - **IndexError:** If an `IndexError` occurs, the program writes 'NA\n' to `stdout` and exits the `try` block.
   - **StopIteration:** If a `StopIteration` occurs:
     - If both `r` and `c` are `None` (indicating the loop ended normally without any partial read), the program writes the joined list `s` to `stdout`.
     - If either `r` or `c` is not `None` (indicating a partial read), the program writes 'NA\n' to `stdout`.
     - The `continue` statement is intended to continue the outer loop, but since it is outside any loop in the given context, it causes a `SyntaxError`.

4. **Summary of the Try-Except Statement:**
   - The `try` block reads pairs of integers from the input and converts them to characters using the `cs` dictionary.
   - If the input is valid and the loop completes normally, the program writes the concatenated characters to `stdout`.
   - If an `IndexError` occurs, indicating an invalid index, the program writes 'NA\n' to `stdout`.
   - If a `StopIteration` occurs, the program checks if the last read was partial. If it was, it writes 'NA\n'; otherwise, it writes the concatenated characters.
   - The `continue` statement outside the loop causes a `SyntaxError`.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid. If the input is valid and the loop completes normally, the program writes the concatenated characters to `stdout`. If an `IndexError` occurs, the program writes 'NA\n' to `stdout`. If a `StopIteration` occurs, the program writes 'NA\n' if the last read was partial, otherwise, it writes the concatenated characters. A `SyntaxError` occurs due to the `continue` statement being outside a loop.**
