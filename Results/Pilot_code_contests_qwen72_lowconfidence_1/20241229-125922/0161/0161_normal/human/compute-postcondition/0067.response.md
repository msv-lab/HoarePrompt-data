For the given `while True:` loop, the condition of the loop is always true, meaning the loop will execute indefinitely unless there's a break statement within the loop body or an exception is raised. Since the loop condition does not depend on any of the variables mentioned (`func`, `cs`, `r`, `c`, `s`), no modifications to these variables are necessary for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is an empty list**
