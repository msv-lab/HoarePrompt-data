The line of code `it = iter(raw_input().strip())` creates an iterator `it` over the characters of the input string, after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. This operation does not change the values of `func`, `cs`, `r`, or `c`. However, it updates the state of `it`.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string (after stripping leading and trailing whitespace), `r` and `c` are both `None` if they were `None` initially.**
