The code snippet `r = c = None` sets both `r` and `c` to `None`. This affects the variables `r` and `c`, changing their values from whatever they were previously to `None`. The other variables (`func`, `cs`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is a list containing the elements `cs[r][c]`, `cs[r][c]`**.
