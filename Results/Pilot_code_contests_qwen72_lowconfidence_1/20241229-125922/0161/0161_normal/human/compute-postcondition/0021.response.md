The variables `r` and `c` are both set to `None`. The other variables (`func`, `cs`, `it`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is `[cs[1][0], cs[1][0], cs[r][c]]`**
