The code snippet `stdout.write('NA\n')` writes the string 'NA\n' to the standard output. This operation does not affect the variables `r` or `c`. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the output operation.

Output State: **State.UNKNOWN, either `r` is true or `c` is true, 'NA\n' is written to the standard output**
