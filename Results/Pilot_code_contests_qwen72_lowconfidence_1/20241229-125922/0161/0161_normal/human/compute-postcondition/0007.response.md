For the given `while True:` loop, the condition always evaluates to `True`, meaning the loop is designed to run indefinitely unless there is a break or return statement inside the loop body. Since the loop condition does not depend on any of the variables (`func`, `cs`, `it`, `r`, `c`, `s`) in the provided state, no modifications to the state are necessary for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is None, `c` is None, `s` is an empty list**
