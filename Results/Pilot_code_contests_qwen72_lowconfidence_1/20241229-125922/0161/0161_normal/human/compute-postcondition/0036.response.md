The code snippet initializes an empty list `s`. This action does not affect the other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is an empty list**.
