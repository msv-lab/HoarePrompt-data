The value of `r` is updated to the next integer value obtained from the iterator `it`. The previous value of `r` is overwritten, and the new value of `r` is the integer representation of the next character in the input string. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is the integer value of the next character from `it`, `c` is an integer between 1 and 6, `s` is `[cs[r][c]]`**
