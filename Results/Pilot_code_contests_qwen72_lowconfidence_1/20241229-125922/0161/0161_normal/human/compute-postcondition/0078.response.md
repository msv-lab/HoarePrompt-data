The value of `r` is updated to the integer value returned by the next item from the iterator `it`. The other variables (`func`, `cs`, `c`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `r` is the integer value returned by `it.next()`, `c` is `None`, `s` is a list containing the elements `cs[r][c]` and `cs[r][c]`**
