The code `it = iter(raw_input().strip())` reads a line of input from stdin, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and creates an iterator over the characters in the stripped string.

- `it` is now an iterator over the characters of the input string.
- The initial state specifies that `func` is expected to read input from stdin, and `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion. These remain unchanged.

Output State: **`it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string, `func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion.**
