The code sets both `r` and `c` to `None`. This affects the variables `r` and `c`, which previously held the integer values of the next characters in the iterator `it`.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is a list containing the characters `[cs[r][c], cs[r][c]]`.**
