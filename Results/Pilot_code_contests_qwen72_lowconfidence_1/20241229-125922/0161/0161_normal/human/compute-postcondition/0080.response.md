The code `s += [cs[r][c]]` appends the element found at `cs[r][c]` to the list `s`. 

- `func` remains unchanged.
- `cs` remains unchanged.
- `r` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `s` is updated to include the new element `cs[r][c]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `r` is the integer value returned by `it.next()`, `c` is an integer value obtained from `it.next()`, `s` is a list containing the elements `cs[r][c]`, `cs[r][c]`**.
