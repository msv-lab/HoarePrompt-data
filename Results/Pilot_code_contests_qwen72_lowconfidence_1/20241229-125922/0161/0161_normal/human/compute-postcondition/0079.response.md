The code assigns the next value from the iterator `it` to the variable `c`, converting this value to an integer. The initial state indicates that `c` was `None`, and now it will hold an integer value obtained from `it.next()`.

- `c` is now an integer value obtained from `it.next()`.
- The values of `func`, `cs`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `r` is the integer value returned by `it.next()`, `c` is an integer value obtained from `it.next()`, `s` is a list containing the elements `cs[r][c]` and `cs[r][c]`**.
