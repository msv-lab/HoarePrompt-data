The code snippet sets both `r` and `c` to `None`. This overrides their previous values, which were the integer values of the first and second characters in the input string, respectively. The other variables (`func`, `cs`, `it`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from stdin, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is `[cs[r][c]]` (which will raise an error since `r` and `c` are now `None`).**
