The code snippet `c = int(it.next())` reads the next character from the iterator `it` and converts it to an integer, assigning this integer to the variable `c`.

- `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string.
- `r` is the integer value of the first character of the input string.
- Since `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string, and assuming the input string has more than one character, `it.next()` will return the second character of the input string.
- This second character is then converted to an integer and assigned to `c`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is the integer value of the first character of the input string, `c` is the integer value of the second character of the input string, `s` is an empty list.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is the integer value of the first character of the input string, `c` is the integer value of the second character of the input string, `s` is an empty list**
