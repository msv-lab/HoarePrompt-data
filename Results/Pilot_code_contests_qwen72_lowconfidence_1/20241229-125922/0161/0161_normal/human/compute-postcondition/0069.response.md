The value of `c` is updated to the integer value obtained from calling `it.next()`. Since `it` is an iterator, `it.next()` retrieves the next integer value from the iterator. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `r` is the next integer value from the iterator `it`, `c` is the next integer value from the iterator `it`, `s` is an empty list**
