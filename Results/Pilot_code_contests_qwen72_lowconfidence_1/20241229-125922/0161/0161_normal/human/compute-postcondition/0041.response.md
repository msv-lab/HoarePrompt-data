The variables `r` and `c` are both set to `None`. The other variables (`func`, `cs`, `it`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`, `s` is a list containing the character `cs[r][c]` (where `r` and `c` are now `None`).**
