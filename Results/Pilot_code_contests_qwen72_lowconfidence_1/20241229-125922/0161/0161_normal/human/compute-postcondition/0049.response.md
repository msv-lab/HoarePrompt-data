The code `c = int(it.next())` reads the next character from the iterator `it`, converts it to an integer, and assigns this integer to the variable `c`.

Given the initial state:
- `func` is expected to read input from `stdin`.
- `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion.
- `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid.
- `r` is the integer value of the next character from the iterator `it`.
- `c` is `None`.
- `s` is a list containing the characters `[cs[r][c], cs[r][c]]`.

After executing `c = int(it.next())`:
- `c` is now assigned the integer value of the next character from the iterator `it`.
- The values of `func`, `cs`, `it`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid, `r` is the integer value of the next character from the iterator `it`, `c` is the integer value of the next character from the iterator `it`, `s` is a list containing the characters `[cs[r][c], cs[r][c]]`**.
