In the provided code snippet, the `try` block attempts to create an iterator `it` from the input provided via `raw_input()`. The `except` block handles a `ValueError`, which can occur if `raw_input()` cannot convert the input into a valid form (e.g., if the input is not a string or if `strip()` fails due to an unexpected type).

However, there are a few issues to note:
- The `break` statement in the `except` block is intended to exit a loop, but since this code snippet is not within a loop, using `break` here would result in a `SyntaxError`.
- The initial state mentions that `func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, but the code snippet directly uses `raw_input()`, which suggests that `func` might be part of a larger context not shown in the snippet.
- The mention of `cs` and the handling of `IndexError` and `StopIteration` in the initial state are not reflected in the provided code snippet, which only shows the `try` block for creating the iterator `it`.

Given these points, let's summarize the program's state after the complete execution of the `try` statement:

1. **Try Block Execution:**
   - The program attempts to read input from `stdin` and strip any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - It then creates an iterator `it` over the characters of the input string if the input is valid.

2. **Except Block Execution:**
   - If a `ValueError` occurs during the execution of `raw_input().strip()`, the program attempts to use `break`, which is invalid outside a loop and would result in a `SyntaxError`.

3. **Final Program State:**
   - `func` is expected to read input from `stdin`.
   - `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion.
   - `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid.
   - If a `ValueError` occurs, the program will raise a `SyntaxError` due to the invalid `break` statement.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid. If a `ValueError` occurs, the program will raise a `SyntaxError` due to the invalid `break` statement.**
