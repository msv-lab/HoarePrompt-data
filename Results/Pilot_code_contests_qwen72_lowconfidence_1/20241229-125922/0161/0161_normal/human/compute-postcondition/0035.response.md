The provided code initializes two variables, `r` and `c`, to `None`. This does not affect the values of `func`, `cs`, or `it`, which remain as described in the initial state. No operations are performed that would alter these variables or cause any side effects.

Output State: **`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid. If a `ValueError` occurs, the program will raise a `SyntaxError` due to the invalid `break` statement, `r` is `None`, `c` is `None`.**
