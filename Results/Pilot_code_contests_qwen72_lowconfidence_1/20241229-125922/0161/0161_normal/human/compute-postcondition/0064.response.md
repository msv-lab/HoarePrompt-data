In the given code snippet, a `ValueError` might occur during the execution of `it = iter(raw_input().strip())` if the input from `stdin` cannot be processed correctly, leading to an invalid operation when attempting to create an iterator from the stripped input.

The `try` block attempts to read input from `stdin`, strip any leading or trailing whitespace, and then create an iterator (`it`) over the characters of the input string. If the input is valid and no exceptions are raised, the program continues with `it` being an iterator over the characters of the input string, and `r` and `c` remain `None` if they were `None` initially.

If a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the input from `stdin` is invalid (e.g., the input is not a string that can be iterated over), the `except` block is executed. In this case, the `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the state of the program undefined beyond this point.

Summarizing the `try`-`except` statement:
- The `try` block ensures that `it` is set to an iterator over the characters of the input string if the input is valid.
- The `except` block handles the case where the input is invalid by breaking out of the current loop or if statement, leaving the state of the program undefined.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`func` is expected to read input from `stdin`, `cs` is a dictionary mapping integers 1 through 6 to lists of characters for conversion. If the input is valid, `it` is an iterator over the characters of the input string, and `r` and `c` remain `None` if they were `None` initially. If a `ValueError` occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of the program is undefined.**
