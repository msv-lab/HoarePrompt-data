You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: One day, Taro received a strange email with only the number "519345213244" in the text. The email was from my cousin, who was 10 years older than me, so when I called and asked, "Oh, I sent it with a pocket bell because I was in a hurry. It's convenient. Nice to meet you!" I got it. You know this cousin, who is always busy and a little bit aggressive, and when you have no choice but to research "pager hitting" yourself, you can see that it is a method of input that prevailed in the world about 10 years ago. I understand.

In "Pokebell Strike", enter one character with two numbers, such as 11 for "A" and 15 for "O" according to the conversion table shown in Fig. 1. For example, to enter the string "Naruto", type "519345". Therefore, any letter can be entered with two numbers.

When mobile phones weren't widespread, high school students used this method to send messages from payphones to their friends' pagers. Some high school girls were able to pager at a tremendous speed. Recently, my cousin, who has been busy with work, has unknowingly started typing emails with a pager.

Therefore, in order to help Taro who is having a hard time deciphering every time, please write a program that converts the pager message into a character string and outputs it. However, the conversion table shown in Fig. 2 is used for conversion, and only lowercase letters, ".", "?", "!", And blanks are targeted. Output NA for messages that contain characters that cannot be converted.

Input

Multiple messages are given. One message (up to 200 characters) is given on each line. The total number of messages does not exceed 50.

Output

For each message, output the converted message or NA on one line.

Example

Input
