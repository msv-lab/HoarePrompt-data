Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where each line contains a message (a string of up to 200 characters) composed of digits. The total number of messages does not exceed 50. Each message should be processed to convert it into a character string based on a predefined conversion table, or output "NA" if the message contains characters that cannot be converted.**
