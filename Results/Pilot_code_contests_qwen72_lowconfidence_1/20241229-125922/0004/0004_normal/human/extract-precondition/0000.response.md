Precondition: **x is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ (n(n-1))/2, and n is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation. BITTree is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, where BITTree[i] stores the sum of a segment of the array.**
