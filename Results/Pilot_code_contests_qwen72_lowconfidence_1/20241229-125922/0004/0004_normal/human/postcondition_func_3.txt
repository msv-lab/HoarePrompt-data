The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers representing a restored permutation. It prints the elements of `arr` as a space-separated string followed by a newline character. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `arr` remains unchanged, and the only observable effect is the printed output. Potential edge cases include an empty `arr`, which would result in an empty line being printed, and non-integer elements in `arr`, which would be converted to strings and included in the output.
