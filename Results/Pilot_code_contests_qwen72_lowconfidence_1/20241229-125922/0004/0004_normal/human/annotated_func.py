#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters and is intended to read an integer from standard input, which should represent the size of the permutation n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}.
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program returns an integer that represents the size of the permutation n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from standard input, which is expected to represent the size of a permutation `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function then returns this integer `n`. If the input is not a valid integer or is outside the specified range, the behavior is undefined.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is designed to read input from stdin, which is expected to be a space-separated string of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that converts each element from a space-separated string of integers (read from stdin) into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), which is expected to be a space-separated string of integers. It then converts each substring in the split result into an integer and returns an iterator that yields these integers. If the input is not a valid space-separated string of integers, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle any other types of input or edge cases, such as empty input or non-integer values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}.
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. It writes the string representation of `n` followed by a newline character to the standard output (stdout). The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the string representation of `n` will have been printed to the console, and the program state will remain unchanged except for the side effect of the output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the restored permutation.
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers representing a restored permutation. It prints the elements of `arr` as a space-separated string followed by a newline character. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `arr` remains unchanged, and the only observable effect is the printed output. Potential edge cases include an empty `arr`, which would result in an empty line being printed, and non-integer elements in `arr`, which would be converted to strings and included in the output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_5` does not take any parameters.
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `int` function to each element in the list obtained by splitting the input read from `stdin` by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from standard input (`stdin`), splits the input string by whitespace, and returns a map object that applies the `int` function to each element of the resulting list. The returned map object can be iterated over to obtain the converted integers. If the input contains non-integer values, the `int` function will raise a `ValueError`. If no input is provided, the function will return a map object that can be iterated over, but it will yield no elements.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the length of the permutation.
def func_6(i):
    s = 0
    i = i + 1
    while i > 0:
        s += BITTree[i]
        
        i -= i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `s` is the sum of `BITTree[j]` for all `j` in the sequence generated by repeatedly subtracting `j & -j` from the initial value of `i` until `i` becomes 0, `n` is the length of the permutation
    return s
    #The program returns the sum of `BITTree[j]` for all `j` in the sequence generated by repeatedly subtracting `j & -j` from the initial value of `i` (which is 0) until `i` becomes 0. Since `i` starts at 0 and the operation `j & -j` would not change it (as 0 & -0 is 0), the sequence does not generate any valid indices for `BITTree`, and thus `s` remains 0. Therefore, the program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes a non-negative integer `i` as input, where `0 <= i < n` and `n` is the length of the `BITTree` array. It returns the sum of elements in `BITTree` starting from index `i+1` and moving backwards by repeatedly subtracting `i & -i` until `i` becomes 0. If `i` is 0, the function will return 0 because no valid indices will be generated. For any other valid input, the function will return the cumulative sum of the specified elements in `BITTree`. The function does not modify any external state or variables.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, v is an integer, and n is a positive integer such that 0 <= i <= n.
def func_7(i, v):
    i += 1
    while i <= n:
        BITTree[i] += v
        
        i += i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the smallest value greater than `n` that can be reached by repeatedly adding `i & -i` to the initial value of `i`, `v` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer such that `0 <= i-1 <= n`, `BITTree[i_initial]`, `BITTree[i_initial + (i_initial & -i_initial)]`, `BITTree[i_initial + 2 * (i_initial & -i_initial)]`, etc., up to the last valid index, are each incremented by `v`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7(i, v)` accepts two parameters: `i`, a non-negative integer, and `v`, an integer. It increments the values in a Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) starting from index `i` (after incrementing `i` by 1) until `i` exceeds `n`. The function updates the BITTree by adding `v` to the elements at indices `i`, `i + (i & -i)`, `i + 2 * (i & -i)`, and so on, up to the largest valid index within the range `[1, n]`. After the function completes, the state of the program is such that the BITTree has been updated with the specified increments, and `i` is the smallest value greater than `n` that can be reached by repeatedly adding `i & -i` to the initial value of `i`. The function does not return any value. Edge cases to consider include when `i` is already greater than `n` before the loop starts, in which case no updates are made to the BITTree.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ (n(n-1))/2, and n is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation. BITTree is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, where BITTree[i] stores the sum of a segment of the array.
def func_8(x):
    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `ret` is the largest integer such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `x`, `sm` is the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree`, `i` is -1, `pw` is 1.
    return ret
    #The program returns `ret`, which is the largest integer such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `x`. Here, `x` is a non-negative integer within the range \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, and `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` takes a non-negative integer `x` within the range \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) and returns the largest integer `ret` such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `x`. The `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree. The function iterates through powers of 2 from 2^20 down to 2^0, checking if adding the current power to `ret` and the corresponding value in `BITTree` would still keep the sum `sm` within the limit `x`. If so, it updates `ret` and `sm` accordingly. The function ensures that `ret` is the largest possible value satisfying the condition, and the final state of the program includes `x` remaining unchanged, `n` unchanged, and `BITTree` unchanged. Edge cases include when `x` is 0 (resulting in `ret` being 0) and when `x` is the maximum possible value (resulting in `ret` being the largest index in `BITTree` that satisfies the condition).
