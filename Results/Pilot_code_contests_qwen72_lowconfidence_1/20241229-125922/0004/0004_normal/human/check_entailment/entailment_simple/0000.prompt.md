You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An array of integers p_{1},p_{2}, …,p_{n} is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5] and [4,3,1,2]. The following arrays are not permutations: [2], [1,1], [2,3,4].

There is a hidden permutation of length n.

For each index i, you are given s_{i}, which equals to the sum of all p_{j} such that j < i and p_{j} < p_{i}. In other words, s_i is the sum of elements before the i-th element that are smaller than the i-th element.

Your task is to restore the permutation.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the size of the permutation.

The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)).

It is guaranteed that the array s corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.

Output

Print n integers p_{1}, p_{2}, …, p_{n} — the elements of the restored permutation. We can show that the answer is always unique.

Examples

Input


3
0 0 0


Output


3 2 1


Input


2
0 1


Output


1 2


Input


5
0 1 1 1 10


Output


1 4 3 2 5

Note

In the first example for each i there is no index j satisfying both conditions, hence s_i are always 0.

In the second example for i = 2 it happens that j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = p_1.

In the third example for i = 2, 3, 4 only j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = s_3 = s_4 = 1. For i = 5 all j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible, so s_5 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 10.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
from itertools import permutations, combinations

raw_input = stdin.readline
pr = stdout.write
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
range = xrange
n = func_1()
BITTree = [0] * (n + 1)
l = func_2()
for i in range(n):
    func_7(i, i)
ans = [0] * n
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    ans[i] = func_8(l[i])
    func_7(ans[i], -ans[i])
func_4(ans)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters and is intended to read an integer from standard input, which should represent the size of the permutation n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}.
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program returns an integer that represents the size of the permutation n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is designed to read input from stdin, which is expected to be a space-separated string of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that converts each element from a space-separated string of integers (read from stdin) into an integer.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}.
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the restored permutation.
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_5` does not take any parameters.
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `int` function to each element in the list obtained by splitting the input read from `stdin` by whitespace.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the length of the permutation.
def func_6(i):
    s = 0
    i = i + 1
    while i > 0:
        s += BITTree[i]
        
        i -= i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `s` is the sum of `BITTree[j]` for all `j` in the sequence generated by repeatedly subtracting `j & -j` from the initial value of `i` until `i` becomes 0, `n` is the length of the permutation
    return s
    #The program returns the sum of `BITTree[j]` for all `j` in the sequence generated by repeatedly subtracting `j & -j` from the initial value of `i` (which is 0) until `i` becomes 0. Since `i` starts at 0 and the operation `j & -j` would not change it (as 0 & -0 is 0), the sequence does not generate any valid indices for `BITTree`, and thus `s` remains 0. Therefore, the program returns 0.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, v is an integer, and n is a positive integer such that 0 <= i <= n.
def func_7(i, v):
    i += 1
    while i <= n:
        BITTree[i] += v
        
        i += i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the smallest value greater than `n` that can be reached by repeatedly adding `i & -i` to the initial value of `i`, `v` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer such that `0 <= i-1 <= n`, `BITTree[i_initial]`, `BITTree[i_initial + (i_initial & -i_initial)]`, `BITTree[i_initial + 2 * (i_initial & -i_initial)]`, etc., up to the last valid index, are each incremented by `v`.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ (n(n-1))/2, and n is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation. BITTree is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, where BITTree[i] stores the sum of a segment of the array.
def func_8(x):
    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `ret` is the largest integer such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `x`, `sm` is the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree`, `i` is -1, `pw` is 1.
    return ret
    #The program returns `ret`, which is the largest integer such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `x`. Here, `x` is a non-negative integer within the range \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, and `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
