### Analysis of the Program

#### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires restoring a permutation from a given array of sums. Specifically, for a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \), the array \( s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n \) is defined such that \( s_i \) is the sum of all \( p_j \) where \( j < i \) and \( p_j < p_i \). The task is to reconstruct the permutation \( p \).

#### Program Structure and Functions
1. **func_1**: Reads the size of the permutation \( n \).
2. **func_2**: Reads the array \( s \) of sums.
3. **func_3**: Writes an integer to the output.
4. **func_4**: Writes the reconstructed permutation to the output.
5. **func_5**: Reads a list of integers from the input.
6. **func_6**: Computes the prefix sum using a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT).
7. **func_7**: Updates the BIT.
8. **func_8**: Finds the position in the permutation corresponding to a given sum.

#### Detailed Function Analysis
1. **func_1**:
   - Reads an integer \( n \) from the input.
   - Correctly reads the size of the permutation.

2. **func_2**:
   - Reads a list of integers \( s \) from the input.
   - Correctly reads the array of sums.

3. **func_3**:
   - Writes an integer to the output.
   - Not directly used in the main logic but is defined.

4. **func_4**:
   - Writes the reconstructed permutation to the output.
   - Correctly formats and prints the result.

5. **func_5**:
   - Reads a list of integers from the input.
   - Not directly used in the main logic but is defined.

6. **func_6**:
   - Computes the prefix sum using a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT).
   - Correctly computes the prefix sum for a given index.

7. **func_7**:
   - Updates the BIT.
   - Correctly updates the BIT for a given index and value.

8. **func_8**:
   - Finds the position in the permutation corresponding to a given sum.
   - Correctly finds the position using binary search and the BIT.

#### Main Logic
- Initializes a BIT of size \( n+1 \).
- Reads the array \( s \).
- Updates the BIT with initial values.
- Reconstructs the permutation by iterating from the end to the beginning of the array \( s \).
- Uses the BIT to find the correct position for each element in the permutation.
- Updates the BIT to reflect the placement of the current element.
- Prints the reconstructed permutation.

#### Correctness Verification
- The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary data structures.
- The BIT is used effectively to keep track of the positions and sums.
- The reconstruction process iterates backward through the array \( s \), ensuring that the correct position is found for each element.
- The final permutation is printed in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reconstructs the permutation from the given array of sums and follows the problem description accurately.
