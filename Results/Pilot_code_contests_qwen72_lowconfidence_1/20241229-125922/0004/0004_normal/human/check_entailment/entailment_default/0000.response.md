Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to restore the permutation from the given sums. Let's break down the key parts and verify each step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` reads the size of the permutation `n`.
   - `func_2()` reads the list of sums `s`.

2. **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) Initialization:**
   - A BITTree of size `n + 1` is initialized to store the prefix sums.

3. **Restoring the Permutation:**
   - The main logic is implemented in the loop where the permutation is restored from the sums.
   - For each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
     - `func_8(l[i])` is used to find the largest integer `ret` such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `l[i]`.
     - This integer `ret` is the value of the permutation at index `i`.
     - The value `ret` is then subtracted from the `BITTree` using `func_7(ret, -ret)` to update the prefix sums.

4. **Output:**
   - The restored permutation is printed using `func_4(ans)`.

### Verification of Key Functions:
- **`func_1` and `func_2`:** These functions correctly read the input as specified.
- **`func_6` and `func_7`:** These functions correctly manage the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) for prefix sum queries and updates.
- **`func_8`:** This function correctly finds the largest integer `ret` that satisfies the condition using binary search on the powers of 2.

### Edge Cases:
- The code handles the edge case where the input is the smallest possible permutation (e.g., `n = 1`).
- The code also handles larger inputs up to the specified limit (e.g., `n = 2 * 10^5`).

### Examples:
- For the input `3` and `0 0 0`, the output is `3 2 1`, which is correct.
- For the input `2` and `0 1`, the output is `1 2`, which is correct.
- For the input `5` and `0 1 1 1 10`, the output is `1 4 3 2 5`, which is correct.

Since the code correctly handles all potential cases and the provided examples, the program is correct.
