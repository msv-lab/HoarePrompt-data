You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An array of integers p_{1},p_{2}, …,p_{n} is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5] and [4,3,1,2]. The following arrays are not permutations: [2], [1,1], [2,3,4].

There is a hidden permutation of length n.

For each index i, you are given s_{i}, which equals to the sum of all p_{j} such that j < i and p_{j} < p_{i}. In other words, s_i is the sum of elements before the i-th element that are smaller than the i-th element.

Your task is to restore the permutation.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the size of the permutation.

The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)).

It is guaranteed that the array s corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.

Output

Print n integers p_{1}, p_{2}, …, p_{n} — the elements of the restored permutation. We can show that the answer is always unique.

Examples

Input


3
0 0 0


Output


3 2 1


Input


2
0 1


Output


1 2


Input


5
0 1 1 1 10


Output


1 4 3 2 5

Note

In the first example for each i there is no index j satisfying both conditions, hence s_i are always 0.

In the second example for i = 2 it happens that j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = p_1.

In the third example for i = 2, 3, 4 only j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = s_3 = s_4 = 1. For i = 5 all j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible, so s_5 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 10.
Functions with output description for each function:
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
from itertools import permutations, combinations

raw_input = stdin.readline
pr = stdout.write
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
range = xrange
n = func_1()
BITTree = [0] * (n + 1)
l = func_2()
for i in range(n):
    func_7(i, i)
ans = [0] * n
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    ans[i] = func_8(l[i])
    func_7(ans[i], -ans[i])
func_4(ans)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from standard input, which is expected to represent the size of a permutation `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function then returns this integer `n`. If the input is not a valid integer or is outside the specified range, the behavior is undefined.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), which is expected to be a space-separated string of integers. It then converts each substring in the split result into an integer and returns an iterator that yields these integers. If the input is not a valid space-separated string of integers, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle any other types of input or edge cases, such as empty input or non-integer values.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. It writes the string representation of `n` followed by a newline character to the standard output (stdout). The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the string representation of `n` will have been printed to the console, and the program state will remain unchanged except for the side effect of the output.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers representing a restored permutation. It prints the elements of `arr` as a space-separated string followed by a newline character. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `arr` remains unchanged, and the only observable effect is the printed output. Potential edge cases include an empty `arr`, which would result in an empty line being printed, and non-integer elements in `arr`, which would be converted to strings and included in the output.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from standard input (`stdin`), splits the input string by whitespace, and returns a map object that applies the `int` function to each element of the resulting list. The returned map object can be iterated over to obtain the converted integers. If the input contains non-integer values, the `int` function will raise a `ValueError`. If no input is provided, the function will return a map object that can be iterated over, but it will yield no elements.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(i):
    s = 0
    i = i + 1
    while i > 0:
        s += BITTree[i]
        i -= i & -i
    return s
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` takes a non-negative integer `i` as input, where `0 <= i < n` and `n` is the length of the `BITTree` array. It returns the sum of elements in `BITTree` starting from index `i+1` and moving backwards by repeatedly subtracting `i & -i` until `i` becomes 0. If `i` is 0, the function will return 0 because no valid indices will be generated. For any other valid input, the function will return the cumulative sum of the specified elements in `BITTree`. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(i, v):
    i += 1
    while i <= n:
        BITTree[i] += v
        i += i & -i
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7(i, v)` accepts two parameters: `i`, a non-negative integer, and `v`, an integer. It increments the values in a Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) starting from index `i` (after incrementing `i` by 1) until `i` exceeds `n`. The function updates the BITTree by adding `v` to the elements at indices `i`, `i + (i & -i)`, `i + 2 * (i & -i)`, and so on, up to the largest valid index within the range `[1, n]`. After the function completes, the state of the program is such that the BITTree has been updated with the specified increments, and `i` is the smallest value greater than `n` that can be reached by repeatedly adding `i & -i` to the initial value of `i`. The function does not return any value. Edge cases to consider include when `i` is already greater than `n` before the loop starts, in which case no updates are made to the BITTree.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x):
    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
    return ret
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` takes a non-negative integer `x` within the range \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) and returns the largest integer `ret` such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `x`. The `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree. The function iterates through powers of 2 from 2^20 down to 2^0, checking if adding the current power to `ret` and the corresponding value in `BITTree` would still keep the sum `sm` within the limit `x`. If so, it updates `ret` and `sm` accordingly. The function ensures that `ret` is the largest possible value satisfying the condition, and the final state of the program includes `x` remaining unchanged, `n` unchanged, and `BITTree` unchanged. Edge cases include when `x` is 0 (resulting in `ret` being 0) and when `x` is the maximum possible value (resulting in `ret` being the largest index in `BITTree` that satisfies the condition).



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
