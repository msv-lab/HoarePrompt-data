You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An array of integers p_{1},p_{2}, …,p_{n} is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5] and [4,3,1,2]. The following arrays are not permutations: [2], [1,1], [2,3,4].

There is a hidden permutation of length n.

For each index i, you are given s_{i}, which equals to the sum of all p_{j} such that j < i and p_{j} < p_{i}. In other words, s_i is the sum of elements before the i-th element that are smaller than the i-th element.

Your task is to restore the permutation.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the size of the permutation.

The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)).

It is guaranteed that the array s corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.

Output

Print n integers p_{1}, p_{2}, …, p_{n} — the elements of the restored permutation. We can show that the answer is always unique.

Examples

Input


3
0 0 0


Output


3 2 1


Input


2
0 1


Output


1 2


Input


5
0 1 1 1 10


Output


1 4 3 2 5

Note

In the first example for each i there is no index j satisfying both conditions, hence s_i are always 0.

In the second example for i = 2 it happens that j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = p_1.

In the third example for i = 2, 3, 4 only j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = s_3 = s_4 = 1. For i = 5 all j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible, so s_5 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 10.

        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
    return ret

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program is incomplete and lacks the main logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires restoring a permutation based on the sums of elements that are smaller and come before each element in the permutation. However, the provided functions do not contain the necessary logic to achieve this. Specifically:

1. **func_1()**: Reads a single integer from standard input. This is likely used to read `n`.
2. **func_2()**: Reads a list of integers from standard input. This is likely used to read the array `s`.
3. **func_3(n)**: Writes a single integer to standard output. This is not used in the context of the problem.
4. **func_4(arr)**: Writes a list of integers to standard output. This could be used to print the final permutation.
5. **func_5()**: Reads a list of integers from standard input. This is another way to read the array `s`.
6. **func_6(i)**: This function appears to be part of a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) implementation, but it is not clear how it is used in the context of the problem.
7. **func_7(i, v)**: Another part of the BIT implementation, but its usage is unclear.
8. **func_8(x)**: Another part of the BIT implementation, but its usage is unclear.

The program lacks the main logic to process the input and generate the permutation. Without this logic, the program cannot correctly solve the problem for any input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_8` takes a non-negative integer `x` within the range \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) and returns the largest integer `ret` such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `x`. The `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree. The function iterates through powers of 2 from 2^20 down to 2^0, checking if adding the current power to `ret` and the corresponding value in `BITTree` would still keep the sum `sm` within the limit `x`. If so, it updates `ret` and `sm` accordingly. The function ensures that `ret` is the largest possible value satisfying the condition, and the final state of the program includes `x` remaining unchanged, `n` unchanged, and `BITTree` unchanged. Edge cases include when `x` is 0 (resulting in `ret` being 0) and when `x` is the maximum possible value (resulting in `ret` being the largest index in `BITTree` that satisfies the condition).+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
