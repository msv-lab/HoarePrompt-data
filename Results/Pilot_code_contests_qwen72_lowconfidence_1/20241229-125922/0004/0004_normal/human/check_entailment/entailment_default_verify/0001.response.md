Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program is indeed incomplete and does not contain the main logic required to solve the problem as described. While the functions `func_1` to `func_8` are defined, they are not used in a coherent manner to read the input, process the data, and output the restored permutation. The problem description requires a specific sequence of steps to restore the permutation from the given sums, and the provided code does not implement these steps. The output hints for `func_8` provide insight into its functionality, but they do not compensate for the lack of a main function or loop that ties everything together to solve the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for any potential case.
