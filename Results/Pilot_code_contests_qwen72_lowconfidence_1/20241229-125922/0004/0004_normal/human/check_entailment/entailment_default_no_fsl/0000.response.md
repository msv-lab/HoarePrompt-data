Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the algorithm for restoring a permutation from the given sums. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` reads the size of the permutation `n`.
   - `func_2()` reads the list of sums `s`.

2. **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) Initialization:**
   - A BIT (or Fenwick Tree) is initialized with size `n + 1` to help efficiently manage the cumulative sums.

3. **Updating the BIT:**
   - `func_7(i, v)` updates the BIT by adding `v` to the appropriate indices. This function is used to maintain the cumulative sums as elements are placed in the permutation.

4. **Finding the Permutation Elements:**
   - `func_8(x)` finds the largest index `ret` such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the BIT is less than or equal to `x`. This function is crucial for determining the correct position of each element in the permutation.

5. **Restoring the Permutation:**
   - The main loop iterates from the end of the permutation to the beginning. For each index `i`, it uses `func_8(s[i])` to find the correct element and then updates the BIT to reflect the placement of this element.

6. **Output:**
   - `func_4(ans)` prints the restored permutation as a space-separated string.

The code handles all the required steps and edge cases as described in the problem statement. The use of the BIT ensures efficient updates and queries, and the logic for finding the correct elements is sound. The provided examples and the structure of the code suggest that it will work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
