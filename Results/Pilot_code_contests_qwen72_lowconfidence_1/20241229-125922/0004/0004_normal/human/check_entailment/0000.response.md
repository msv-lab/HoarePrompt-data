Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program is incomplete and lacks the main logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires restoring a permutation based on the sums of elements that are smaller and come before each element in the permutation. However, the provided functions do not contain the necessary logic to achieve this. Specifically:

1. **func_1()**: Reads a single integer from standard input. This is likely used to read `n`.
2. **func_2()**: Reads a list of integers from standard input. This is likely used to read the array `s`.
3. **func_3(n)**: Writes a single integer to standard output. This is not used in the context of the problem.
4. **func_4(arr)**: Writes a list of integers to standard output. This could be used to print the final permutation.
5. **func_5()**: Reads a list of integers from standard input. This is another way to read the array `s`.
6. **func_6(i)**: This function appears to be part of a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) implementation, but it is not clear how it is used in the context of the problem.
7. **func_7(i, v)**: Another part of the BIT implementation, but its usage is unclear.
8. **func_8(x)**: Another part of the BIT implementation, but its usage is unclear.

The program lacks the main logic to process the input and generate the permutation. Without this logic, the program cannot correctly solve the problem for any input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
