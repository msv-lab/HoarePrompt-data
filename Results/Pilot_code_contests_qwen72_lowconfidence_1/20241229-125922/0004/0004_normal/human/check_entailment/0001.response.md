Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not contain the main logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the functions `func_1` to `func_8` are defined but not used in a way that would solve the problem of restoring the permutation from the given sums. The program lacks the main function or loop that would read the input, process the data using the defined functions, and output the result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for any potential case.
