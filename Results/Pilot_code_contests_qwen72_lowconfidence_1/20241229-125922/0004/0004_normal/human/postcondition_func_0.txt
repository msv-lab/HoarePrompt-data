The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from standard input, which is expected to represent the size of a permutation `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function then returns this integer `n`. If the input is not a valid integer or is outside the specified range, the behavior is undefined.
