The function `func_3` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. It writes the string representation of `n` followed by a newline character to the standard output (stdout). The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the string representation of `n` will have been printed to the console, and the program state will remain unchanged except for the side effect of the output.
