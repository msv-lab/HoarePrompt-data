The function `func_6` takes a non-negative integer `i` as input, where `0 <= i < n` and `n` is the length of the `BITTree` array. It returns the sum of elements in `BITTree` starting from index `i+1` and moving backwards by repeatedly subtracting `i & -i` until `i` becomes 0. If `i` is 0, the function will return 0 because no valid indices will be generated. For any other valid input, the function will return the cumulative sum of the specified elements in `BITTree`. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
