The function `ni()` is not defined in the provided context. However, based on the problem description, the input to the function that would solve this problem would be an integer `n` and a list of integers `s` of length `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}` and `0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)`. It is guaranteed that the array `s` corresponds to a valid permutation of length `n`.
