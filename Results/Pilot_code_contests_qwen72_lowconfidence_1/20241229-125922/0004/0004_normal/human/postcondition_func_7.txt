The function `func_8` takes a non-negative integer `x` within the range \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) and returns the largest integer `ret` such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `x`. The `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree. The function iterates through powers of 2 from 2^20 down to 2^0, checking if adding the current power to `ret` and the corresponding value in `BITTree` would still keep the sum `sm` within the limit `x`. If so, it updates `ret` and `sm` accordingly. The function ensures that `ret` is the largest possible value satisfying the condition, and the final state of the program includes `x` remaining unchanged, `n` unchanged, and `BITTree` unchanged. Edge cases include when `x` is 0 (resulting in `ret` being 0) and when `x` is the maximum possible value (resulting in `ret` being the largest index in `BITTree` that satisfies the condition).
