The function `func_7(i, v)` accepts two parameters: `i`, a non-negative integer, and `v`, an integer. It increments the values in a Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) starting from index `i` (after incrementing `i` by 1) until `i` exceeds `n`. The function updates the BITTree by adding `v` to the elements at indices `i`, `i + (i & -i)`, `i + 2 * (i & -i)`, and so on, up to the largest valid index within the range `[1, n]`. After the function completes, the state of the program is such that the BITTree has been updated with the specified increments, and `i` is the smallest value greater than `n` that can be reached by repeatedly adding `i & -i` to the initial value of `i`. The function does not return any value. Edge cases to consider include when `i` is already greater than `n` before the loop starts, in which case no updates are made to the BITTree.
