The code snippet `ret += pw` updates the value of `ret` by adding the value of `pw` to it. Given the initial state:

- `ret` = 0
- `pw` = 2,097,152
- The condition \(ret + pw \leq n\) is satisfied, meaning \(0 + 2,097,152 \leq n\).

After executing the code snippet, the new value of `ret` is \(0 + 2,097,152 = 2,097,152\). The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged, including the range of `x`, the value of `n`, the structure of `BITTree`, the value of `sm`, and the value of `i`.

The updated state also maintains the condition \(ret + pw \leq n\), which now translates to \(2,097,152 + 2,097,152 \leq n\). Additionally, the condition \(sm + BITTree[ret + pw] \leq x\) remains valid, with the new value of `ret` being used in the calculation.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `ret` = 2,097,152, `sm` = 0, `i` is 21, `pw` = 2,097,152, and the current values satisfy \(ret + pw \leq n\) and \(sm + BITTree[ret + pw] \leq x\)**
