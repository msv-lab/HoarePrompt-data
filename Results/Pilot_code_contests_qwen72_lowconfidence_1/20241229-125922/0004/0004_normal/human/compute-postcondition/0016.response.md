The value of `sm` is updated by adding the value of `BITTree[ret]` to it. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `i`, `pw`, `ret`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `i` is 19, `pw` is 524,288, `ret` is `ret + 524,288`, `sm` is `sm + BITTree[ret]`.**
