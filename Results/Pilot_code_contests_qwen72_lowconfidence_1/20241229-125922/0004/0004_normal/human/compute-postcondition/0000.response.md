The variable `ret` is initialized to 0. This initialization does not affect the values of `x`, `n`, or the list `BITTree`.

Output State: **x is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ (n(n-1))/2, n is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, BITTree is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, ret = 0**
