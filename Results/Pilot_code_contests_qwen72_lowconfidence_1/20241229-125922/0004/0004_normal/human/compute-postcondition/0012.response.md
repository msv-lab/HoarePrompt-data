Postcondition: ***`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `i` is 20, `pw` is 1,048,576. If `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `ret` is updated to `ret + 1,048,576` and `sm` is updated to `sm + BITTree[ret]`. Otherwise, `ret` and `sm` remain unchanged.***
