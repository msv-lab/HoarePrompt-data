The value of `ret` is incremented by the value of `pw`, which is 1,048,576. The values of other variables (`x`, `n`, `BITTree`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. The conditions for setting `ret` and `sm` are not re-evaluated in this snippet, so their potential changes mentioned in the initial state do not occur here.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `i` is 20, `pw` is 1,048,576, `ret` is `ret + 1,048,576`, `sm` remains unchanged.**
