To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop step by step, considering the initial state and the changes that occur during each iteration.

### Initial State:
- `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
- `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation.
- `BITTree` is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree.
- `ret` is initialized to 0.
- `sm` is initialized to 0.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates from `i = 21` down to `i = 0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time. For each iteration:
- `pw` is calculated as \(2^i\).
- The loop checks if `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n` and if `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`.
- If both conditions are true, `ret` is incremented by `pw` and `sm` is incremented by `BITTree[ret]`.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all 22 iterations (from `i = 21` to `i = 0`), the following will be true:

- `ret` will be the largest integer such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `x`.
- `sm` will be the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree`.
- `i` will be -1, indicating the loop has completed.
- `pw` will be 1, as the last iteration sets `pw` to \(2^0 = 1\).

### Summary:
The loop essentially finds the largest `ret` such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `x`. This is a common operation in Binary Indexed Trees (BIT) or Fenwick Trees used to find the largest index whose cumulative sum is less than or equal to a given value.

### Output State:
**`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `ret` is the largest integer such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `x`, `sm` is the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree`, `i` is -1, `pw` is 1.**
