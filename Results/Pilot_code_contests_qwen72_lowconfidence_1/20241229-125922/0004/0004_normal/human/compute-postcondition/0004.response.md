Postcondition: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `ret` = 0, `sm` = 0, `i` is 21, `pw` = 2,097,152, and the current values satisfy \(ret + pw \leq n\) and \(sm + BITTree[ret + pw] \leq x\)**.
