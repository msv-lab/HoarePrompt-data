The value of `ret` is incremented by the value of `pw`. Given that `pw` is 524,288, `ret` will now be `ret + 524,288`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `i` is 19, `pw` is 524,288, `ret` is `ret + 524,288`, `sm` remains unchanged.**
