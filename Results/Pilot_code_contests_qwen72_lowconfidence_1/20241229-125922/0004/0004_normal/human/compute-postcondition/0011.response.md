The code snippet updates the variable `sm` by adding the value at index `ret` in the `BITTree` list to it. Given the initial state:

- `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\)
- `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation
- `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree
- `i` is 20
- `pw` is 1,048,576
- `ret` is `ret + 1,048,576`
- `sm` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet:

- `sm` is updated to `sm + BITTree[ret]`

Since the exact value of `ret` is not provided explicitly in the initial state, we assume `ret` is a valid index in the `BITTree` list. The value of `ret` is `ret + 1,048,576`, but since `ret` itself is not specified, we treat it as a known value for the purpose of this calculation.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `i` is 20, `pw` is 1,048,576, `ret` is `ret + 1,048,576`, `sm` is `sm + BITTree[ret]`.**
