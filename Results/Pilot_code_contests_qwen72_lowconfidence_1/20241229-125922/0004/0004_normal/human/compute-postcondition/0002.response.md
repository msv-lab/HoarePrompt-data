To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(21, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will iterate from 21 down to 0, inclusive. For this loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:

1. The starting value of the loop (21) must be greater than or equal to the ending value (-1) plus the step size (-1). This condition is always true because the loop is set up to decrement `i` from 21 to 0, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\)
- `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation
- `BITTree` is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree
- `ret` = 0
- `sm` = 0

The loop itself does not depend on these variables directly. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `x`, `n`, `BITTree`, `ret`, and `sm` because the loop's range is fixed and always valid.

However, to ensure the loop can execute and to provide a complete state, we should include the initial value of `i`:

State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `ret` = 0, `sm` = 0, `i` is 21**
