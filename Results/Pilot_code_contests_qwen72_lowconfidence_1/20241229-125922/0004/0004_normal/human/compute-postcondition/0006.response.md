The value of `sm` is incremented by the value of `BITTree[ret]`. Given that `ret` is 2,097,152, `sm` is updated to include the value at index 2,097,152 in the `BITTree` list. The states of the other variables (`x`, `n`, `i`, `pw`) remain unchanged, and the conditions \(ret + pw \leq n\) and \(sm + BITTree[ret + pw] \leq x\) continue to hold true.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `ret` = 2,097,152, `sm` = `BITTree[2,097,152]`, `i` is 21, `pw` = 2,097,152, and the current values satisfy \(ret + pw \leq n\) and \(sm + BITTree[ret + pw] \leq x\)**
