Output State: **The program returns `ret`, which is the largest integer such that the sum of the prefix sums up to `ret` in the `BITTree` is less than or equal to `x`. Here, `x` is a non-negative integer within the range \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, and `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree.**
