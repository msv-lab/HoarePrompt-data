Postcondition: ***`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `i` is 21, `pw` = 2,097,152. If `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `ret` is set to 2,097,152 and `sm` is set to `BITTree[2,097,152]`. Otherwise, the values of `ret` and `sm` remain unchanged.***
