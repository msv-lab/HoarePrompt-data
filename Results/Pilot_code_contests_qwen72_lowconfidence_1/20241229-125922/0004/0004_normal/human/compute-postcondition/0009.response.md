The value of `pw` is updated to `1 << i`. Given that `i` is 20, this means `pw` is updated to \(2^{20}\), which is 1,048,576.

The initial conditions for `ret` and `sm` are not directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, they remain unchanged unless the conditions specified in the initial state are met, which are not checked or altered by the given code snippet.

The initial state variables that remain unchanged are:
- `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\)
- `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation
- `BITTree` is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree
- `i` is 20
- The conditions regarding `ret` and `sm` remain as they are, but since no logic is applied here to change them, their potential values are not updated.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `i` is 20, `pw` is 1,048,576, if `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `ret` is set to 1,048,576 and `sm` is set to `BITTree[1,048,576]`. Otherwise, the values of `ret` and `sm` remain unchanged.**
