Postcondition: ***`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers representing a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `i` is 19, `pw` is 524,288, `ret` and `sm` remain unchanged unless the condition `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x` is met, in which case `ret` is updated to `ret + 524,288` and `sm` is updated to `sm + BITTree[ret]`.***
