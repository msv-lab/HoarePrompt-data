The value of `pw` is calculated as `1 << i`. Given that `i` is 21, `pw` will be `1 << 21`, which is equivalent to \(2^{21}\) or 2,097,152. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation, `BITTree` is a list of integers initialized to represent a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree, `ret` = 0, `sm` = 0, `i` is 21, `pw` = 2,097,152**
