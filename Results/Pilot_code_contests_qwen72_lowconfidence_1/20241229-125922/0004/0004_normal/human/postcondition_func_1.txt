The function `func_2` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), which is expected to be a space-separated string of integers. It then converts each substring in the split result into an integer and returns an iterator that yields these integers. If the input is not a valid space-separated string of integers, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle any other types of input or edge cases, such as empty input or non-integer values.
