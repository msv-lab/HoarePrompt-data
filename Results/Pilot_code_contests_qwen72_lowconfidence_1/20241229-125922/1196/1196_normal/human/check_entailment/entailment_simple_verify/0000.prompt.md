You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let a be a matrix of size r × c containing positive integers, not necessarily distinct. Rows of the matrix are numbered from 1 to r, columns are numbered from 1 to c. We can construct an array b consisting of r + c integers as follows: for each i ∈ [1, r], let b_i be the greatest common divisor of integers in the i-th row, and for each j ∈ [1, c] let b_{r+j} be the greatest common divisor of integers in the j-th column. 

We call the matrix diverse if all r + c numbers b_k (k ∈ [1, r + c]) are pairwise distinct. 

The magnitude of a matrix equals to the maximum of b_k.

For example, suppose we have the following matrix:

\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 9 & 7\\\ 4 & 144 & 84 \end{pmatrix} 

We construct the array b:

  1. b_1 is the greatest common divisor of 2, 9, and 7, that is 1; 
  2. b_2 is the greatest common divisor of 4, 144, and 84, that is 4; 
  3. b_3 is the greatest common divisor of 2 and 4, that is 2; 
  4. b_4 is the greatest common divisor of 9 and 144, that is 9; 
  5. b_5 is the greatest common divisor of 7 and 84, that is 7. 



So b = [1, 4, 2, 9, 7]. All values in this array are distinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to 9.

For a given r and c, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. If there are no solutions, output a single integer 0. 

Input

The only line in the input contains two space separated integers r and c (1 ≤ r,c ≤ 500) — the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix to be found.

Output

If there is no solution, output a single integer 0.

Otherwise, output r rows. The i-th of them should contain c space-separated integers, the j-th of which is a_{i,j} — the positive integer in the i-th row and j-th column of a diverse matrix minimizing the magnitude.

Furthermore, it must hold that 1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9. It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is also a solution with this additional constraint (still having minimum possible magnitude).

Examples

Input


2 2


Output


4 12
2 9

Input


1 1


Output


0

Note

In the first example, the GCDs of rows are b_1 = 4 and b_2 = 1, and the GCDs of columns are b_3 = 2 and b_4 = 3. All GCDs are pairwise distinct and the maximum of them is 4. Since the GCDs have to be distinct and at least 1, it is clear that there are no diverse matrices of size 2 × 2 with magnitude smaller than 4.

In the second example, no matter what a_{1,1} is, b_1 = b_2 will always hold, so there are no diverse matrices.
Program:
```
def func():
    (r, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if r == 1 and c == 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        flag = False
        if c == 1:
            flag = True
            (r, c) = (c, r)
        l = [[1 for _ in range(c)] for _ in range(r)]
        b = [i + 1 for i in range(r + c)]
        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                l[i][j] *= b[i] * b[r + j]
        if flag == False:
            for i in range(r):
                s = ''
                for j in range(c):
                    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
                print(s)
        else:
            for j in range(c):
                s = ''
                for i in range(r):
                    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
                print(s)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here’s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Handling the Special Case (1x1 Matrix):**
   - If `r == 1` and `c == 1`, the program correctly outputs `0` because a 1x1 matrix cannot be diverse.

2. **General Case:**
   - The program initializes a matrix `l` with all elements set to 1.
   - It then constructs the array `b` where `b[i]` for `i` in `[0, r-1]` represents the GCD of the i-th row, and `b[r+j]` for `j` in `[0, c-1]` represents the GCD of the j-th column.
   - The program ensures that the GCDs are distinct by using consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - Each element `l[i][j]` in the matrix is set to `b[i] * b[r + j]`, ensuring that the GCD of the i-th row is `b[i]` and the GCD of the j-th column is `b[r + j]`.

3. **Handling Transpose for Column Matrices:**
   - If `c == 1`, the program transposes the matrix to ensure that the logic works correctly for column matrices. This is a valid approach because the problem is symmetric with respect to rows and columns.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the matrix in the required format, ensuring that the constraints `1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9` are met.

Given the above points, the program correctly handles all potential cases and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
