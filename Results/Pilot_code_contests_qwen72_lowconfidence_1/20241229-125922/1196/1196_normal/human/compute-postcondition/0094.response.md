The code snippet `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space to the string `s`.

Given:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `s` is `"r + 3 "`

We need to determine the value of `l[i][j]`:
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.

For `i = 1` and `j = 2`:
- `l[1][2] = b[1] * b[r + 2]`
- Since `b` contains elements from 1 to `r + c`, `b[1]` is 2 and `b[r + 2]` is `r + 2`.

Thus, `l[1][2] = 2 * (r + 2)`.

Now, appending this value to `s`:
- `s += str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' '`

Therefore, the new value of `s` is:
- `s = "r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' '`

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 2, `s` is `"r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' '`, `i` is 1, `s` has been printed (but now `s` is `"r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' '`)**
