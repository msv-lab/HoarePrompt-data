The code `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` appends the string representation of the element at position `[i][j]` in the 2D list `l` followed by a space to the string `s`.

- Initial State:
  - `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500
  - `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500
  - Either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1
  - If `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`
  - `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`
  - `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`
  - `i` is 1
  - `s` is an empty string
  - `j` is 0

- Impact of the Code:
  - The string `s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[1][0]` followed by a space.

- Calculation:
  - `l[1][0]` is calculated as `b[1] * b[r + 0]`, which is `b[1] * b[r]`.
  - Since `b` contains elements from 1 to `r + c`, `b[1]` is 2 and `b[r]` is `r + 1`.
  - Therefore, `l[1][0]` is `2 * (r + 1)`.

- Updated State:
  - `s` is now `"2 * (r + 1) "`

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, if `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `i` is 1, `s` is "2 * (r + 1) ", `j` is 0**
