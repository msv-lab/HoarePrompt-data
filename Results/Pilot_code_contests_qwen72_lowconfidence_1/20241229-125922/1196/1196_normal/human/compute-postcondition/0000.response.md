The code snippet `r, c = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer conversions of these parts to `r` and `c`.

- Before the code executes, `r` and `c` are integers within the range 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500.
- After the code executes, `r` and `c` will be updated to the integer values provided by the user.

Since the exact values provided by the user are not specified, the new values of `r` and `c` are unknown but will still be integers within the range 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500.

Output State: **`r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500, updated to the values provided by the user.**
