To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the code step by step, focusing on the variables and their values after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
- `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- `flag` is `True`.
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- `j` is 1.
- `s` is an empty string.
- `i` is `r - 1`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(r):
    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates `r` times, from `i = 0` to `i = r - 1`.
- For each iteration, the string `s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- `r` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
- `c` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
- `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- `flag` remains `True`.
- `l` remains a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
- `b` remains a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- `j` remains 1.
- `s` will be a string containing the concatenation of the string representations of `l[i][1]` for all `i` from 0 to `r - 1`, separated by spaces.
- `i` will be `r - 1` (since the loop variable `i` is not used outside the loop).

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 1, `s` is a string containing the concatenation of `str(l[i][1])` for all `i` from 0 to `r - 1`, separated by spaces, `i` is `r - 1`.**
