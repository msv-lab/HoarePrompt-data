The code snippet `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` concatenates the string representation of the element `l[i][j]` followed by a space to the string `s`. Given the initial conditions:

- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500
- `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1
- `flag` is `True`
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`
- `j` is 0
- `s` is an empty string
- `i` is 0

Given these conditions, the element `l[0][0]` is `b[0] * b[r + 0]`, which simplifies to `b[0] * b[r]`.

Since `b` contains elements from 1 to `r + c`, `b[0]` is 1 and `b[r]` is `r + 1`.

Therefore, `l[0][0]` is `1 * (r + 1)`, which is `r + 1`.

The string `s` is updated to include the string representation of `l[0][0]` followed by a space.

Thus, `s` becomes `"r + 1 "`.

The output state is:
**`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 0, `s` is `"r + 1 "`, `i` is 0**
