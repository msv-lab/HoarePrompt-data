Postcondition: ***`r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500, and either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1. If `c` == 1, `flag` is `True`; otherwise, `flag` remains `False`. `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`. `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`. If `flag` is `False`, `i` is `r - 1`, `s` is a string containing the space-separated values of `l[r-1][j]` for `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`, `j` is `c - 1`, and the loop has printed `r` lines, each line containing `c` space-separated values corresponding to the elements of `l[i][j]` for the respective `i` in the range 0 to `r-1`. If `flag` is `True`, `c` lines have been printed, each containing the concatenated string representations of `l[i][j]` for all `i` from 0 to `r-1`, separated by spaces, for each `j` from 0 to `c-1`.***
