To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
- Either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- If `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`.
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`.
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is `"b[0] * b[r] b[0] * b[r + 1] ... b[0] * b[r + c - 1] "`.
- `j` is `c - 1`.
- `s` is printed.

### Loop Condition:
```
for i in range(r):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `r`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
- The value of `r` remains unchanged.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- `s` needs to be updated to reflect the new row in the 2D list `l`.

### Updated State:
- `r` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
- `c` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
- Either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- If `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`.
- `l` remains a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`.
- `b` remains a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- `i` is now 1.
- `s` is now `"b[1] * b[r] b[1] * b[r + 1] ... b[1] * b[r + c - 1] "`.
- `j` remains `c - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, if `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `i` is 1, `s` is `"b[1] * b[r] b[1] * b[r + 1] ... b[1] * b[r + c - 1] "`, `j` is `c - 1`**.
