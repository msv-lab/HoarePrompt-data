The given code snippet modifies the string `s` by appending the string representation of the element `l[i][j]` followed by a space `' '`.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500
- Either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1
- If `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`
- `i` is 1
- `s` is "2 * (r + 1)"
- `j` is 1

The code snippet `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `l[1][1]` followed by a space to `s`.

Let's determine the value of `l[1][1]`:
- `l[1][1] = b[1] * b[r + 1]`

Since `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, the elements are:
- `b[1] = 2`
- `b[r + 1] = r + 2`

Thus:
- `l[1][1] = 2 * (r + 2)`

Now, we append this value to `s`:
- `s += str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' '`

So, the new value of `s` is:
- `s = "2 * (r + 1) 2 * (r + 2) "`

The output state is:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500
- Either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1
- If `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`
- `i` is 1
- `s` is "2 * (r + 1) 2 * (r + 2) "
- `j` is 1

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, if `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `i` is 1, `s` is "2 * (r + 1) 2 * (r + 2) ", `j` is 1**
