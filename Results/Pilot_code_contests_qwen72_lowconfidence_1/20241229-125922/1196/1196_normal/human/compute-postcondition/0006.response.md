The value of `flag` is updated to `True`. The conditions regarding `r` and `c` remain unchanged, and the current value of `c` is still 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500, and either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `c` is 1, `flag` is `True`.
Output State: **`r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500, and either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `c` is 1, `flag` is `True`**
