To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the state of the loop variable `j` and the condition under which the loop continues to execute. The loop `for j in range(c):` will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `c`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- `l[1][1]` is now `2 * (r + 2)`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Loop Variable `j`:**
   - The loop variable `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `j` is not explicitly given, but we can infer that if the loop is about to execute again, `j` must be less than `c`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `c`.
   - Therefore, if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - The state of `l[1][1]` is given as `2 * (r + 2)`, and this remains unchanged for the next iteration.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the increment of `j` and the unchanged state of `l[1][1]`.

State: **`j` is `x + 1`, `l[1][1]` is `2 * (r + 2)`, all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.** 

However, since the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is not provided, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `l[1][1]` is `2 * (r + 2)`, all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.**
