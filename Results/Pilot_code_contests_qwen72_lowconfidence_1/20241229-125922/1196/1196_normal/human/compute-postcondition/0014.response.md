To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500, and either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- If `c` == 1, `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`.
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` with `l[0][0]` set to `r + 1` and all other elements set to 1.
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(c):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `c`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `r` remains the same.
- `c` remains the same.
- `flag` remains the same.
- `l` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- `j` is incremented by 1, making it 1.

### Final State:
State: **`r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500, and either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1; if `c` == 1, `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`; `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` with `l[0][0]` set to `r + 1` and all other elements set to 1; `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`; `i` is 0; `j` is 1**.
