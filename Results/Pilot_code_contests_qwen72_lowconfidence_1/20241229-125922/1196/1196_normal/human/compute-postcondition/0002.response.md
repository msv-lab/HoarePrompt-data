The code snippet `print(0)` prints the number 0 to the console. This operation does not affect the values of `r` and `c`. Since no changes are made to `r` and `c`, their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500, updated to the values provided by the user. The current values of `r` and `c` are both 1.**
