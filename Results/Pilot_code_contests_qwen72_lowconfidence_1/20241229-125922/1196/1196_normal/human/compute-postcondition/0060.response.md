The code `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` concatenates the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space to the string `s`. Here's the detailed impact:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
   - `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
   - Either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
   - If `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`.
   - `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`.
   - `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is an empty string.
   - `j` is 0.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - `s` is updated to `str(l[2][0]) + ' '`.
   - `l[2][0]` is calculated as `b[2] * b[r + 0]` which is `b[2] * b[r]`.

3. **Calculation:**
   - `b[2]` is the third element in the list `b`, which is 3 (since `b` contains elements from 1 to `r + c`).
   - `b[r]` is the `(r+1)`-th element in the list `b`, which is `r + 1`.

4. **Result:**
   - `l[2][0]` is `3 * (r + 1)`.
   - `s` becomes `str(3 * (r + 1)) + ' '`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, if `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `i` is 2, `s` is '3 * (r + 1) ', `j` is 0**
