The code `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` concatenates the string representation of the element `l[i][j]` followed by a space to the string `s`.

- `s` was initially `"b[0] * b[r] "`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `l[i][j]` corresponds to the element at the first row (index 0) and second column (index 1) of the 2D list `l`. According to the initial state, `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, which translates to `b[0] * b[r + 1]`.

Therefore, the new value of `s` will be `"b[0] * b[r] b[0] * b[r + 1] "`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, if `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `i` is 0, `s` is `"b[0] * b[r] b[0] * b[r + 1] "`, `j` is 1**
