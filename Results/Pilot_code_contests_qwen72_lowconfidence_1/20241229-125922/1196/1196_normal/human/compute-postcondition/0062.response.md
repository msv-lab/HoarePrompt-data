The code snippet `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space to the string `s`.

Given:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 1
- `s` is `'3 * (r + 1) '`

We need to determine the value of `l[2][1]` to update `s`.

From the initial state:
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c`.
- Each element `l[i][j]` is calculated as `b[i] * b[r + j]`.

To find `l[2][1]`:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 1
- `l[2][1]` is `b[2] * b[r + 1]`

Since `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, we can determine the values of `b[2]` and `b[r + 1]`:
- `b[2]` is the third element in `b`, which is 3.
- `b[r + 1]` is the `(r + 1)`-th element in `b`, which is `r + 1`.

Thus, `l[2][1]` is `3 * (r + 1)`.

Now, we append this value to `s`:
- `s` was initially `'3 * (r + 1) '`
- After appending, `s` becomes `'3 * (r + 1) 3 * (r + 1) '`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500
- Either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1
- If `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`
- `i` is 2
- `s` is `'3 * (r + 1) 3 * (r + 1) '`
- `j` is 1

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, if `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `i` is 2, `s` is `'3 * (r + 1) 3 * (r + 1) '`, `j` is 1**
