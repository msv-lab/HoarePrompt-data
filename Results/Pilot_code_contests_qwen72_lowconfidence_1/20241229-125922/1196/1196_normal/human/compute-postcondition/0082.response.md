The code `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` updates the variable `s` by appending the string representation of the element `l[i][j]` followed by a space. Given the initial state:

- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500
- `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1
- `flag` is `True`
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`
- `j` is 1
- `s` is an empty string
- `i` is `r - 1`
- `r` must be greater than 0

Let's calculate the new value of `s`:

1. `i` is `r - 1`
2. `j` is 1
3. `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`
   - `i` is `r - 1`
   - `j` is 1
   - So, `l[r-1][1]` is `b[r-1] * b[r + 1]`

Given that `b` contains elements from 1 to `r + c`:
- `b[r-1]` is `r`
- `b[r + 1]` is `r + 2`

Thus, `l[r-1][1]` is `r * (r + 2)`.

Therefore, the new value of `s` is the string representation of `r * (r + 2)` followed by a space.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 1, `s` is `str(r * (r + 2)) + ' '`, `i` is `r - 1`, `r` must be greater than 0**
