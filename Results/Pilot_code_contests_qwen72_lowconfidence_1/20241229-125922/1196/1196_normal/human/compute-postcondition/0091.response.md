To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500
- `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1
- `flag` is `True`
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`
- `j` is 2
- `s` is an empty string
- `i` is `r - 1`
- `s` has been printed (but now `s` is an empty string)

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(r):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `r` is greater than 0. Since `r` is given as an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, this condition is already satisfied.
2. **Loop Variable `i`**: The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `r - 1`. However, the initial state provided sets `i` to `r - 1`. This needs to be adjusted because the loop expects `i` to start from 0.

### Adjusted State:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500
- `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1
- `flag` is `True`
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`
- `j` is 2
- `s` is an empty string
- `i` is 0 (adjusted from `r - 1`)
- `s` has been printed (but now `s` is an empty string)

### Final State:
State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 2, `s` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `s` has been printed (but now `s` is an empty string)**
