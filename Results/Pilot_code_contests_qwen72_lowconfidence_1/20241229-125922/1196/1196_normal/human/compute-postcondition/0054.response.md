The code snippet provided appends the string representation of the element `l[i][j]` followed by a space to the string `s`. Let's break down the impacts and the resulting state:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `r`: An integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
   - `c`: An integer such that 2 < c ≤ 500.
   - `flag`: `True` if `c` == 1, otherwise `False`.
   - `l`: A 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
   - `b`: A list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
   - `i`: 1.
   - `s`: "2 * (r + 1) 2 * (r + 2)".
   - `j`: 2.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The element `l[i][j]` is accessed, which is `b[1] * b[r + 2]`.
   - The string `s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space.

3. **Calculations**:
   - `l[1][2]` = `b[1] * b[r + 2]`.
   - `b[1]` is 2 (since `b` contains elements from 1 to `r + c`).
   - `b[r + 2]` is `r + 2`.

   Therefore, `l[1][2]` = `2 * (r + 2)`.

4. **Updated String `s`**:
   - `s` was initially "2 * (r + 1) 2 * (r + 2)".
   - After appending, `s` becomes "2 * (r + 1) 2 * (r + 2) 2 * (r + 2) ".

5. **Output State**:
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 2 < c ≤ 500, `flag` is `False`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `i` is 1, `s` is "2 * (r + 1) 2 * (r + 2) 2 * (r + 2) ", `j` is 2**.
