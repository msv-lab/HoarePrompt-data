To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
- `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- `flag` is `True`.
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- `j` is 1.
- `s` is `str(r * (r + 2)) + ' ' + str(r + 1) + ' '`.
- `i` is 0.
- `r` must be greater than 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(r):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `r`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `r`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 0.
- `r` is greater than 0.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `r`.

### Updated State:
- `i` will be 1.
- `r` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 1, `s` is `str(r * (r + 2)) + ' ' + str(r + 1) + ' '`, `i` is 1, `r` must be greater than 1**
