The code snippet `b = [(i + 1) for i in range(r + c)]` creates a new list `b` where each element is the result of `i + 1` for `i` in the range from 0 to `r + c - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500, and either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- If `c` == 1, `flag` is `True`. Otherwise, `flag` remains `False`.
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` with all elements set to 1.

The new list `b` will contain `r + c` elements, starting from 1 up to `r + c`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500, and either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1. If `c` == 1, `flag` is `True`. Otherwise, `flag` remains `False`. `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` with all elements set to 1. `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.**
