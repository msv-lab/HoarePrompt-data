To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
- `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- `flag` is `True`.
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- `j` is 0.
- `s` is a string containing the concatenated string representations of `l[i][0]` for all `i` from 0 to `r-1`, separated by spaces.
- `i` is `r - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `c`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `c`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Increment `j` by 1.
- Ensure that `c` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Updated State:
- `r` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
- `c` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
- `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- `flag` remains `True`.
- `l` remains a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
- `b` remains a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- `j` is incremented to 1.
- `s` remains a string containing the concatenated string representations of `l[i][0]` for all `i` from 0 to `r-1`, separated by spaces.
- `i` remains `r - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 1, `s` is a string containing the concatenated string representations of `l[i][0]` for all `i` from 0 to `r-1`, separated by spaces, `i` is `r - 1`**
