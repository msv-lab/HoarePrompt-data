The code snippet `l[i][j] *= b[i] * b[r + j]` modifies the value of `l[i][j]` by multiplying it with `b[i] * b[r + j]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `j + 1`
- `l[1][1]` is `2 * (r + 2)`
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Let's analyze the impact:

1. **`j` is `j + 1`:**
   - This indicates that the current value of `j` is already incremented by 1.

2. **`l[1][1]` is `2 * (r + 2)`:**
   - This is a specific value for `l[1][1]`.

3. **Code Execution:**
   - The code `l[i][j] *= b[i] * b[r + j]` updates the value of `l[i][j]` by multiplying it with `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
   - Since `j` is `j + 1`, the effective value used in the calculation is `j + 1`.

4. **Impact on `l[i][j]`:**
   - The new value of `l[i][j]` is `l[i][j] * b[i] * b[r + (j + 1)]`.

5. **Specific Case for `l[1][1]`:**
   - If `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, then `l[1][1]` is updated to `2 * (r + 2) * b[1] * b[r + (1 + 1)]`.
   - Simplifying, `l[1][1]` becomes `2 * (r + 2) * b[1] * b[r + 2]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `j` is `j + 1`
- `l[1][1]` is `2 * (r + 2) * b[1] * b[r + 2]`
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `l[1][1]` is `2 * (r + 2) * b[1] * b[r + 2]`, all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.**
