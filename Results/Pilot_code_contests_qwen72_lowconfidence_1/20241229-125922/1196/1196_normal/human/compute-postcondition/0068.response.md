Postcondition: ***`r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500, and either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1. If `c` == 1, `flag` is `True`. Otherwise, `flag` remains `False`. `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`. `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`. Additionally, `flag` is `True`.***
