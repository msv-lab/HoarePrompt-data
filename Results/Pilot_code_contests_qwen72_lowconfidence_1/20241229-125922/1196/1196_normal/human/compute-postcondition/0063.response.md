To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
- Either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- If `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True`; otherwise, `flag` is `False`.
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`.
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is `'3 * (r + 1) 3 * (r + 1) '`.
- `j` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range of `0` to `c-1`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
- The new value of `j` should be 2.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `c`.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted by incrementing `j` by 1. The loop will execute one more time if `c` is greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, if `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `i` is 2, `s` is `'3 * (r + 1) 3 * (r + 1) '`, `j` is 2, `c` must be greater than 2**.
