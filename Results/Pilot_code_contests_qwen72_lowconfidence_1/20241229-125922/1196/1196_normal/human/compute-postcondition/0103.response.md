Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `r` and `c` from the user input, where both `r` and `c` are between 1 and 500 inclusive. If both `r` and `c` are 1, the function prints `0` and exits. Otherwise, it creates a 2D list `l` of size `r` x `c` and a 1D list `b` of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`. Each element `l[i][j]` in the 2D list is set to the product of `b[i]` and `b[r + j]`. If `c` is 1, the function transposes the matrix by swapping `r` and `c` and sets a flag to `True`. Finally, it prints the elements of the 2D list `l` in a specific format: if the flag is `False`, it prints `r` lines, each containing `c` space-separated values; if the flag is `True`, it prints `c` lines, each containing `r` space-separated values. The function does not return any value. **

Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If `r` or `c` is outside the range 1 to 500, the function's behavior is undefined.
- The function assumes valid input and does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values, values outside the specified range).
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where `r` or `c` is 0, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- The function does not return any value, and its primary effect is printing to the console.
