The code snippet concatenates the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space to the existing string `s`.

- `s` was initially set to `str(r * (r + 2)) + ' ' + str(r + 1) + ' '`.
- `l[i][j]` is calculated as `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
- `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, so `l[1][1]` is `b[1] * b[r + 1]`.

Given that `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, the value of `b[1]` is 1 and `b[r + 1]` is `r + 1`.

Thus, `l[1][1]` is `1 * (r + 1)` which is `r + 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `s` is `str(r * (r + 2)) + ' ' + str(r + 1) + ' ' + str(r + 1) + ' '`.

The updated state is:

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 1, `s` is `str(r * (r + 2)) + ' ' + str(r + 1) + ' ' + str(r + 1) + ' '`, `i` is 1, `r` must be greater than 1**
