The values of `r` and `c` are swapped. Initially, `c` is 1, and `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500 and `r` is not equal to 1. After swapping, `r` becomes 1, and `c` becomes the original value of `r`. The value of `flag` remains `True`.

Output State: **`r` is 1, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500 and `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`**
