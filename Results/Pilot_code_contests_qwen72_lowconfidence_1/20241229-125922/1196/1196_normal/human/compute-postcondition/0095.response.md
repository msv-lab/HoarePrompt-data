To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
- `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- `flag` is `True`.
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- `j` is 2.
- `s` is `"r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' '`.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` has been printed (but now `s` is `"r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' '`).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(r):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `r`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`r`, `c`, `flag`, `l`, `b`, `j`, `s`) do not change based on the loop condition alone.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `r`.

### Final State:
State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 2, `s` is `"r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' '`, `i` is 2, `s` has been printed (but now `s` is `"r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' '`)**
