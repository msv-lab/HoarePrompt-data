The code snippet concatenates the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space to the existing string `s`. Here's the detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
   - `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
   - `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
   - `flag` is `True`.
   - `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
   - `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `s` is `"r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' '`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` has been printed (but now `s` is `"r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' '`).

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `l[2][2]` followed by a space to the current value of `s`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `s` is updated to include the new string.

4. **Calculating `l[2][2]`**:
   - `l[i][j]` is `l[2][2]`.
   - According to the definition of `l`, `l[2][2] = b[2] * b[r + 2]`.
   - Since `b` contains elements from 1 to `r + c`, `b[2]` is 3 (because `b` is 1-indexed in terms of its values).
   - `b[r + 2]` is the value at index `r + 2` in the list `b`, which is `r + 2`.

5. **Resulting Value**:
   - `l[2][2] = 3 * (r + 2)`.

6. **Updating `s`**:
   - The original value of `s` is `"r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' '`.
   - The new value of `s` becomes `"r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' ' + str(3 * (r + 2)) + ' '`.

7. **Output State**:
   - `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
   - `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
   - `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
   - `flag` is `True`.
   - `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
   - `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `s` is `"r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' ' + str(3 * (r + 2)) + ' '`.
   - `i` is 2.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 2, `s` is `"r + 3 " + str(2 * (r + 2)) + ' ' + str(3 * (r + 2)) + ' '`, `i` is 2**.
