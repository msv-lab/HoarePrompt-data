To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
- `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- `flag` is `True`.
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- `j` is 1.
- `s` is a string containing the concatenation of `str(l[i][1])` for all `i` from 0 to `r - 1`, separated by spaces.
- `i` is `r - 1`.
- `s` has been printed.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `c`, meaning `j` will take values from 0 to `c - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2, and `j` must still be less than `c`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2.
- The condition `j < c` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 2, `s` is a string containing the concatenation of `str(l[i][1])` for all `i` from 0 to `r - 1`, separated by spaces, `i` is `r - 1`, and `s` has been printed.**
