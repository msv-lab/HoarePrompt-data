To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and the given state:

### Given State:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500
- `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1
- `flag` is `True`
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`
- `j` is 1
- `s` is an empty string
- `i` is `r - 1`

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(r):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for i in range(r):` will execute if `r` is greater than 0.
- The initial value of `i` is `r - 1`, but this is not relevant to the loop condition itself, as `i` will be reset to 0 when the loop starts.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `r` must be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`c`, `flag`, `l`, `b`, `j`, `s`, and `i`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

### Final State:
State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 1, `s` is an empty string, `i` is `r - 1`, `r` must be greater than 0**
