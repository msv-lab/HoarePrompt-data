To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State:
- `r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500, and either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- `flag` is `True`.
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`.
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for j in range(c):
    s = ''
    for i in range(r):
        s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
    print(s)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `c-1`.
   - For each `j`, the inner loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `r-1`.
   - Inside the inner loop, the string `s` is built by concatenating the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space.
   - After the inner loop completes, the string `s` is printed.

2. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `j` will have been incremented to `c` (since the loop runs from 0 to `c-1`).
   - The variable `i` will have been incremented to `r` within each iteration of the inner loop, but since `i` is reset to 0 at the start of each inner loop, its final value is not meaningful outside the loop context.
   - The string `s` will have been constructed and printed for each column `j` from 0 to `c-1`.
   - The 2D list `l` and the list `b` will remain unchanged.
   - The flag `flag` will still be `True`.

### Output State:
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500.
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500.
- Either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1.
- `flag` is `True`.
- `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`.
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- The loop will have printed `c` lines, where each line is a string containing the concatenated string representations of `l[i][j]` for all `i` from 0 to `r-1`, separated by spaces, for each `j` from 0 to `c-1`.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, and `c` lines have been printed, each containing the concatenated string representations of `l[i][j]` for all `i` from 0 to `r-1`, separated by spaces, for each `j` from 0 to `c-1`.**
