Output State: **`r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 500, either `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, if `c` == 1 then `flag` is `True` otherwise `flag` is `False`, `l` is a 2D list of size `r` x `c` where each element `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `r-1` and `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`, `i` is `r - 1`, `s` is a string containing the space-separated values of `l[r-1][j]` for `j` in the range 0 to `c-1`, `j` is `c - 1`, and the loop has printed `r` lines, each line containing `c` space-separated values corresponding to the elements of `l[i][j]` for the respective `i` in the range 0 to `r-1`.**
