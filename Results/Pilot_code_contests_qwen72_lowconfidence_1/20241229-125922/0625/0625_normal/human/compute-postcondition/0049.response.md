Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`, `torem` is a set, and `i` is 1. If `s[1]` is in `torem`, `c[s[1]]` is decreased by 1 and the rest of the current iteration in the loop is skipped. If `s[i] > ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]]` > 0, `ans` has one fewer element, and if the last element of `ans` was in `torem`, `c[ans[-1]]` is decreased by 1.***
