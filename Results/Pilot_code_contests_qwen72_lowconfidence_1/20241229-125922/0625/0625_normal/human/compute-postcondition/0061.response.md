The code `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the list `ans`. Given the initial conditions:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a list.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`.
- `torem` is a set.
- `i` is 1.
- If `ans` is not empty and `c[s[1]]` was greater than 0, `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1.
- If `c[s[1]]` was 1, `ans` contains `s[1]` and `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1.
- If `s[1]` is in `torem`, `c[s[1]]` is also decremented by 1.
- If `s[1]` is greater than `ans[-1]`, `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1.
- If `ans` is empty, no changes are made to `ans`, `c`, or `torem`.

The code `ans.append(s[i])` will append `s[1]` to `ans`. Since `i` is 1, the second character of `s` (i.e., `s[1]`) is added to `ans`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`, `torem` is a set, `i` is 1. If `ans` is not empty and `c[s[1]]` was greater than 0, `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1. If `c[s[1]]` was 1, `ans` contains `s[1]` and `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1. If `s[1]` is in `torem`, `c[s[1]]` is also decremented by 1. If `s[1]` is greater than `ans[-1]`, `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1.**
