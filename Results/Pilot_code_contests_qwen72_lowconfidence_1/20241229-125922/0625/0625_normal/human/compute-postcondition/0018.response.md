Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a non-empty list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`, `torem` is a set, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is in the set `torem`, `c[s[i]]` is 1, `s[i]` is greater than `ans[-1]`. If `c[ans[-1]]` > 0, `ans` has its last element removed, and `torem` does not contain `ans[-1]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
