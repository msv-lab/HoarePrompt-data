The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since this is a standalone `continue` statement without any surrounding loop context provided, it effectively means that the control flow would immediately look for the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.

However, since no loop structure is explicitly shown in the provided snippet, we assume that this `continue` statement is part of a larger loop structure that is not shown. The variables and their states remain unchanged except for the control flow which moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` with `c[s[i]]` decremented by 1, `torem` is an empty set, `i` is 0, and the character `s[i]` is in the set `torem`. We move to the next iteration of the loop.**
