The value of `n` is reassigned to be the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `n` was initially defined as a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)`, the reassignment does not change the value of `n`. The list `ans` remains empty.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `ans` is an empty list**
