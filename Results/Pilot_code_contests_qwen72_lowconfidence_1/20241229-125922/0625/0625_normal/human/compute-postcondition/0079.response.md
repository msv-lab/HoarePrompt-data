Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`. `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1). If `c[s[i]] == 1`, `ans` also contains `s[2]`, `c[s[2]]` is decremented by 1, and `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
