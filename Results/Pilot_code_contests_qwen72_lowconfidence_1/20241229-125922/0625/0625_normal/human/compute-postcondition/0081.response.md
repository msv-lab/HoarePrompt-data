The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop body and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. This means no further changes occur to the variables within the current iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` and `c[s[i]]` decremented by 1).
- If `c[s[i]] == 1`, `ans` also contains `s[2]`, `c[s[2]]` is decremented by 1, and `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`.

Since the `continue` statement is executed, the program skips any subsequent code in the loop body and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged from their state before the `continue` statement was encountered.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`. `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` and `c[s[i]]` decremented by 1). If `c[s[i]] == 1`, `ans` also contains `s[2]`, `c[s[2]]` is decremented by 1, and `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
