The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end immediately, and control passes to the next iteration of the loop. In this context, the `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables directly, but it affects the flow of execution within a loop.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1).
- `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `ans` is not empty and `c[s[1]]` was greater than 0, `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1.
- If `c[s[1]]` was 1, `ans` contains `s[1]` and `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1.
- If `s[1]` is in `torem`, `c[s[1]]` is also decremented by 1.
- If `s[1]` is greater than `ans[-1]`, `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1.

After executing `continue`:
- The loop will skip the remaining code in the current iteration and move to the next iteration.
- No changes are made to the variables `s`, `n`, `ans`, `c`, `torem`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1), `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`, `i` is 1. If `ans` is not empty and `c[s[1]]` was greater than 0, `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1. If `c[s[1]]` was 1, `ans` contains `s[1]` and `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1. If `s[1]` is in `torem`, `c[s[1]]` is also decremented by 1. If `s[1]` is greater than `ans[-1]`, `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1.**
