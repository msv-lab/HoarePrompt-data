The given code snippet removes the last element of the `ans` list from the `torem` set. Hereâ€™s the impact of this code on the program:

- The last element of the `ans` list is removed from the `torem` set.
- The values of `s`, `n`, `c`, `i`, and the elements of `ans` (except the last one) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a list.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`.
- `torem` is a set.
- `i` is 1.
- If `s[1]` is in `torem`, `c[s[1]]` is decreased by 1 and the rest of the current iteration in the loop is skipped.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `ans` is removed from the `torem` set.
- The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`, `torem` is a set without the last element of `ans`, `i` is 1, and if `s[1]` is in `torem`, `c[s[1]]` is decreased by 1 and the rest of the current iteration in the loop is skipped.**
