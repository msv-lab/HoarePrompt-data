The code snippet `ans.pop()` removes the last element from the list `ans`. This impacts the state of the list `ans` by reducing its length by one. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `c`, `torem`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a list.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`.
- `torem` is a set.
- `i` is 1.
- If the last element of `ans` is in `torem`, `c[ans[-1]]` is decreased by 1 and the rest of the current iteration in the loop is skipped.
- If `s[1]` is in `torem`, `c[s[1]]` is decreased by 1 and the rest of the current iteration in the loop is skipped.

After executing `ans.pop()`, the output state is:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a list with one fewer element (the last element has been removed).
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`.
- `torem` is a set.
- `i` is 1.
- If the last element of `ans` was in `torem`, `c[ans[-1]]` is decreased by 1 and the rest of the current iteration in the loop is skipped.
- If `s[1]` is in `torem`, `c[s[1]]` is decreased by 1 and the rest of the current iteration in the loop is skipped.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list with one fewer element, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`, `torem` is a set, `i` is 1, if the last element of `ans` was in `torem`, `c[ans[-1]]` is decreased by 1 and the rest of the current iteration in the loop is skipped, if `s[1]` is in `torem`, `c[s[1]]` is decreased by 1 and the rest of the current iteration in the loop is skipped.**
