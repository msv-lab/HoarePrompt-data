To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a list.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`.
- `torem` is a set.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Conditions:
1. If `s[i] < s[i + 1]`, then:
   - `c[s[i]]` is set to 0.
   - If `ans` was initially non-empty and `s[i]` is greater than `ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]] > 0`, `ans` has its last element removed, and `torem` does not contain `ans[-1]`.

2. If `s[i] >= s[i + 1]`, then:
   - `ans` contains `s[0]`.
   - `c[s[0]]` is decreased by 1.
   - `torem` contains `s[0]`.
   - If `c[s[0]]` was initially 1, `c[s[0]]` is now 0, and `s[0]` is in the set `torem`.
   - If `ans` is non-empty and `s[0]` is greater than `ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]] > 0`, `ans` has its last element removed, and `torem` does not contain `ans[-1]`.
   - If `c[s[0]]` is not 1, the state remains unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is at least 2, so `i` can be incremented to 1 and the loop can continue.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.
   - The loop condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Increment `i` from 0 to 1.
   - Ensure that `n` is still at least 2 (which it is, as `n` is at least 2).

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `s`, `ans`, `c`, and `torem` may change based on the conditions inside the loop, but these changes are not specified in the problem statement. We only need to ensure that `i` is correctly incremented and the loop condition is satisfied.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`, `torem` is a set, and `i` is 1.**
