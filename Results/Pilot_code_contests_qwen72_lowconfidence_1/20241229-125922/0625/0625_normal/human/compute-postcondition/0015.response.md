The code snippet removes the last element of `ans` from the set `torem`.

- `torem` initially contains the last element of `ans` (which is also `s[i]` since `s[i]` is in `torem` and `s[i]` is greater than `ans[-1]`).
- After executing the code, `ans[-1]` is removed from `torem`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a non-empty list.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`.
- `torem` is a set that no longer contains the last element of `ans` (`ans[-1]`).
- `i` is 0.
- The character `s[i]` is in the set `torem`.
- `c[s[i]]` is 1.
- `s[i]` is greater than the last element in `ans` (`ans[-1]`).
- The current value of `c[ans[-1]]` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a non-empty list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`, `torem` is a set that does not contain `ans[-1]`, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is in the set `torem`, `c[s[i]]` is 1, `s[i]` is greater than `ans[-1]`, `c[ans[-1]]` is greater than 0.**
