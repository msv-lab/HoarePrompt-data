The code snippet `ans.pop()` removes the last element from the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` contains the second character of the string `s` (`s[1]`). After executing `ans.pop()`, the list `ans` will be empty.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Specifically, `s` is still a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is still a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` is at least 2, `c` is still a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1), and if `ans[-1]` was in `torem`, `torem` is still an empty set and `i` is still 2.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1), if `ans[-1]` was in `torem`, then `torem` is an empty set and `i` is 2.**
