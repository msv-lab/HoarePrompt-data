The given code snippet is a function call `func_1(''.join(ans))`. This means that the list `ans` is joined into a single string and passed to the function `func_1`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `ans` is a list that contains characters from `s` in a lexicographically smallest subsequence.
- If `s[-1]` is not in the set `torem`, `s[-1]` is appended to `ans`.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with counts adjusted according to the operations performed in the loop).
- `torem` is a set containing characters that were marked for removal during the loop execution.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- If `n` is 0, `ans` remains an empty list, `c` remains the original counter object, and `torem` remains an empty set.

The function `func_1` is called with the string `''.join(ans)`, which is the lexicographically smallest subsequence formed from `s`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact behavior or output. However, the function call itself does not modify the variables in the initial state. The state of the variables remains unchanged except for the fact that the function `func_1` has been called with the joined string from `ans`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `ans` is a list that contains characters from `s` in a lexicographically smallest subsequence, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with counts adjusted according to the operations performed in the loop), `torem` is a set containing characters that were marked for removal during the loop execution, `i` is `n - 1`, `func_1(''.join(ans))` has been called.**
