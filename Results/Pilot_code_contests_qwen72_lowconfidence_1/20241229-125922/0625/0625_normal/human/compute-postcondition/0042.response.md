The code snippet `c[s[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the character at index `i` in the string `s` within the counter object `c`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 1, so the second character of the string `s` will have its count reduced by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` with `c[s[1]]` decreased by 1, `torem` is a set, and `i` is 1.**
