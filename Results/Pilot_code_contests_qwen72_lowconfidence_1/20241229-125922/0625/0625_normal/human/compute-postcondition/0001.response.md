The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `s` or `n`, which remain as specified in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `ans` with its value set to an empty list.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters (result of `func_17()`), `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `ans` is an empty list**
