Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1). If `s[i]` is in `torem`, `c[s[2]]` is decremented by 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`, and `i` is 2. If `ans` is not empty and `s[i]` > `ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]]` > 0, then `torem` is an empty set and `i` is 2. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged from the precondition.***
