The value of `c[s[i]]` is decremented by 1. Since `c[s[i]]` was initially 1, after this operation, `c[s[i]]` becomes 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[0]`, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` with `c[s[i]]` now 0, `torem` is a set, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is in the set `torem`, and `c[s[i]]` is 0. If `ans` was initially non-empty and `s[i]` is greater than `ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]]` > 0, `ans` has its last element removed, and `torem` does not contain `ans[-1]`.**
