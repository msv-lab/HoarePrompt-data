The code snippet `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the list `ans`.

- `ans` originally either contains `s[1]` (if `s[2]` was not added) or is an empty list (if `s[2]` was added). After appending `s[i]`, `ans` now contains `s[1]` and `s[i]` or just `s[i]`.
- `s` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `c` remains a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1 and possibly `c[s[2]]` decremented by 1).
- `torem` remains a set containing `s[1]`.
- The condition that `ans` is not empty and `s[i] > ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]] > 0` must still hold if applicable.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list that contains `s[1]` and `s[i]` (if `s[2]` was not added) or just `s[i]` (if `s[2]` was added), `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1 and possibly `c[s[2]]` decremented by 1), `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`. If `ans` is not empty and `s[i] > ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]] > 0`, the conditions regarding `ans`, `c`, and `torem` remain unchanged.**
