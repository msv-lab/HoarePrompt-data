The code snippet `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a list.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`.
- `torem` is a set.
- `i` is 0.
- If `c[s[i]]` == 1, `ans` contains `s[0]`, `c[s[i]]` is 0, and `s[i]` is in the set `torem`.
- Additionally, if `ans` is non-empty and `s[i]` is greater than `ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]]` > 0, `ans` has its last element removed, and `torem` does not contain `ans[-1]`.
- If `c[s[i]]` is not 1, the state remains unchanged.
- Moreover, `s[i]` is not less than `s[i + 1]`.
- If `ans` is non-empty and `s[i]` is greater than `ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]]` > 0, `ans` has its last element removed, and the current value of `c[ans[-1]]` is greater than 0. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

After executing `ans.append(s[i])`:

- `ans` now contains the first character of `s` (since `i` is 0).
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The other variables (`s`, `n`, `c`, `torem`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `c[s[i]]` == 1 and the conditions related to `ans` and `torem` remain as they were.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[0]`, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`, `torem` is a set, `i` is 0. If `c[s[i]]` == 1, `c[s[i]]` is 0, and `s[i]` is in the set `torem`. Additionally, if `ans` is non-empty and `s[i]` is greater than `ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]]` > 0, `ans` has its last element removed, and `torem` does not contain `ans[-1]`. If `c[s[i]]` is not 1, the state remains unchanged. Moreover, `s[i]` is not less than `s[i + 1]`. If `ans` is non-empty and `s[i]` is greater than `ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]]` > 0, `ans` has its last element removed, and the current value of `c[ans[-1]]` is greater than 0.**
