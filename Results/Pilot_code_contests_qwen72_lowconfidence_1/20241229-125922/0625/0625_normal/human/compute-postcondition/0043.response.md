The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not alter the values of the variables but affects the flow control within loops.

Given that the `continue` statement is encountered, the immediate effect is that any code following this statement in the loop body would not be executed for the current iteration. However, since no specific loop structure or subsequent code is provided, we can only note the impact on the control flow without altering the values of the variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` with `c[s[1]]` decreased by 1, `torem` is a set, and `i` is 1. The program skips the rest of the current iteration in the loop.**
