Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a non-empty list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`. `torem` is an empty set, and `i` is 0. The character `s[i]` is in the set `torem`, and `c[s[i]]` is decremented by 1. The current value of `c[s[i]]` is 1. Additionally, `s[i]` is greater than the last element in `ans` (`ans[-1]`).***
