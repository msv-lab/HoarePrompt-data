The code `ans.pop()` removes the last element from the list `ans`.

- `s` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is now a non-empty list, but its last element has been removed.
- `c` remains a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`.
- `torem` remains a set that does not contain `ans[-1]` (after the pop).
- `i` remains 0.
- `s[i]` remains in the set `torem`.
- `c[s[i]]` remains 1.
- `s[i]` remains greater than `ans[-1]` (after the pop).
- `c[ans[-1]]` remains greater than 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a non-empty list (with the last element removed), `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`, `torem` is a set that does not contain `ans[-1]`, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is in the set `torem`, `c[s[i]]` is 1, `s[i]` is greater than `ans[-1]`, `c[ans[-1]]` is greater than 0.**
