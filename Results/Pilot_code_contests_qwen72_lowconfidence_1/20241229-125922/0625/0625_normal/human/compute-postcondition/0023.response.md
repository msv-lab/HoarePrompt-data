The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables during this iteration, and the state of the program remains the same except for the control flow.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[0]`, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` with `c[s[i]]` now 0, `torem` is a set, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is in the set `torem`, and `c[s[i]]` is 0. If `ans` was initially non-empty and `s[i]` is greater than `ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]]` > 0, `ans` has its last element removed, and `torem` does not contain `ans[-1]`.**
