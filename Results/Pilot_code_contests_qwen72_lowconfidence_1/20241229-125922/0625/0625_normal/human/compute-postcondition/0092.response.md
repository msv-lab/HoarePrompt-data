Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `ans` is a list that contains characters from `s` in a lexicographically smallest subsequence, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with counts adjusted according to the operations performed in the loop), `torem` is a set containing characters that were marked for removal during the loop execution, and `i` is `n - 1`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), `ans` remains an empty list, `c` remains the original counter object, and `torem` remains an empty set. Additionally, the last character of `s` (`s[-1]`) is not in the set `torem`.**
