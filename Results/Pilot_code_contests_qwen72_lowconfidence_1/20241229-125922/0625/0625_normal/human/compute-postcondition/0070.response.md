The code `torem.remove(ans[-1])` removes the last element of `ans` from the set `torem`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1).
- If `s[i]` is in `torem`, `c[s[2]]` is decremented by 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
- `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`.
- `i` is 2.

The last element of `ans` is `s[1]`. This element is removed from the set `torem`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1).
- `torem` is an empty set.
- `i` is 2.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1), `torem` is an empty set, `i` is 2.**
