The code snippet `ans.pop()` removes the last element from the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1).
- If `c[s[i]] == 1`, `ans` also contains `s[2]`, `c[s[2]]` is decremented by 1, and `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`.

After executing `ans.pop()`, the last element of `ans` is removed. Since `ans` initially contains `s[1]` and possibly `s[2]`, the last element (which could be `s[2]` if it was added) is removed.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[1]` if `s[2]` was not added, or an empty list if `s[2]` was added, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1 and possibly `c[s[2]]` decremented by 1), `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`.**
