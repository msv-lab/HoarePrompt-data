Functionality: ** The function `func_29` processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and an integer `n` where `n = len(s)` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`. The function constructs a lexicographically smallest subsequence of `s` by iteratively removing characters that would prevent the subsequence from being the smallest possible. It maintains a counter `c` to track the frequency of each character in `s` and a set `torem` to mark characters for removal. After processing, the function appends the last character of `s` to the result if it has not been marked for removal. Finally, the function passes the constructed subsequence to `func_1` as a string. If `s` is empty, the function does nothing and `ans` remains an empty list. The function does not return any value. **

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Empty String**: If `s` is an empty string (`n = 0`), the function does not execute the loop and directly calls `func_1` with an empty string.
- **Single Character String**: If `s` contains only one character, the function appends that character to `ans` and calls `func_1` with a single-character string.
- **All Characters Unique**: If all characters in `s` are unique, the function will construct a subsequence that is the same as `s`.
- **All Characters Identical**: If all characters in `s` are the same, the function will construct a subsequence containing only one instance of that character.
- **Edge Case with Last Character**: The function ensures that the last character of `s` is included in the subsequence unless it has been marked for removal, which can happen if it is greater than the last character in `ans` and the last character in `ans` still has remaining occurrences in `s`.

### Final State:
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `ans` contains the lexicographically smallest subsequence of `s`.
- `c` is a counter object with adjusted counts based on the operations performed.
- `torem` contains characters that were marked for removal.
- The function calls `func_1` with the constructed subsequence as a string.
