The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there's no loop explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the implication is that this `continue` statement is part of a larger loop structure that is not detailed here. The `continue` statement itself does not alter the values of the variables directly.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1 and `c[s[2]]` decremented by 1), `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`, `i` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
