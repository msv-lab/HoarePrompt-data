Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[1]` if `s[2]` was not added, or an empty list if `s[2]` was added, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1 and possibly `c[s[2]]` decremented by 1), `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`. If `c[ans[-1]] > 0`, the conditions regarding `ans`, `c`, and `torem` remain unchanged.***
