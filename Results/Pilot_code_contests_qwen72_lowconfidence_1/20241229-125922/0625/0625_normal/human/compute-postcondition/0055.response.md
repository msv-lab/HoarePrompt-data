The code snippet `c[s[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the character at index `i` in the counter object `c` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a list.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`.
- `torem` is a set.
- `i` is 1.
- If `c[s[i]]` is 1, `ans` contains `s[1]` and `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1.
- If `s[1]` is in `torem`, `c[s[1]]` is also decremented by 1 and the rest of the current iteration in the loop is skipped.

Impact of the code:
- The count of the character `s[1]` in the counter object `c` is decremented by 1.

Output State:
**`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1, `torem` is a set, and `i` is 1.**
