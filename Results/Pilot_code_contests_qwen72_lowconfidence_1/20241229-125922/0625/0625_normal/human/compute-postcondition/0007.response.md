The code `c[s[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the character `s[i]` in the counter object `c` by 1. Given that `s[i]` is in the set `torem`, this means the count of `s[i]` in `c` is reduced by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` with `c[s[i]]` decremented by 1, `torem` is an empty set, `i` is 0, and the character `s[i]` is in the set `torem`.**
