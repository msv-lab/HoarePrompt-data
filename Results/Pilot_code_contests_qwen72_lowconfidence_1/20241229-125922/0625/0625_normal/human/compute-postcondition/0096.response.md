The function `func_29` accepts two parameters: `s` and `n`. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n` equals the length of `s` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`.

However, the provided code snippet does not show the parameters being passed to the function. Assuming the function is supposed to accept these parameters, the functionality of the function would be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and an integer `n`. The string `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters, and `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of `s` with the constraint that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`. The function's return value is not specified in the given output.**
