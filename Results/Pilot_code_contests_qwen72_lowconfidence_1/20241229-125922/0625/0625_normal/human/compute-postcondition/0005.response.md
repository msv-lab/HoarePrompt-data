To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `range(n - 1)` generates at least one value for `i`. This means `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 2.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)`.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`.
   - `torem` is an empty set.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 2.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and iterate up to `n - 2`.

### Final Adjusted State:

Given the initial state and the loop condition, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 2. The other variables remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop's execution directly.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`, `torem` is an empty set, `i` is 0**
