The code snippet `c[s[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the character at index `i` in the counter object `c` by 1.

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2.
   - `ans` is a list that contains `s[1]` and `s[i]` (if `s[2]` was not added) or just `s[i]` (if `s[2]` was added).
   - `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1 and possibly `c[s[2]]` decremented by 1).
   - `torem` is a set containing `s[1]` and `s[i]`.
   - The condition that `ans` is not empty and `s[i] > ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]] > 0` must still hold if applicable.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The count of the character at index `i` in the counter object `c` is decremented by 1.

3. **Updated State:**
   - The count of `s[i]` in `c` is now `c[s[i]] - 1`.

**Output State:**
**`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list that contains `s[1]` and `s[i]` (if `s[2]` was not added) or just `s[i]` (if `s[2]` was added), `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1, possibly `c[s[2]]` decremented by 1, and `c[s[i]]` decremented by 1), `torem` is a set containing `s[1]` and `s[i]`. If `ans` is not empty and `s[i] > ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]] > 0`, the conditions regarding `ans`, `c`, and `torem` remain unchanged.**
