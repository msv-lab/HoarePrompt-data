The value of `s` is now the result of the function call `func_17()`. Since the function `func_17()` is not defined in the given context, the exact value of `s` cannot be determined. However, the precondition states that `s` should be a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and this condition must remain valid after the function call. The value of `n` remains unchanged as `len(s)`, which is a non-negative integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters (result of `func_17()`), `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
