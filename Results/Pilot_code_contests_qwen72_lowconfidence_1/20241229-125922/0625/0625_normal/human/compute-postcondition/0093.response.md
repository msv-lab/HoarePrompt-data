The code `ans.append(s[-1])` appends the last character of the string `s` to the list `ans`.

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `ans` is a list that contains characters from `s` in a lexicographically smallest subsequence.
- `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with counts adjusted according to the operations performed in the loop).
- `torem` is a set containing characters that were marked for removal during the loop execution.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- The last character of `s` (`s[-1]`) is not in the set `torem`.

After executing the code, the last character of `s` is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `ans` is a list that contains characters from `s` in a lexicographically smallest subsequence with `s[-1]` appended to it, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with counts adjusted according to the operations performed in the loop), `torem` is a set containing characters that were marked for removal during the loop execution, `i` is `n - 1`, and the last character of `s` (`s[-1]`) is not in the set `torem`.**
