The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no actual computation or variable assignment is performed, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`, `c[s[1]]` is decremented by 1, `torem` is a set, and `i` is 1.**
