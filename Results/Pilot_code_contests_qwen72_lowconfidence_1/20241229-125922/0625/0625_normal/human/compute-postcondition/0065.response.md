Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[1]`, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` decremented by 1), `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`, `i` is 1. If `s[i] < s[i + 1]`, the rest of the loop body (if applicable) is skipped. If `s[i] >= s[i + 1]`, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and control passes to the next iteration. In both cases, no changes are made to the variables `s`, `n`, `ans`, `c`, `torem`, or `i` beyond the initial modifications.***
