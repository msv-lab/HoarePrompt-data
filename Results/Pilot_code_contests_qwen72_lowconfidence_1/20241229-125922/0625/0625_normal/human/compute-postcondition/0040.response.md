Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s`, `torem` is a set, and `i` is 0. If `s[i] < s[i + 1]`, `c[s[i]]` is set to 0, and if `ans` was initially non-empty and `s[i]` is greater than `ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]]` > 0, `ans` has its last element removed, and `torem` does not contain `ans[-1]`. If `s[i] >= s[i + 1]`, `ans` contains `s[0]`, `c[s[0]]` is decreased by 1, and `torem` contains `s[0]`. If `c[s[0]]` was initially 1, `c[s[0]]` is now 0, and `s[0]` is in the set `torem`. If `ans` is non-empty and `s[0]` is greater than `ans[-1]` and `c[ans[-1]]` > 0, `ans` has its last element removed, and `torem` does not contain `ans[-1]`. If `c[s[0]]` is not 1, the state remains unchanged.***
