The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration. It does not alter the values of the variables directly. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n = len(s)` and `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a list containing `s[1]` and `s[2]`, `c` is a counter object containing the count of each character in `s` (with `c[s[1]]` and `c[s[2]]` decremented by 1), `torem` is a set containing `s[1]`, `i` is 2, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
