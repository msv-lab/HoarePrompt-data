The function `func_5` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a set containing all divisors of `n`, including 1 and `n` itself. It correctly identifies all pairs of divisors `(start, n // start)` where `start` is a divisor of `n` and includes both elements of the pair in the result. The function handles the case where `n` is a perfect square by including the square root only once in the set. If `n` is 1, the function returns `{1}`.
