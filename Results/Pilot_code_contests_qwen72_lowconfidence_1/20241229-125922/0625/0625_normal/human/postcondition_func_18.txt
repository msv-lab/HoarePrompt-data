The function `func_18` accepts a parameter `var` of any type that can be converted to a string and writes the string representation of `var` to the standard output (stdout). The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the string representation of `var` will have been printed to the console, and the program state will remain unchanged except for the output produced. Edge cases include handling of non-string convertible types, which would result in a `TypeError` if `str(var)` fails.
