You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You are given a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. While there is at least one character in the string s that is repeated at least twice, you perform the following operation: 

  * you choose the index i (1 ≤ i ≤ |s|) such that the character at position i occurs at least two times in the string s, and delete the character at position i, that is, replace s with s_1 s_2 … s_{i-1} s_{i+1} s_{i+2} … s_n. 



For example, if s="codeforces", then you can apply the following sequence of operations: 

  * i=6 ⇒ s="codefrces"; 
  * i=1 ⇒ s="odefrces"; 
  * i=7 ⇒ s="odefrcs"; 



Given a given string s, find the lexicographically maximum string that can be obtained after applying a certain sequence of operations after which all characters in the string become unique.

A string a of length n is lexicographically less than a string b of length m, if: 

  * there is an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ min(n, m)) such that the first i-1 characters of the strings a and b are the same, and the i-th character of the string a is less than i-th character of string b; 
  * or the first min(n, m) characters in the strings a and b are the same and n < m. 



For example, the string a="aezakmi" is lexicographically less than the string b="aezus".

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Then t test cases follow.

Each test case is characterized by a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the strings in all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically maximum string that can be obtained after applying a certain sequence of operations after which all characters in the string become unique.
