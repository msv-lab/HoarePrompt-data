The function `func_7` accepts a list `ar` of elements that support accumulation operations (such as integers or floats) and returns a new list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements from the start of `ar` up to that position. For example, if `ar` is [1, 2, 3, 4], the returned list will be [1, 3, 6, 10]. The function assumes that the input list `ar` is non-empty and that its elements support the addition operation. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list.
