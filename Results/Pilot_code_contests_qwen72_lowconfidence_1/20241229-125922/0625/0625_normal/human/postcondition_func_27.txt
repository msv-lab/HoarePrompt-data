The function `func_27` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `p`, and `v`, where `n`, `m`, and `p` are non-negative integers, and `v` is a value of any type. It returns a nested list structure where there are `n` outer lists, each containing `m` middle lists, and each of those middle lists contains `p` instances of the value `v`. If any of the parameters `n`, `m`, or `p` are zero, the function will still return a valid nested list structure, but the corresponding levels of the list will be empty. For example, if `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list; if `m` is 0, it returns a list of `n` empty lists; and if `p` is 0, it returns a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` empty lists.
