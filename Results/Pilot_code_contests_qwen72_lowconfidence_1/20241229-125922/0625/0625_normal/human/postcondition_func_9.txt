The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value obtained from the function `func_17`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has an integer value returned by `func_17`. There are no side effects or modifications to any external variables or states. The function assumes that `func_17` always returns a value that can be safely converted to an integer. If `func_17` returns a non-integer value, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion.
