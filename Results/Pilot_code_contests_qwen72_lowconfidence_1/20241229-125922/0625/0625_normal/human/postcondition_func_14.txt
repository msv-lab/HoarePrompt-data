The function `func_14` accepts an integer `start` and returns an integer value. The returned value is the result of a series of bitwise operations and arithmetic calculations applied to the input `start`. Specifically, the function first applies a series of bitwise operations to transform `start`, and then uses the transformed value to compute the final result using another set of bitwise and arithmetic operations. The final result is an integer value that is the outcome of the expression `((start + (start >> 4) & 252645135) * 16843009 & 4294967295) >> 24`, where `start` is calculated as `(start_initial - (start_initial >> 1 & 1431655765)) & 858993459 + (start_initial - (start_initial >> 1 & 1431655765)) >> 2 & 858993459`. The function does not modify any external state and only returns the computed integer.
