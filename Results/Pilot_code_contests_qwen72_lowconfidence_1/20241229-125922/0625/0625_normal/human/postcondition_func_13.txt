The function `func_13` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls another function `func_1` with the argument `'No'`. The state of the program after the function `func_13` concludes is the same as before, except for any side effects that might be caused by the call to `func_1('No')`. Since the behavior and side effects of `func_1` are not provided, we cannot determine their impact on the program state. However, it is clear that `func_13` itself does not modify any input parameters or return any values.
