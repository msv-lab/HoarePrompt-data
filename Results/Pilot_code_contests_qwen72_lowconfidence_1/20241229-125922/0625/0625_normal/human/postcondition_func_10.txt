The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and does not have a specified return value. It calls another function `func_1` with the argument 'YES'. The state of the program after `func_10` completes is dependent on the behavior of `func_1`, which is not defined in the provided code. The function assumes the existence of a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, with a length between 1 and 2 â‹… 10^5, but it does not modify or interact with this string directly. The exact state of the program after `func_10` concludes depends on the side effects or return value of `func_1`.
