Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_29` does not correctly implement the logic required to generate the lexicographically maximum string with all unique characters. The problem description requires the function to repeatedly remove characters until all characters in the string are unique, and to do so in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the resulting string.

However, the logic in `func_29` is flawed. It attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest subsequence, which is the opposite of what the problem requires. Specifically, the function uses a set `torem` to mark characters for removal and a counter `c` to track character frequencies, but it does not correctly handle the removal of characters to ensure the resulting string is lexicographically maximum.

For example, consider the input string "abacaba". The correct output should be "cba", but the function `func_29` will likely produce a different result because it is designed to create the smallest subsequence, not the largest.

To fix this, the function would need to be rewritten to correctly identify and remove characters in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the resulting string.
