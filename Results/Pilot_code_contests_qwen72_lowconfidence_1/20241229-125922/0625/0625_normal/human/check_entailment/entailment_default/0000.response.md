Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_29` is intended to construct the lexicographically maximum subsequence of a string `s` where all characters are unique. However, the function as implemented does not correctly achieve this goal in all cases. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Characters**:
   - The function uses a set `torem` to mark characters for removal. However, the logic for adding and removing characters from `torem` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if ans and s[i] > ans[-1] and c[ans[-1]] > 0:` is used to decide whether to pop the last character from `ans`. This logic is not consistent with the requirement to construct the lexicographically maximum subsequence.
   - The function also incorrectly handles the case where a character should be added to `ans` but is not because it is marked for removal in `torem`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, consider the string `s = "abac"`. The correct lexicographically maximum subsequence with all unique characters is `"bac"`, but the function might not produce this result due to the flawed logic in handling characters and the set `torem`.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the string `s = "abac"`. The function should produce the subsequence `"bac"`. However, the function might produce `"abc"` instead, which is incorrect because it does not maximize the lexicographical order while ensuring all characters are unique.

4. **Algorithmic Flaw**:
   - The algorithm used in `func_29` is not optimal for constructing the lexicographically maximum subsequence. A correct approach would involve using a stack to keep track of the characters and ensuring that each character is added to the stack only if it does not violate the uniqueness constraint and maximizes the lexicographical order.

Given these issues, the function `func_29` does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
