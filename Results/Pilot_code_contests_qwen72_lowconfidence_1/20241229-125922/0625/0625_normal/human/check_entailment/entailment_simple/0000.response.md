Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to transform a given string into the lexicographically maximum string with all unique characters, as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key components and logic to see how it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func_17()` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing newline characters. This is used to read the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_3(t)` is responsible for processing `t` test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_29()` to process the string.

3. **Removing Duplicates and Building the Lexicographically Maximum String:**
   - In `func_29()`, the string `s` is read using `func_17()`.
   - A list `ans` is initialized to store the characters of the resulting string.
   - A counter `c` is created to keep track of the frequency of each character in `s`.
   - A set `torem` is used to mark characters that should be removed.

4. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates through each character in `s` except the last one.
   - If the current character is already marked for removal (`s[i] in torem`), it skips to the next iteration.
   - If the current character is unique (`c[s[i]] == 1`), it checks if it can be added to `ans` without violating the lexicographical order. If it can, it appends the character to `ans` and updates the counter.
   - If the current character is not unique, it checks if it can be added to `ans` or if it should be marked for removal based on the lexicographical order and the frequency of the last character in `ans`.

5. **Handling the Last Character:**
   - After the loop, the last character of `s` is checked. If it is not marked for removal, it is appended to `ans`.

6. **Output:**
   - The resulting string `ans` is joined into a single string and printed using `func_1()`.

The program correctly handles the following aspects of the problem:
- It ensures that all characters in the resulting string are unique.
- It builds the lexicographically maximum string by carefully managing the order and removal of characters.
- It processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

Given these points, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and is therefore correct.
