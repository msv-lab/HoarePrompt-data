You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. While there is at least one character in the string s that is repeated at least twice, you perform the following operation: 

  * you choose the index i (1 ≤ i ≤ |s|) such that the character at position i occurs at least two times in the string s, and delete the character at position i, that is, replace s with s_1 s_2 … s_{i-1} s_{i+1} s_{i+2} … s_n. 



For example, if s="codeforces", then you can apply the following sequence of operations: 

  * i=6 ⇒ s="codefrces"; 
  * i=1 ⇒ s="odefrces"; 
  * i=7 ⇒ s="odefrcs"; 



Given a given string s, find the lexicographically maximum string that can be obtained after applying a certain sequence of operations after which all characters in the string become unique.

A string a of length n is lexicographically less than a string b of length m, if: 

  * there is an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ min(n, m)) such that the first i-1 characters of the strings a and b are the same, and the i-th character of the string a is less than i-th character of string b; 
  * or the first min(n, m) characters in the strings a and b are the same and n < m. 



For example, the string a="aezakmi" is lexicographically less than the string b="aezus".

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Then t test cases follow.

Each test case is characterized by a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the strings in all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically maximum string that can be obtained after applying a certain sequence of operations after which all characters in the string become unique.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not always produce the lexicographically maximum string after removing duplicate characters. Specifically, the logic in `func_29` is flawed because it does not always ensure that the highest possible character is retained while removing duplicates. For instance, consider the string "cbacdcbc". The expected output should be "dcba", but the provided program might produce a different result.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The current logic in `func_29` tries to remove characters based on their immediate neighbors and the count of remaining occurrences, but it does not always ensure that the highest possible character is retained. This can lead to suboptimal results.

2. **Example Case**: For the input "cbacdcbc":
   - The program might incorrectly remove 'c' early on, leading to a suboptimal result like "dabc" instead of the correct "dcba".

To fix this, the program should use a greedy approach to build the result string by ensuring that the highest possible character is always considered first, while also ensuring that each character is included only once. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_29():
    s = func_17()
    ans = []
    n = len(s)
    c = counter(s)
    seen = set()
    for i in range(n):
        c[s[i]] -= 1
        if s[i] in seen:
            continue
        while ans and s[i] > ans[-1] and c[ans[-1]] > 0:
            seen.remove(ans.pop())
        ans.append(s[i])
        seen.add(s[i])
    func_1(''.join(ans))
```

This corrected logic ensures that the lexicographically maximum string is always produced by considering the highest possible character first and ensuring that each character is included only once.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
