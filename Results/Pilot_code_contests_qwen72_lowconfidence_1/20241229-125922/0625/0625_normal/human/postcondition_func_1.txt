The function `func_2` accepts a string `f` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and an optional list `stack` initialized as an empty list. However, the function does not perform any operations on these inputs and immediately returns a variable `wrapped_func`, which is not defined or modified within the function. As a result, the function's behavior is incomplete and the exact nature of `wrapped_func` remains unknown. After the function executes, the state of the program is unchanged except for the undefined `wrapped_func` being returned. This suggests that the function is either incomplete or intended to be part of a larger context where `wrapped_func` is defined elsewhere.
