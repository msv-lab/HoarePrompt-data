The function `func_28` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are integers and `b` is greater than 0. It returns the integer result of `(a + b - 1) // b`. This effectively computes the ceiling of the division of `a` by `b` when `a` and `b` are positive integers. For negative values of `a`, the result will be the largest integer less than or equal to `(a + b - 1) / b`. The function ensures that the returned value is always an integer.
