The function `func_3` accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. It then calls the function `func_29` exactly `t` times. After the function `func_3` completes its execution, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `func_29` has been called `t` times. No other changes are made to the program state.
