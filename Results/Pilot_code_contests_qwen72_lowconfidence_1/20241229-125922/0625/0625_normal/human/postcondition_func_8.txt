The function `func_8` accepts a non-empty list `ar` of elements that support the accumulation operation (e.g., integers, floats). It returns a new list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the current position to the end of the list `ar` in its original order. This means that for each index `i` in the returned list, the value at that index is the sum of all elements from index `i` to the end of the list `ar`. If the input list `ar` is empty or contains elements that do not support the accumulation operation, the behavior is undefined.
