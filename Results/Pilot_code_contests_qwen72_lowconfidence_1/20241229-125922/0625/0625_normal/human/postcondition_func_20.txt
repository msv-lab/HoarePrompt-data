The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.), and each substring is converted to a string (though this conversion is redundant since the substrings are already strings). The function returns a list of these substrings. If `func_17` returns an empty string, `func_20` will return an empty list. If `func_17` returns a string with multiple consecutive whitespace characters, `func_20` will return a list with empty strings for each group of consecutive whitespace characters. If `func_17` returns a string with leading or trailing whitespace, those will be included in the resulting list.
