The function `func_24` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_18` with the string `'\n'` as its argument. The return value of `func_24` is unspecified. After the function `func_24` concludes, the state of the program is dependent on the behavior of `func_18`. If `func_18` has side effects (such as printing to the console or modifying global variables), those side effects will be observable. However, if `func_18` does not have any side effects or return a value, the state of the program remains unchanged.
