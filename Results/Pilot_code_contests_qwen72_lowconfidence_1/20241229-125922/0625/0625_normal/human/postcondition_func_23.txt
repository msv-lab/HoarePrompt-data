The function `func_23` does not accept any parameters and returns an iterator of floats. Each float in the iterator is the result of converting a substring from the string returned by `func_17()` into a floating-point number. If `func_17()` returns a string that cannot be split into substrings (e.g., an empty string), the resulting iterator will be empty. If any substring from `func_17()` cannot be converted to a float (e.g., contains non-numeric characters), a `ValueError` will be raised when attempting to convert it.
