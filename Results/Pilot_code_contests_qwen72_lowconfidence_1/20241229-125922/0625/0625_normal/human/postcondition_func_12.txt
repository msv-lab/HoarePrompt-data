The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls another function `func_1` with the string 'Yes' as an argument. The state of the program after `func_12` concludes is dependent on the behavior of `func_1`. Since the implementation of `func_1` is not provided, the exact postconditions of `func_12` cannot be fully determined. However, it is clear that `func_12` does not modify any input variables or return any results directly. The primary action performed by `func_12` is invoking `func_1` with a fixed string 'Yes'.
