The function `func_4` takes three parameters `A`, `B`, and `p`, where `A` and `B` are non-negative integers, and `p` is a positive integer greater than 1. It returns the result of `A` raised to the power of `B`, modulo `p`. If `A` is 0 modulo `p`, the function immediately returns 0. Otherwise, it computes the modular exponentiation using an efficient algorithm that iterates through the bits of `B`. After the function completes, `A` is modified to be `A % p`, `B` is reduced to 0, and `p` remains unchanged. The final state of the program is such that the function returns the correct result of `A^B % p`, unless `A` is 0 modulo `p`, in which case it returns 0.
