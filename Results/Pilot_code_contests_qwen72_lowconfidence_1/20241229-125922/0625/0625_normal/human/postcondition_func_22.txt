The function `func_22` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on spaces. Each substring is converted to a string (though they are already strings, this step is redundant). The function returns a map object that iterates over these substrings, applying the `str` function to each. The final state of the program includes a map object that can be iterated over to access the substrings. If `func_17` returns an empty string, the map object will be empty. If `func_17` returns a string with no spaces, the map object will contain a single element, which is the entire string.
