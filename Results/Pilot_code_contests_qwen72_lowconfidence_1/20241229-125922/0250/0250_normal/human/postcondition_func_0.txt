The function reads two integers `N` and `M` from user input, followed by two lists of integers `S` and `T` of lengths `N` and `M` respectively. It then calculates the number of ways to match the elements of `S` with the elements of `T` using dynamic programming, with results taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Finally, it prints the result of this calculation plus one, also modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly. Edge cases include scenarios where `N` or `M` are zero, in which case the function will still initialize the `dp` array but the final printed value will be 1 (since `dp[0][0]` is 0 and adding 1 gives 1).
