To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\).
- `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive).
- `input` is a list of substrings from `source`.
- `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
- `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
- `MOD` is \(1000000007\).
- `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to match the first `i` elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\).
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `m`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `range(1, m + 1)` generates a sequence of values. This means `m` must be at least 1.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is already set to 2.
   - `j` is initially set to `m`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `m` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
- Ensure `i` is 2 (which is already given).
- Ensure `dp` is initialized as a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\).

### Final State:
State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to match the first `i` elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\), `i` is 2, and `j` is `m`**
