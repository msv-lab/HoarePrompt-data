The given code snippet updates the `dp` table using the formula:

```
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1]
```

Given the initial state:

- `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\)
- `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive)
- `input` is a list of substrings from `source`
- `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 3
- `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input
- `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input
- `MOD` is \(1000000007\)
- `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to match the first `i` elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\)
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 3
- `dp[3][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `m + 1` is equal to `dp[2][j] % MOD`
- If `s[3] == t[3]`, then `dp[3][3]` is updated to `dp[2][3] % MOD + dp[2][2] + 1` modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[3][3]` remains `dp[2][3] % MOD`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `dp[3][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `m + 1` is `dp[2][j] % MOD`
   - If `s[3] == t[3]`, then `dp[3][3]` is updated to `dp[2][3] % MOD + dp[2][2] + 1` modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[3][3]` remains `dp[2][3] % MOD`.

2. **Update `dp[3][3]`:**
   - Check if `s[3] == t[3]`
     - If true: `dp[3][3] = (dp[2][3] % MOD + dp[2][2] + 1) % MOD`
     - If false: `dp[3][3] = dp[2][3] % MOD`

3. **Apply the given formula:**
   - For `i = 3` and `j = 3`:
     - `dp[3][3] = dp[2][3] + dp[3][2] - dp[2][2]`

### Final Calculation:

- If `s[3] == t[3]`:
  - `dp[3][3] = (dp[2][3] % MOD + dp[2][2] + 1) % MOD`
  - `dp[3][3] = dp[2][3] + dp[3][2] - dp[2][2]`

- If `s[3] != t[3]`:
  - `dp[3][3] = dp[2][3] % MOD`
  - `dp[3][3] = dp[2][3] + dp[3][2] - dp[2][2]`

### Output State:

- `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\)
- `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive)
- `input` is a list of substrings from `source`
- `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 3
- `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input
- `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input
- `MOD` is \(1000000007\)
- `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\)
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 3
- `dp[3][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `m + 1` is `dp[2][j] % MOD`
- If `s[3] == t[3]`, then `dp[3][3]` is updated to `(dp[2][3] % MOD + dp[2][2] + 1) % MOD`
- Otherwise, `dp[3][3]` remains `dp[2][3] % MOD`
- `dp[3][3] = dp[2][3] + dp[3][2] - dp[2][2]`

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\), `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `dp[3][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `m + 1` is `dp[2][j] % MOD`, if `s[3] == t[3]`, then `dp[3][3]` is updated to `(dp[2][3] % MOD + dp[2][2] + 1) % MOD`, otherwise `dp[3][3]` remains `dp[2][3] % MOD`, `dp[3][3] = dp[2][3] + dp[3][2] - dp[2][2]`**
