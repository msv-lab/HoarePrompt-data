The code snippet `dp[i][j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by taking the remainder of its current value when divided by `MOD`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\)
- `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive)
- `input` is a list of substrings from `source`
- `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input
- `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input
- `MOD` is \(1000000007\)
- `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where each element is 0 except `dp[1][1]` which is 1 if `s[i]` equals `t[j]`, otherwise `dp[1][1]` remains 0
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1

The impact of the code on the program:
- The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i][j] % MOD`.

Since `i` and `j` are both 1, and `dp[1][1]` is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, otherwise it is 0, the value of `dp[1][1]` will be:
- If `s[1] == t[1]`, `dp[1][1]` is 1, and `1 % MOD` is 1.
- If `s[1] != t[1]`, `dp[1][1]` is 0, and `0 % MOD` is 0.

Therefore, the value of `dp[1][1]` remains unchanged after the operation.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where each element is 0 except `dp[1][1]` which is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, otherwise `dp[1][1]` remains 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1.**
