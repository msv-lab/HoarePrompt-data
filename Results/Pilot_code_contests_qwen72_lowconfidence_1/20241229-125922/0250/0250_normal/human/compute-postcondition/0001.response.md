The code snippet splits the string `source` using spaces as delimiters and assigns the resulting list to the variable `input`.

- `input` now contains a list of substrings from `source`.
- The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `T` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **N and M are integers such that 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2 × 10^3; S and T are lists of integers of lengths N and M, respectively, where each element in S and T is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive); `input` is a list of substrings from `source`.**
