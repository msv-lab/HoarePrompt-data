The given code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the values of its neighbors in the 2D list `dp`. Specifically, it sets `dp[i][j]` to the sum of the value above it (`dp[i - 1][j]`) and the value to its left (`dp[i][j - 1]`), subtracting the value diagonally above and to the left (`dp[i - 1][j - 1]`). 

Given the initial state:
- `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\)
- `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive)
- `input` is a list of substrings from `source`
- `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input
- `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input
- `MOD` is \(1000000007\)
- `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where each element is 0 except `dp[1][1]` which is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, otherwise `dp[1][1]` remains 0
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 2

The code snippet:
```python
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1]
```

Step-by-step impact:
1. `dp[i - 1][j]` is `dp[0][2]`, which is 0 (since `dp` is initialized to 0 except for `dp[1][1]`).
2. `dp[i][j - 1]` is `dp[1][1]`, which is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, otherwise it is 0.
3. `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` is `dp[0][1]`, which is 0 (since `dp` is initialized to 0 except for `dp[1][1]`).

Thus, the new value of `dp[i][j]` (which is `dp[1][2]`) is:
- If `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, then `dp[1][2] = 0 + 1 - 0 = 1`.
- Otherwise, `dp[1][2] = 0 + 0 - 0 = 0`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where each element is 0 except `dp[1][1]` which is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, otherwise `dp[1][1]` remains 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `dp[1][2]` is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, otherwise `dp[1][2]` is 0.**
