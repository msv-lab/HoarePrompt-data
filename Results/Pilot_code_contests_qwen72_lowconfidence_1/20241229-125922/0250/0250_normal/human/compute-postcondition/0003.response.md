The code snippet reads a space-separated string of integers from the user input, converts each part into an integer, and constructs a list `s` that starts with 0 followed by these integers. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` and `M` are integers such that 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2 × 10^3.
- `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths N and M, respectively, where each element in S and T is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `input` is a list of substrings from `source`.
- `n` is equal to `int(input[0])`.
- `m` is equal to `int(input[1])`.

The new list `s` is constructed by adding 0 at the beginning and then appending the integers read from the user input.

Output State: **N and M are integers such that 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2 × 10^3; S and T are lists of integers of lengths N and M, respectively, where each element in S and T is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive); `input` is a list of substrings from `source`; `n` is equal to `int(input[0])`; `m` is equal to `int(input[1])`; `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.**
