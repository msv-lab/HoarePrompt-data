Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program step by step:

### Initial State:
- `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\).
- `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive).
- `input` is a list of substrings from `source`.
- `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
- `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
- `MOD` is \(1000000007\).
- `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where each element is 0 except `dp[1][1]` which is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, otherwise `dp[1][1]` remains 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `dp[1][2]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]`, otherwise `dp[1][2]` is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]`.
- `dp[1][3]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]`, otherwise `dp[1][3]` is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]`.

### Code Snippet:
```
dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
```

### Analysis:
- The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1` to it.
- Given `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, the code will update `dp[1][3]` using the value of `dp[0][2] + 1`.

### Calculation:
- `dp[0][2]` is 0 because `dp` is initialized with 0s except for specific conditions.
- Therefore, `dp[1][3]` will be updated to `0 + 1` plus its current value.

### Current Value of `dp[1][3]`:
- According to the initial state, `dp[1][3]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]`, otherwise it is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]`.

### Updated Value of `dp[1][3]`:
- If `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]`, then `dp[1][3]` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.
- If `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]`, then `dp[1][3]` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

### Output State:
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where each element is 0 except `dp[1][1]` which is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, otherwise `dp[1][1]` remains 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `dp[1][2]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]`, otherwise `dp[1][2]` is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]`, `dp[1][3]` is 3 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]`, otherwise `dp[1][3]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]**.**
