The given code snippet applies the modulo operation to the value at `dp[i][j]`. Given the initial state, let's determine the specific value of `dp[i][j]` before the operation and its new value after the operation.

- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `dp[1][3]` is 3 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, `s[1]` equals `t[2]`, and `s[1]` equals `t[3]`.
- Otherwise, `dp[1][3]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]` or `t[3]`.

Applying the modulo operation (`% MOD`) to `dp[1][3]`:

- If `dp[1][3]` is 3, then `dp[1][3] % MOD` results in 3, since 3 is less than `MOD` (\(1000000007\)).
- If `dp[1][3]` is 2, then `dp[1][3] % MOD` results in 2, since 2 is less than `MOD` (\(1000000007\)).

Therefore, the value of `dp[1][3]` remains the same after the modulo operation.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where each element is 0 except `dp[1][1]` which is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, otherwise `dp[1][1]` remains 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `dp[1][2]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]`, otherwise `dp[1][2]` is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]`, `dp[1][3]` is 3 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]` and `s[1]` equals `t[3]`, otherwise `dp[1][3]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]` or `t[3]**.
