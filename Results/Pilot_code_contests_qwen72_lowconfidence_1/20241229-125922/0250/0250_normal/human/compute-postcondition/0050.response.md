To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\).
   - `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive).
   - `input` is a list of substrings from `source`.
   - `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
   - `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
   - `MOD` is \(1000000007\).
   - `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to match the first `i` elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\).
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` starts at 1.
   - `dp[3][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `m + 1` is equal to `dp[2][j] % MOD`.
   - If `s[i]` is equal to `t[j]`, then `dp[3][j]` is updated to `(dp[2][j] + dp[2][j - 1] + 1) % MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[3][j]` remains equal to `dp[2][j] % MOD`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(1, m + 1):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m`.
   - At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1.
- `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to match the first `i` elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\), `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `dp[3][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `m + 1` is equal to `dp[2][j] % MOD`. If `s[i]` is equal to `t[j]`, then `dp[3][j]` is updated to `(dp[2][j] + dp[2][j - 1] + 1) % MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[3][j]` remains equal to `dp[2][j] % MOD`.**
