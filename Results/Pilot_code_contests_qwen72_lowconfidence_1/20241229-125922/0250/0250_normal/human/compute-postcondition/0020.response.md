The given code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` using the formula `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1]`. Given the initial state, we can determine the new value of `dp[1][3]` as follows:

- `i` is 1
- `j` is 3
- `dp[1][3]` is updated using the values of `dp[0][3]`, `dp[1][2]`, and `dp[0][2]`.

From the initial state:
- `dp[0][3]` is 0 (since all elements in `dp` are 0 except `dp[1][1]` and possibly `dp[1][2]`).
- `dp[1][2]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]`, otherwise it is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]`.
- `dp[0][2]` is 0 (since all elements in the first row of `dp` are 0 except `dp[0][0]`).

Thus, the calculation for `dp[1][3]` is:
- `dp[1][3] = dp[0][3] + dp[1][2] - dp[0][2]`
- `dp[1][3] = 0 + dp[1][2] - 0`
- `dp[1][3] = dp[1][2]`

Since `dp[1][2]` is either 2 or 1 depending on the values of `s[1]` and `t[1]` and `t[2]`, `dp[1][3]` will also be 2 or 1 respectively.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where each element is 0 except `dp[1][1]` which is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, otherwise `dp[1][1]` remains 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `dp[1][2]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]`, otherwise `dp[1][2]` is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]`, `dp[1][3]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]`, otherwise `dp[1][3]` is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]`**.
