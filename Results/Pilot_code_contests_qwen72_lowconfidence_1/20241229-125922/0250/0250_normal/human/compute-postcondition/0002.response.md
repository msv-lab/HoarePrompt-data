The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `input` to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer, and the second element of the list `input` to the variable `m` after converting it to an integer. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `T` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **N and M are integers such that 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2 × 10^3; S and T are lists of integers of lengths N and M, respectively, where each element in S and T is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive); `input` is a list of substrings from `source`; `n` is equal to `int(input[0])`; `m` is equal to `int(input[1])`.**
