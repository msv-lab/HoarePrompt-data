The provided Python code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` using the formula `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1]`. Here's the detailed impact on the program:

- The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i - 1][j]`, `dp[i][j - 1]`, and `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`.
- The variables `i` and `j` are used in the calculation and are specified as `i = 2` and `j = m`.
- The values of `dp[i - 1][j]`, `dp[i][j - 1]`, and `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` are assumed to be already computed and stored in the `dp` array.

Let's calculate the new value of `dp[2][m]`:
- `dp[2][m] = dp[1][m] + dp[2][m - 1] - dp[1][m - 1]`

The output state reflects this update while keeping all other initial conditions unchanged.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to match the first `i` elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\), `i` is 2, `j` is `m`, `dp[2][m] = dp[1][m] + dp[2][m - 1] - dp[1][m - 1]`**
