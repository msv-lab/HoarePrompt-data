To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Variables and Initial Conditions:**
   - `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\).
   - `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive).
   - `input` is a list of substrings from `source`.
   - `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `m` is equal to `int(input[1])`.
   - `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
   - `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
   - `MOD` is \(1000000007\).
   - `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where each element is 0.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m + 1`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1.
   - The variable `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `m + 1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Ensure `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - Initialize `j` to 1.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `m` is at least 1 and `j` starts at 1.

State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where each element is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
