Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to match the first `i` elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\), `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `dp[2][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `m + 1` is computed as follows:**

- **For each `j` from 1 to `m + 1`:**
  - **`dp[2][j]` is initially set to `(dp[1][j] + dp[2][j - 1] - dp[1][j - 1]) % MOD`.**
  - **If `s[2] == t[j]`, then `dp[2][j]` is incremented by `dp[1][j - 1] + 1` and taken modulo \(1000000007\).**
  - **Thus, `dp[2][j]` is the number of ways to match the first 2 elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\).**

**All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.**
