Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where each element is 0 except `dp[1][1]` which is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]`, otherwise `dp[1][1]` remains 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `dp[1][2]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]`, otherwise `dp[1][2]` is 1 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]`, `dp[1][3]` is 3 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and `s[1]` equals `t[2]` and `s[1]` equals `t[3]`, otherwise `dp[1][3]` is 2 if `s[1]` equals `t[1]` and does not equal `t[2]` or `t[3]`***.
