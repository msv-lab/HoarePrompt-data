The given code snippet is:

```python
dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
```

### Initial State:
- `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\).
- `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive).
- `input` is a list of substrings from `source`.
- `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
- `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
- `MOD` is \(1000000007\).
- `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to match the first `i` elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\).
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `m + 1`.
- `dp[2][m + 1]` is \((dp[1][m + 1] + dp[2][m] - dp[1][m]) \mod MOD\).

### Impact of the Code:
- The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1` to its current value.
- Since `i` is 2 and `j` is `m + 1`, the specific indices involved are `dp[2][m + 1]`, `dp[1][m]`, and `dp[1][m + 1]`.

### Calculation:
- The current value of `dp[2][m + 1]` is \((dp[1][m + 1] + dp[2][m] - dp[1][m]) \mod MOD\).
- The new value of `dp[2][m + 1]` is:
  \[
  dp[2][m + 1] = (dp[1][m + 1] + dp[2][m] - dp[1][m]) \mod MOD + dp[1][m] + 1
  \]

### Output State:
**`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to match the first `i` elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\), `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `dp[2][m + 1]` is \((dp[1][m + 1] + dp[2][m] - dp[1][m]) \mod MOD + dp[1][m] + 1 \mod MOD\)**.
