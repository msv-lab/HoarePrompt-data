The provided code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` using the formula `dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state after executing this code.

### Initial State Recap:
- `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\).
- `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive).
- `input` is a list of substrings from `source`.
- `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
- `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
- `MOD` is \(1000000007\).
- `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\).
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 3.
- `dp[3][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `m + 1` is `dp[2][j] % MOD`.
- If `s[3] == t[3]`, then `dp[3][3]` is updated to `(dp[2][3] % MOD + dp[2][2] + 1) % MOD`, otherwise `dp[3][3]` remains `dp[2][3] % MOD`.
- `dp[3][3] = dp[2][3] + dp[3][2] - dp[2][2]`.

### Code Execution:
The code snippet:
```python
dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
```

### Impact:
- The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`.
- Since `i` is 3 and `j` is 3, the specific update is `dp[3][3] += dp[2][2] + 1`.

### Calculation:
- Before the update, `dp[3][3]` is already set to `dp[2][3] + dp[3][2] - dp[2][2]`.
- After the update, `dp[3][3]` becomes:
  \[
  dp[3][3] = (dp[2][3] + dp[3][2] - dp[2][2]) + dp[2][2] + 1
  \]
  Simplifying this:
  \[
  dp[3][3] = dp[2][3] + dp[3][2] + 1
  \]

### Output State:
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `dp[3][3]` is now `dp[2][3] + dp[3][2] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\), `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `dp[3][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `m + 1` is `dp[2][j] % MOD`, if `s[3] == t[3]`, then `dp[3][3]` is updated to `(dp[2][3] % MOD + dp[2][2] + 1) % MOD`, otherwise `dp[3][3]` remains `dp[2][3] % MOD`, `dp[3][3]` is now `dp[2][3] + dp[3][2] + 1`.**
