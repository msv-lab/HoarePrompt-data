The code snippet provided constructs the list `t` by starting with `[0]` and appending the integers from the space-separated string input obtained from `raw_input().split(' ')`. Each integer is converted to an int type before being added to the list.

- `t` is now a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.
- The lengths and ranges of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `T` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
- The values of `input`, `n`, `m`, and `s` also remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **N and M are integers such that 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2 × 10^3; S and T are lists of integers of lengths N and M, respectively, where each element in S and T is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive); `input` is a list of substrings from `source`; `n` is equal to `int(input[0])`; `m` is equal to `int(input[1])`; `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input; `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input.**
