Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's determine the output state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\)
- `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive)
- `input` is a list of substrings from `source`
- `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 3
- `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input
- `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input
- `MOD` is \(1000000007\)
- `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to match the first `i` elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\)
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 2
- `dp[3][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `m + 1` is equal to `dp[2][j] % MOD`
- If `s[i]` is equal to `t[j]`, then `dp[3][j]` is updated to `(dp[2][j] + dp[2][j - 1] + 1) % MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[3][j]` remains equal to `dp[2][j] % MOD`

### Code Snippet:
```python
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1]
```

### Step-by-Step Impact Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i = 3`
   - `j = 2`
   - `dp[3][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `m + 1` is equal to `dp[2][j] % MOD`
   - `dp[3][2]` is initially set to `dp[2][2] % MOD`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code updates `dp[3][2]` using the formula:
     ```python
     dp[3][2] = dp[2][2] + dp[3][1] - dp[2][1]
     ```
   - We need to determine the values of `dp[2][2]`, `dp[3][1]`, and `dp[2][1]`:
     - `dp[2][2]` is already known.
     - `dp[3][1]` is initially set to `dp[2][1] % MOD`.
     - `dp[2][1]` is already known.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Let's assume the values of `dp[2][2]`, `dp[2][1]`, and `dp[3][1]` are known:
     - Suppose `dp[2][2] = a`
     - Suppose `dp[2][1] = b`
     - Suppose `dp[3][1] = b % MOD` (since `dp[3][1]` is initially set to `dp[2][1] % MOD`)
   - The new value of `dp[3][2]` is:
     ```python
     dp[3][2] = (a + (b % MOD) - b) % MOD
     ```
   - Simplifying the expression:
     ```python
     dp[3][2] = (a + b % MOD - b) % MOD
     ```
   - Since `b % MOD` is just `b` if `b < MOD`, the expression simplifies to:
     ```python
     dp[3][2] = (a + b - b) % MOD
     dp[3][2] = a % MOD
     ```

### Output State:
- `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\)
- `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive)
- `input` is a list of substrings from `source`
- `n` is equal to `int(input[0])` and must be greater than or equal to 3
- `m` is equal to `int(input[1])` and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input
- `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input
- `MOD` is \(1000000007\)
- `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to match the first `i` elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\)
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 2
- `dp[3][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `m + 1` is equal to `dp[2][j] % MOD`
- `dp[3][2]` is updated to `dp[2][2] % MOD`
