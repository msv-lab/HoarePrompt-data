The code snippet initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(n + 1) x (m + 1)`, where each element is initialized to 0.

- `dp` is now a list of lists, where each inner list has `m + 1` elements, and there are `n + 1` such inner lists.
- Each element in `dp` is initially set to 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: **N and M are integers such that 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2 × 10^3; S and T are lists of integers of lengths N and M, respectively, where each element in S and T is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive); `input` is a list of substrings from `source`; `n` is equal to `int(input[0])`; `m` is equal to `int(input[1])`; `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input; `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (m + 1)` where each element is 0.**
