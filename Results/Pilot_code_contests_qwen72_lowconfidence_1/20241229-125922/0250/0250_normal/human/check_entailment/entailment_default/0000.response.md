Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully adhere to the problem description, particularly in the way it handles the initialization and computation of the dynamic programming (DP) table. Here are the key issues:

1. **Initialization of DP Table**: The DP table `dp` is initialized with zeros. However, the base case for the DP table is not properly handled. Specifically, the DP table should be initialized such that `dp[0][0] = 1`, because there is exactly one way to match the empty subsequence of `S` with the empty subsequence of `T`.

2. **Final Result Calculation**: The final result is calculated as `(dp[n][m] + 1) % MOD`. This is incorrect because the DP table already accounts for the number of valid subsequences, and adding 1 to the final result is unnecessary and incorrect.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where `N` or `M` are zero. In such cases, the number of valid subsequences should be 1 (the empty subsequence), but the current implementation will not produce the correct result.

### Corrected Code
Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses the issues mentioned:

```python
def func():
    source = raw_input()
    input = source.split(' ')
    (n, m) = (int(input[0]), int(input[1]))
    s = [0] + [int(i) for i in raw_input().split(' ')]
    t = [0] + [int(i) for i in raw_input().split(' ')]
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Initialize the base case
    dp[0][0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 1  # There is one way to match an empty subsequence of T with any subsequence of S
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            dp[0][j] = 1  # There is one way to match an empty subsequence of S with any subsequence of T
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            dp[i][j] %= MOD
    
    print(dp[n][m])

```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code
1. **Base Case Initialization**: `dp[0][0] = 1` initializes the base case where both `S` and `T` are empty.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: `dp[i][0] = 1` and `dp[0][j] = 1` ensure that there is one way to match an empty subsequence of one sequence with any subsequence of the other sequence.
3. **Final Result**: The final result is simply `dp[n][m]`, which correctly represents the number of valid subsequences.

By addressing these issues, the corrected code will now produce the correct output for all potential cases, including edge cases.
