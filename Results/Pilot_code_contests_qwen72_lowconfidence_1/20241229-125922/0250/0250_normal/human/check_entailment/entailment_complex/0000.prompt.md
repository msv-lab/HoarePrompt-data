You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two integer sequences S and T of length N and M, respectively, both consisting of integers between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).

In how many pairs of a subsequence of S and a subsequence of T do the two subsequences are the same in content?

Here the subsequence of A is a sequence obtained by removing zero or more elements from A and concatenating the remaining elements without changing the order.

For both S and T, we distinguish two subsequences if the sets of the indices of the removed elements are different, even if the subsequences are the same in content.

Since the answer can be tremendous, print the number modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3
* The length of S is N.
* The length of T is M.
* 1 \leq S_i, T_i \leq 10^5
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
S_1 S_2 ... S_{N-1} S_{N}
T_1 T_2 ... T_{M-1} T_{M}


Output

Print the number of pairs of a subsequence of S and a subsequence of T such that the subsequences are the same in content, modulo 10^9+7.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and M are integers such that 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2 × 10^3; S and T are lists of integers of lengths N and M, respectively, where each element in S and T is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
def func():
    source = raw_input()
    input = source.split(' ')
    n, m = int(input[0]), int(input[1])
    s = [0] + [int(i) for i in raw_input().split(' ')]
    t = [0] + [int(i) for i in raw_input().split(' ')]
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [([0] * (m + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            dp[i][j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` and `M` are integers such that \(1 \leq N, M \leq 2 \times 10^3\), `S` and `T` are lists of integers of lengths `N` and `M`, respectively, where each element is between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive), `input` is a list of substrings from `source`, `n` is equal to `int(input[0])`, `m` is equal to `int(input[1])`, `s` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `t` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the user input, `MOD` is \(1000000007\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (m + 1)\) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to match the first `i` elements of `s` with the first `j` elements of `t` modulo \(1000000007\). If `n` or `m` is 0, `dp` remains a 2D list of zeros.
    print((dp[n][m] + 1) % MOD)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `N` and `M` from user input, followed by two lists of integers `S` and `T` of lengths `N` and `M` respectively. It then calculates the number of ways to match the elements of `S` with the elements of `T` using dynamic programming, with results taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Finally, it prints the result of this calculation plus one, also modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly. Edge cases include scenarios where `N` or `M` are zero, in which case the function will still initialize the `dp` array but the final printed value will be 1 (since `dp[0][0]` is 0 and adding 1 gives 1).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
