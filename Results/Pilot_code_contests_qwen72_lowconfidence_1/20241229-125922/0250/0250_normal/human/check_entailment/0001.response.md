Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the base case correctly. The dynamic programming table `dp` is initialized with zeros, but the initial condition for empty subsequences should be set to 1 because an empty subsequence can always match another empty subsequence. This means that `dp[0][0]` should be initialized to 1, and the first row and first column of the `dp` table should be filled with 1s, as they represent the number of ways to form a subsequence from an empty sequence.

Additionally, the final result is printed as `(dp[n][m] + 1) % MOD`, which is incorrect. The `+1` is unnecessary because the DP table already accounts for all possible subsequences, including the empty subsequence.

A corrected version of the program would initialize the DP table correctly and remove the `+1` in the final result:

```python
def func():
    source = raw_input()
    input = source.split(' ')
    (n, m) = (int(input[0]), int(input[1]))
    s = [0] + [int(i) for i in raw_input().split(' ')]
    t = [0] + [int(i) for i in raw_input().split(' ')]
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Initialize the first row and first column
    for i in range(n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    for j in range(m + 1):
        dp[0][j] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            dp[i][j] %= MOD
    print(dp[n][m] % MOD)
```

This correction ensures that the program handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for all inputs.
