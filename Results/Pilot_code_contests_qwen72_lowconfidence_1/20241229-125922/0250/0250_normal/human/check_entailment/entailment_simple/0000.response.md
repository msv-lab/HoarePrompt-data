Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect DP Initialization and Base Case Handling:**
   - The dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` is initialized correctly, but the base cases are not handled properly. Specifically, `dp[0][0]` should be initialized to 1 because there is exactly one way to match the empty subsequence of `S` with the empty subsequence of `T`.

2. **Incorrect Final Result Calculation:**
   - The final result is printed as `(dp[n][m] + 1) % MOD`. However, this is incorrect. The correct final result should be `dp[n][m]` because `dp[n][m]` already represents the number of ways to match the subsequences of `S` and `T` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Handling of Subsequences:**
   - The DP transition logic is almost correct, but it needs to handle the base cases and the initialization of the DP table more carefully. Specifically, `dp[0][j]` and `dp[i][0]` should be initialized to 1 for all `i` and `j` because there is exactly one way to match an empty subsequence with any subsequence (by removing all elements).

### Corrected Version of the Program:

```python
def func():
    source = raw_input()
    input = source.split(' ')
    n, m = int(input[0]), int(input[1])
    s = [0] + [int(i) for i in raw_input().split(' ')]
    t = [0] + [int(i) for i in raw_input().split(' ')]
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    
    # Initialize the DP table
    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base cases: dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] should be 1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    for j in range(m + 1):
        dp[0][j] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            dp[i][j] %= MOD
    
    print(dp[n][m])

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0][j] = 1` for all `j` because there is exactly one way to match an empty subsequence of `S` with any subsequence of `T` (by removing all elements of `T`).
   - `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i` because there is exactly one way to match any subsequence of `S` with an empty subsequence of `T` (by removing all elements of `S`).

2. **DP Transition:**
   - `dp[i][j]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]` minus `dp[i-1][j-1]` to avoid double-counting.
   - If `s[i] == t[j]`, then `dp[i][j]` is incremented by `dp[i-1][j-1]` to account for the matching subsequence.

3. **Final Result:**
   - The final result is `dp[n][m]`, which represents the number of ways to match the subsequences of `S` and `T` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

By making these corrections, the program will correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
