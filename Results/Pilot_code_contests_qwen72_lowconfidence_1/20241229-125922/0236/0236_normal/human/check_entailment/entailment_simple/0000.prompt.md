You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: User ainta loves to play with cards. He has a cards containing letter "o" and b cards containing letter "x". He arranges the cards in a row, and calculates the score of the deck by the formula below.

  1. At first, the score is 0. 
  2. For each block of contiguous "o"s with length x the score increases by x2. 
  3. For each block of contiguous "x"s with length y the score decreases by y2. 



For example, if a = 6, b = 3 and ainta have arranged the cards in the order, that is described by string "ooxoooxxo", the score of the deck equals 22 - 12 + 32 - 22 + 12 = 9. That is because the deck has 5 blocks in total: "oo", "x", "ooo", "xx", "o".

User ainta likes big numbers, so he wants to maximize the score with the given cards. Help ainta make the score as big as possible. Note, that he has to arrange all his cards.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers a and b (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105; a + b ≥ 1) — the number of "o" cards and the number of "x" cards.

Output

In the first line print a single integer v — the maximum score that ainta can obtain.

In the second line print a + b characters describing the deck. If the k-th card of the deck contains "o", the k-th character must be "o". If the k-th card of the deck contains "x", the k-th character must be "x". The number of "o" characters must be equal to a, and the number of "x " characters must be equal to b. If there are many ways to maximize v, print any.

Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdout

func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1.
def func_1():
    a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if (not a or not b) :
        stdout.write(str(a * a - b * b) + '\n')
        stdout.write('o' * a + 'x' * b)
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, and `a`, `b` are updated to the values provided by the user input. Both `a` and `b` are non-zero.
    ans = -10 ** 17
    v = 0
    for i in xrange(1, a + 1):
        x, y = divmod(b, i + 1)
        
        t = i - 1 + (a - i + 1) * (a - i + 1) - y * (x + 1) * (x + 1) - (i + 1 - y
            ) * x * x
        
        if ans < t:
            ans = t
            v = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero. `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t` during the loop execution, or remains 0 if no such `i` exists. `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop, or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found. `i` is `a`, the final value of the loop counter. For each `i` from 1 to `a`, `x` and `y` are the quotient and remainder of `b` divided by `i + 1`, respectively. `t` is calculated as `i - 1 + (a - i + 1) * (a - i + 1) - y * (x + 1) * (x + 1) - (i + 1 - y) * x * x`.
    x, y = divmod(b, v + 1)
    c = ['o'] * (v - 1) + ['o' * (a - v + 1)]
    d = ['x' * (x + 1)] * y + ['x' * x] * (a + 1 - y)
    e = []
    for j in xrange(v):
        e.append(d[j])
        
        e.append(c[j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b \leq 105\) and \(a + b \geq 1\), both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t` during the loop execution or remains 0 if no such `i` exists, `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found, `i` is `a`, `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `c` is a list with `v - 1` elements, each being `'o'`, followed by one element which is `'o'` repeated `a - v + 1` times, `d` is a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times, followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times, `e` is a list containing `v` elements from `d` and `v` elements from `c` in the order they were appended.
    e.append(d[-1])
    stdout.write(str(ans) + '\n')
    stdout.write(''.join(e))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
