You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: User ainta loves to play with cards. He has a cards containing letter "o" and b cards containing letter "x". He arranges the cards in a row, and calculates the score of the deck by the formula below.

  1. At first, the score is 0. 
  2. For each block of contiguous "o"s with length x the score increases by x2. 
  3. For each block of contiguous "x"s with length y the score decreases by y2. 



For example, if a = 6, b = 3 and ainta have arranged the cards in the order, that is described by string "ooxoooxxo", the score of the deck equals 22 - 12 + 32 - 22 + 12 = 9. That is because the deck has 5 blocks in total: "oo", "x", "ooo", "xx", "o".

User ainta likes big numbers, so he wants to maximize the score with the given cards. Help ainta make the score as big as possible. Note, that he has to arrange all his cards.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers a and b (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105; a + b ≥ 1) — the number of "o" cards and the number of "x" cards.

Output

In the first line print a single integer v — the maximum score that ainta can obtain.

In the second line print a + b characters describing the deck. If the k-th card of the deck contains "o", the k-th character must be "o". If the k-th card of the deck contains "x", the k-th character must be "x". The number of "o" characters must be equal to a, and the number of "x " characters must be equal to b. If there are many ways to maximize v, print any.

Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

        stdout.write('o' * a + 'x' * b)
        return
    ans = -10 ** 17
    v = 0
    for i in xrange(1, a + 1):
        (x, y) = divmod(b, i + 1)
        t = i - 1 + (a - i + 1) * (a - i + 1) - y * (x + 1) * (x + 1) - (i + 1 - y) * x * x
        if ans < t:
            ans = t
            v = i
    (x, y) = divmod(b, v + 1)
    c = ['o'] * (v - 1) + ['o' * (a - v + 1)]
    d = ['x' * (x + 1)] * y + ['x' * x] * (a + 1 - y)
    e = []
    for j in xrange(v):
        e.append(d[j])
        e.append(c[j])
    e.append(d[-1])
    stdout.write(str(ans) + '\n')
    stdout.write(''.join(e))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where `a` (the number of "o" cards) is 0 and `b` (the number of "x" cards) is greater than 0. According to the problem description, the output should be `-b^2` followed by a string of `b` "x" characters. However, the current implementation incorrectly outputs `-b * b` followed by a string of `b` "x" characters, which is mathematically correct but violates the requirement to output the score and the arrangement in separate lines.

For example, if the input is `0 4`, the expected output should be:
```
-16
xxxx
```
However, the program outputs:
```
-16xxxx
```
This is incorrect because the score and the card arrangement are not printed on separate lines as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
