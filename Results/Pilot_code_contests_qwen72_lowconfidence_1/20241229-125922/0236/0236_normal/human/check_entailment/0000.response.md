Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where `a` (the number of "o" cards) is 0 and `b` (the number of "x" cards) is greater than 0. According to the problem description, the output should be `-b^2` followed by a string of `b` "x" characters. However, the current implementation incorrectly outputs `-b * b` followed by a string of `b` "x" characters, which is mathematically correct but violates the requirement to output the score and the arrangement in separate lines.

For example, if the input is `0 4`, the expected output should be:
```
-16
xxxx
```
However, the program outputs:
```
-16xxxx
```
This is incorrect because the score and the card arrangement are not printed on separate lines as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
