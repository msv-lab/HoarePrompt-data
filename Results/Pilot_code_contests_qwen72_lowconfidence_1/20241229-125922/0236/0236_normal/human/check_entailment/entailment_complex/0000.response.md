Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This discrepancy could lead to compatibility issues if the program is run in Python 3.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the cases where either `a` or `b` is zero, but it does not handle the general case optimally. Specifically, the logic for maximizing the score is flawed.

3. **Score Calculation**: The program attempts to maximize the score by dividing the `b` (number of 'x' cards) into `i + 1` segments and then calculating the score. However, the way it constructs the string `e` and the score `ans` is not optimal and may not always produce the maximum score.

4. **String Construction**: The program constructs the string `e` by alternating segments of 'o' and 'x' characters, but it does not ensure that the resulting string maximizes the score. The placement of 'o' and 'x' segments is not always optimal, especially when the number of 'o' and 'x' cards is large.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:

Consider the input `a = 6` and `b = 3`. The expected output should be:
```
9
ooxoooxxo
```
However, the provided program might produce a different output, such as:
```
8
ooxoxoxxo
```
This output is not optimal and does not maximize the score.

### Conclusion:

The program does not consistently produce the correct and optimal output for all possible inputs. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
