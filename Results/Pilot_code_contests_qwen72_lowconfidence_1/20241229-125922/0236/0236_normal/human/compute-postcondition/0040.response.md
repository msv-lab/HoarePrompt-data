The provided code snippet `e.append(c[j])` appends the `j`th element of the list `c` to the list `e`.

Let's analyze the impact of this operation step by step:

- `a` and `b` remain non-negative integers within the given constraints.
- `v` remains greater than 0.
- `ans` remains unchanged unless it was updated during the loop (not shown in the snippet).
- `i` remains `a`.
- `x` remains the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`.
- `y` remains the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`.
- `c` remains a list with `v - 1` elements, each being `'o'`, followed by one element which is `'o'` repeated `a - v + 1` times.
- `d` remains a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times, followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times.
- `e` initially contains the element `d[j + 1]`, the `(j + 1)`th element of `c`, the element `d[j]`, the `j`th element of `c`, and the element `d[j]`. After the operation, `e` will also contain the `j`th element of `c` appended to it.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b \leq 105\) and \(a + b \geq 1\), both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `v` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found, `i` is `a`, `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `c` is a list with `v - 1` elements, each being `'o'`, followed by one element which is `'o'` repeated `a - v + 1` times, `d` is a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times, followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times, `e` is a list containing the element `d[j + 1]`, the `(j + 1)`th element of `c`, the element `d[j]`, the `j`th element of `c`, the element `d[j]`, and the `j`th element of `c`, `j` is `j + 1`.**
