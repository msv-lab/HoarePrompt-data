The code `e.append(d[-1])` appends the last element of list `d` to the list `e`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `e` initially contains `v` elements from `d` and `v` elements from `c`.
- After executing the code, `e` will contain `v` elements from `c`, `v` elements from `d`, and one additional element, which is the last element of `d`.

The specific value of the last element of `d` depends on the values of `y`, `x`, and the structure of `d`:
- If `y > 0`, the last element of `d` is the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times.
- If `y == 0`, the last element of `d` is the string `'x'` repeated `x` times.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b \leq 105\) and \(a + b \geq 1\).
- Both `a` and `b` are non-zero.
- `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t` during the loop execution or remains 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found.
- `i` is `a`.
- `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`.
- `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`.
- `c` is a list with `v - 1` elements, each being `'o'`, followed by one element which is `'o'` repeated `a - v + 1` times.
- `d` is a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times, followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times.
- `e` is a list containing `v` elements from `c`, `v` elements from `d`, and the last element of `d`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b \leq 105\) and \(a + b \geq 1\), both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t` during the loop execution or remains 0 if no such `i` exists, `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found, `i` is `a`, `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `c` is a list with `v - 1` elements, each being `'o'`, followed by one element which is `'o'` repeated `a - v + 1` times, `d` is a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times, followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times, `e` is a list containing `v` elements from `c`, `v` elements from `d`, and the last element of `d`.**
