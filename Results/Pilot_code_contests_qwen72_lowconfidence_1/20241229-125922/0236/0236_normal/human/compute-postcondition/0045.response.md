The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, the problem statement mentions parameters `a` and `b` which are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1. Given this context, the function always returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`.**
