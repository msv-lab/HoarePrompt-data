The code snippet modifies the list `d` based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `a`. Here’s the step-by-step impact of the code:

1. `d` is initialized as a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times.
2. This is followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero.
- `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t` during the loop execution or remains 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found.
- `i` is `a`, the final value of the loop counter.
- `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`.
- `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`.
- `c` is a list with `v - 1` elements, each being `'o'`, followed by one element which is `'o'` repeated `a - v + 1` times.

After executing the code snippet:
- `d` is a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times, followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t` during the loop execution or remains 0 if no such `i` exists, `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found, `i` is `a`, the final value of the loop counter, `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `c` is a list with `v - 1` elements, each being `'o'`, followed by one element which is `'o'` repeated `a - v + 1` times, `d` is a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times, followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times.**
