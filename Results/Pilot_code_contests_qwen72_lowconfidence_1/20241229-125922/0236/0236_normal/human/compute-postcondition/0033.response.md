The code `e.append(d[j])` appends the element at index `j` of the list `d` to the list `e`. Here's the impact on the program state:

- `e` was initially an empty list and now contains the element `d[j]`.
- The rest of the variables (`a`, `b`, `v`, `ans`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `c`, `d`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b \leq 105\) and \(a + b \geq 1\), both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `v` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found, `i` is `a`, the final value of the loop counter, `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `c` is a list with `v - 1` elements, each being `'o'`, followed by one element which is `'o'` repeated `a - v + 1` times, `d` is a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times, followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times, `e` is a list containing the element `d[j]`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b \leq 105\) and \(a + b \geq 1\), both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `v` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found, `i` is `a`, the final value of the loop counter, `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `c` is a list with `v - 1` elements, each being `'o'`, followed by one element which is `'o'` repeated `a - v + 1` times, `d` is a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times, followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times, `e` is a list containing the element `d[j]`.**
