The code snippet provided updates the value of `ans` to the current value of `t`. Given that the initial state specifies the values of `a`, `b`, `v`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged and `ans` initially holds a very large negative number, the only change in the state is the assignment of `t` to `ans`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- The values of `a`, `b`, `v`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is now equal to `t`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `v`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, `ans` is equal to `t`.**
