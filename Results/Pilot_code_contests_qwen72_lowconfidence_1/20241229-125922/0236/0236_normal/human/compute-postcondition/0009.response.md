The code `x, y = divmod(b, i + 1)` calculates the quotient and remainder when `b` is divided by `i + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2. Therefore, `x` will be the quotient of `b` divided by 2, and `y` will be the remainder.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero.
- `ans` is -10000000000000000000.
- `v` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

After executing the code:
- `x` is `b // 2`.
- `y` is `b % 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `ans` is -10000000000000000000, `v` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is `b // 2`, `y` is `b % 2`**
