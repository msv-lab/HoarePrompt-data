The code writes the result of the expression `a * a - b * b` to the standard output followed by a newline character. Given the initial conditions, either `a` or `b` is 0, which simplifies the expression:

- If `a` is 0, the expression becomes `-b * b`.
- If `b` is 0, the expression becomes `a * a`.

Since the values of `a` and `b` are non-negative and either `a` or `b` is 0, the output will be either `a * a` or `-b * b`. The values of `a` and `b` themselves are not modified by this code.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1. The values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the values provided by the user input. Either `a` is 0 or `b` is 0. The expression `a * a - b * b` has been written to stdout.**
