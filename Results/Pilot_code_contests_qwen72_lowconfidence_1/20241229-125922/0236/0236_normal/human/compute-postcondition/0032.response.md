To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given state and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b \leq 105\) and \(a + b \geq 1\), both `a` and `b` are non-zero.
- `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t` during the loop execution or remains 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found.
- `i` is `a`, the final value of the loop counter.
- `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`.
- `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`.
- `c` is a list with `v - 1` elements, each being `'o'`, followed by one element which is `'o'` repeated `a - v + 1` times.
- `d` is a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times, followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times.
- `e` is an empty list.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(v):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `v` is greater than 0. This is because `xrange(v)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `v-1`, and if `v` is 0, the sequence is empty, and the loop will not execute.

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - `v` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `c`, `d`, and `e`) do not directly affect the loop condition but are part of the overall state.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to guarantee that `v` is greater than 0. The other variables remain as they are since they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b \leq 105\) and \(a + b \geq 1\), both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `v` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found, `i` is `a`, the final value of the loop counter, `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `c` is a list with `v - 1` elements, each being `'o'`, followed by one element which is `'o'` repeated `a - v + 1` times, `d` is a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times, followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times, `e` is an empty list.**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
