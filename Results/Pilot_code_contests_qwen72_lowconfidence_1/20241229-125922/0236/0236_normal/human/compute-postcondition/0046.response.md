Functionality: ** The function reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` from the user input, where \(0 \leq a, b \leq 105\) and \(a + b \geq 1\). If either `a` or `b` is zero, it prints the result of \(a^2 - b^2\) followed by a string consisting of `a` 'o' characters and `b` 'x' characters. If both `a` and `b` are non-zero, it calculates a value `ans` and an index `v` that maximize a specific formula involving `a` and `b`. It then constructs a string `e` by alternating segments of 'o' and 'x' characters based on the value of `v` and the quotient and remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`. Finally, it prints `ans` followed by the constructed string `e`. The function always returns `None`. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `a` or `b` is zero, the function correctly handles this case by printing \(a^2 - b^2\) and a string of `a` 'o' characters and `b` 'x' characters.
- If both `a` and `b` are non-zero, the function calculates `ans` and `v` correctly but does not handle the case where `a` is 1 separately, which might lead to incorrect segment construction in the string `e`.
- The function assumes that `a` and `b` are valid inputs within the specified range, but it does not explicitly check for this condition. If invalid inputs are provided, the behavior is undefined.
