Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero. `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t` during the loop execution, or remains 0 if no such `i` exists. `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop, or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found. `i` is `a`, the final value of the loop counter. For each `i` from 1 to `a`, `x` and `y` are the quotient and remainder of `b` divided by `i + 1`, respectively. `t` is calculated as `i - 1 + (a - i + 1) * (a - i + 1) - y * (x + 1) * (x + 1) - (i + 1 - y) * x * x`.**
