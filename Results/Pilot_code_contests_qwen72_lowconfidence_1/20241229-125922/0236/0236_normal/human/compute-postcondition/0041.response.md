To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initialization**: The initial state of the variables is given. `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with specific constraints, `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t`, `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated, `i` is `a`, `x` and `y` are derived from `b` and `v`, `c` and `d` are lists constructed based on `a`, `b`, and `v`, and `e` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over the range of `v` and appends elements from `d` and `c` to the list `e`.

3. **Impact of Each Iteration**:
   - For each iteration `j`:
     - `e.append(d[j])` adds the `j`th element of `d` to `e`.
     - `e.append(c[j])` adds the `j`th element of `c` to `e`.

4. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - After `v` iterations, `e` will contain `v` elements from `d` and `v` elements from `c`.
   - The final state of `e` will be a concatenation of elements from `d` and `c` in the order they were appended.

Given this, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b \leq 105\) and \(a + b \geq 1\), both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t` during the loop execution or remains 0 if no such `i` exists, `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found, `i` is `a`, `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `c` is a list with `v - 1` elements, each being `'o'`, followed by one element which is `'o'` repeated `a - v + 1` times, `d` is a list with `y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `(x + 1)` times, followed by `a + 1 - y` elements, each being the string `'x'` repeated `x` times, `e` is a list containing `v` elements from `d` and `v` elements from `c` in the order they were appended.**
