The code snippet `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1.

After executing the code, the new values of `a` and `b` are determined by the user input. However, the constraints that `a` and `b` are non-negative integers and that their sum is at least 1 remain valid, as the input is expected to satisfy these conditions.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, and `a`, `b` are updated to the values provided by the user input.**
