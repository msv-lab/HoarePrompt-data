The code `x, y = divmod(b, i + 1)` changes the values of `x` and `y` by performing the `divmod` operation on `b` and `i + 1`. Given the initial state, let's break down the impact:

- `i` is 3, so `i + 1` is 4.
- `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq b \leq 105\) and `b` is non-zero.
- `divmod(b, 4)` returns a tuple where the first element is the quotient of `b` divided by 4, and the second element is the remainder.

Thus, `x` will be the quotient of `b` divided by 4, and `y` will be the remainder of `b` divided by 4.

The other variables (`a`, `v`, `t`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b \leq 105\) and \(a + b \geq 1\), both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `v` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is \(b // 4\), `y` is \(b \% 4\), `a` is \(\geq 2\), `t` is \(1 + (a - 1)^2 - y \cdot (b // 3 + 1)^2 - (3 - y) \cdot (b // 3)^2\), `ans` is \(-10000000000000000000\) if `ans` < `t`, otherwise `ans` remains \(-10000000000000000000\) and `v` remains 1.**
