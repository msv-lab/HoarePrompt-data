Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `v` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `b // 3`, `y` is `b % 3`, `a` is ≥ 2, `t` is `1 + (a - 1)^2 - y * (b // 3 + 1)^2 - (3 - y) * (b // 3)^2`. If `ans` < `t`, then `ans` is updated to `1 + (a - 1)^2 - y * (b // 3 + 1)^2 - (3 - y) * (b // 3)^2` and `v` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains `-10000000000000000000` and `v` remains 1.***
