The given Python code snippet writes a string to the standard output (stdout) composed of 'o' characters repeated `a` times followed by 'x' characters repeated `b` times. Given the conditions that either `a` is 0 or `b` is 0, the output will consist of either only 'o' characters or only 'x' characters, depending on which of `a` or `b` is zero.

- If `a` is 0, the output will be `b` 'x' characters.
- If `b` is 0, the output will be `a` 'o' characters.

The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged after this operation. The initial conditions that `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, and that either `a` is 0 or `b` is 0, still hold true.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1. Either `a` is 0 or `b` is 0. The expression `a * a - b * b` has been written to stdout. A string of 'o' repeated `a` times and 'x' repeated `b` times has been written to stdout.**
