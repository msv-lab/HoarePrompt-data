The provided code snippet updates the values of `x` and `y` using the `divmod` function, which returns a tuple containing the quotient and remainder when `b` is divided by `i + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero.
- `ans` is -10000000000000000000 initially.
- `v` is set to 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is `b // 2`.
- `y` is `b % 2`.
- `a` must be greater than or equal to 2.

The code snippet:
```python
x, y = divmod(b, i + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero.
   - `ans` is -10000000000000000000.
   - `v` is 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is `b // 2`.
   - `y` is `b % 2`.
   - `a` is ≥ 2.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `divmod` function is called with `b` and `i + 1` as arguments.
   - `i + 1` is 3 (since `i` is 2).
   - `divmod(b, 3)` returns a tuple `(quotient, remainder)` where:
     - `quotient` is the integer division of `b` by 3 (`b // 3`).
     - `remainder` is the remainder of `b` divided by 3 (`b % 3`).

3. **Variable Updates:**
   - `x` is updated to `b // 3`.
   - `y` is updated to `b % 3`.

### Output State:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero.
- `ans` is -10000000000000000000.
- `v` is 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is `b // 3`.
- `y` is `b % 3`.
- `a` is ≥ 2.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `ans` is -10000000000000000000, `v` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `b // 3`, `y` is `b % 3`, `a` is ≥ 2.**
