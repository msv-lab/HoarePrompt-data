To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

### Current State:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero.
- `ans` is -10000000000000000000 initially.
- `t` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `b`:
  - If `b % 2 == 0`, then `t = a * a - 2 * (b // 2) * (b // 2)`.
  - If `b % 2 == 1`, then `t = a * a - (b // 2 + 1) * (b // 2 + 1) - (b // 2) * (b // 2)`.
- If `ans < t`, then `ans` is updated to `t`.
- `v` is set to 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is `b // 2`.
- `y` is `b % 2`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(1, a + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `a + 1`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < a + 1`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` must be 2, and `a` must be greater than or equal to 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` must be incremented to 2.
- `a` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero. `ans` is -10000000000000000000 initially. If `ans` < `t`, then `ans` is updated to `t`, where `t` is `a * a - 2 * (b // 2) * (b // 2)` if `b % 2 == 0` or `a * a - (b // 2 + 1) * (b // 2 + 1) - (b // 2) * (b // 2)` if `b % 2 == 1`. Additionally, `v` is set to 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `b // 2`, and `y` is `b % 2`. `a` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
