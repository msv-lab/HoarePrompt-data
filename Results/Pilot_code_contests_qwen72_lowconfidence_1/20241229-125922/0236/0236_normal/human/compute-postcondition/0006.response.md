The code assigns the value `-10 ** 17` to the variable `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `a` and `b`, which remain non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105, and both are non-zero with a + b ≥ 1.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, and `a`, `b` are updated to the values provided by the user input. Both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `ans` is -10000000000000000000**
