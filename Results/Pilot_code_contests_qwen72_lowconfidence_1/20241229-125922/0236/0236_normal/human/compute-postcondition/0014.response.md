Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero. `ans` is -10000000000000000000 initially. If `ans` < `t`, then `ans` is updated to `t`, where `t` is `a * a - 2 * (b // 2) * (b // 2)` if `b % 2 == 0` or `a * a - (b // 2 + 1) * (b // 2 + 1) - (b // 2) * (b // 2)` if `b % 2 == 1`. Additionally, `v` is set to 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `b // 2`, and `y` is `b % 2`. If `ans` is not less than `t`, then `ans`, `v`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.***
