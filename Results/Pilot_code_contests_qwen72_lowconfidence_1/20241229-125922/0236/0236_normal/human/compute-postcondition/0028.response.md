Given the initial state and the provided code snippet:

Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero.
- `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t` during the loop execution, or remains 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop, or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found.
- `i` is `a`, the final value of the loop counter.
- For each `i` from 1 to `a`, `x` and `y` are the quotient and remainder of `b` divided by `i + 1`, respectively.
- `t` is calculated as `i - 1 + (a - i + 1) * (a - i + 1) - y * (x + 1) * (x + 1) - (i + 1 - y) * x * x`.

Code Snippet:
```
x, y = divmod(b, v + 1)
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The code snippet `x, y = divmod(b, v + 1)` calculates the quotient `x` and remainder `y` of `b` divided by `v + 1`.
2. The value of `b` remains unchanged.
3. The value of `v` remains unchanged.
4. The new values of `x` and `y` are determined by the division of `b` by `v + 1`.

Output State:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero.
- `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t` during the loop execution, or remains 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop, or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found.
- `i` is `a`, the final value of the loop counter.
- `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`.
- `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 105 and a + b ≥ 1, both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `v` is the value of `i` that maximizes `t` during the loop execution or remains 0 if no such `i` exists, `ans` is the maximum value of `t` calculated during the loop or remains -10000000000000000000 if no such `t` is found, `i` is `a`, the final value of the loop counter, `x` is the quotient of `b` divided by `v + 1`, `y` is the remainder of `b` divided by `v + 1`.**
