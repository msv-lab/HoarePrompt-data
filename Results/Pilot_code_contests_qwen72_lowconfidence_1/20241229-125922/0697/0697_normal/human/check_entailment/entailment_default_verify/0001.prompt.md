You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dora loves adventures quite a lot. During some journey she encountered an amazing city, which is formed by n streets along the Eastern direction and m streets across the Southern direction. Naturally, this city has nm intersections. At any intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street there is a monumental skyscraper. Dora instantly became curious and decided to explore the heights of the city buildings.

When Dora passes through the intersection of the i-th Eastern and j-th Southern street she examines those two streets. After Dora learns the heights of all the skyscrapers on those two streets she wonders: how one should reassign heights to the skyscrapers on those two streets, so that the maximum height would be as small as possible and the result of comparing the heights of any two skyscrapers on one street wouldn't change.

Formally, on every of nm intersections Dora solves an independent problem. She sees n + m - 1 skyscrapers and for each of them she knows its real height. Moreover, any two heights can be compared to get a result "greater", "smaller" or "equal". Now Dora wants to select some integer x and assign every skyscraper a height from 1 to x. When assigning heights, Dora wants to preserve the relative order of the skyscrapers in both streets. That is, the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in the current Eastern street shouldn't change and the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in current Southern street shouldn't change as well. Note that skyscrapers located on the Southern street are not compared with skyscrapers located on the Eastern street only. However, the skyscraper located at the streets intersection can be compared with both Southern and Eastern skyscrapers. For every intersection Dora wants to independently calculate the minimum possible x.

For example, if the intersection and the two streets corresponding to it look as follows:

<image>

Then it is optimal to replace the heights of the skyscrapers as follows (note that all comparisons "less", "equal", "greater" inside the Eastern street and inside the Southern street are preserved)

<image>

The largest used number is 5, hence the answer for this intersection would be 5.

Help Dora to compute the answers for each intersection.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of streets going in the Eastern direction and the number of the streets going in Southern direction.

Each of the following n lines contains m integers a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, ..., a_{i,m} (1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9). The integer a_{i,j}, located on j-th position in the i-th line denotes the height of the skyscraper at the intersection of the i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern direction.

Output

Print n lines containing m integers each. The integer x_{i,j}, located on j-th position inside the i-th line is an answer for the problem at the intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street.

Note

In the first example, it's not possible to decrease the maximum used height for the problem at any intersection, hence we don't have to change any heights.

In the second example, the answers are as follows: 

  * For the intersection of the first line and the first column <image>
  * For the intersection of the first line and the second column <image>
  * For the intersection of the second line and the first column <image>
  * For the intersection of the second line and the second column <image>

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not contain the main logic to process the input and produce the required output. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined, but there is no code to read the input, call these functions, and generate the output. Additionally, the variables `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are used in `func_2` but are not defined anywhere in the provided code. This means the program will fail to run correctly for any input because it lacks essential parts of the solution.

To be correct, the program should:
1. Read the input values for `n` and `m`.
2. Read the matrix of skyscraper heights.
3. Process the matrix to determine the relative heights for each row and column using `func_1`.
4. Use `func_2` to compute the minimum possible value of `x` for each intersection.
5. Print the results in the specified format.

Since the program is missing these crucial steps, it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `i` and `j`, which are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively. It returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street and the j-th Southern street, adjusted by the positive difference in their heights at the intersection (i, j).

Specifically:
- If the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][0][j]`) is greater than the height of the skyscraper at the same intersection on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][0][i]`), the function returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) plus the positive difference (`rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`).
- Otherwise, if the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street is less than or equal to the height of the skyscraper at the same intersection on the j-th Southern street, the function returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) plus the positive difference (`columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]`).

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `i` or `j` are out of bounds (i.e., `i >= n` or `j >= m`), the function will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access elements in `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` lists.
- If `rows_ordered` or `columns_ordered` are not properly initialized or contain invalid data (e.g., empty lists, non-tuple elements, or tuples with incorrect lengths), the function will raise a `TypeError` or `IndexError`.

The function assumes that `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are correctly precomputed and that the indices `i` and `j` are within valid ranges.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
