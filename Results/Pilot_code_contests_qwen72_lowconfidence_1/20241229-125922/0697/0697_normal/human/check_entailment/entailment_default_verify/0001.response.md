Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code is indeed incomplete and lacks the necessary components to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The program does not include any code to read the input values for `n` and `m`, or the matrix of skyscraper heights. Without this, the program cannot start processing the data.

2. **Precomputation of `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered`**: The program does not define or initialize the variables `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered`. These variables are crucial for the function `func_2` to work correctly, but they are not provided or computed in the given code.

3. **Main Logic**: The program lacks the main logic to process the matrix, apply the functions `func_1` and `func_2`, and generate the required output. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined, but they are not called or used in any meaningful way within the program.

4. **Output Generation**: The program does not include any code to print the results in the specified format. Without this, the program cannot produce the required output.

Given these points, the program is incomplete and will not run correctly for any input. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is accurate.
