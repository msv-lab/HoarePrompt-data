Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the heights of the skyscrapers on the two streets are already in the desired order, and no reassignment is needed. Specifically, the function `func_2` adjusts the maximum height by the difference in heights at the intersection, which is unnecessary if the heights are already in the correct order. This can lead to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 2
1 2
3 4
```
The correct output should be:
```
2 3
3 2
```
However, the current implementation might produce:
```
3 3
3 3
```
This is because the function `func_2` unnecessarily increases the maximum height by the difference in heights at the intersection, even when the heights are already in the correct order. Therefore, the program does not meet the specification for every potential case.
