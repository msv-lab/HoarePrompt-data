Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the solution described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program lacks the main structure that reads input, processes the data using the defined functions, and outputs the results. Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incomplete Program Structure**:
   - The program does not include the necessary input reading logic to parse the input values `n` and `m`, and the matrix `a` representing the heights of the skyscrapers.
   - The program does not include the output logic to print the results in the required format.

2. **Missing Main Logic**:
   - The program defines two helper functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) but does not show how these functions are used to solve the problem for each intersection.
   - There is no loop or other mechanism to iterate over each intersection and apply the functions to solve the problem.

3. **Potential Issues in Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1` sorts the elements of a list and assigns ranks to them. However, it uses a fixed multiplier of 1000, which might not be sufficient if the number of elements exceeds 1000.
   - `func_2` calculates the maximum value needed to preserve the relative order of the skyscrapers, but it assumes that the `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` variables are already defined and correctly populated, which is not shown in the provided code.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
