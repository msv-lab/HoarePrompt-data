Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` and `stdin.readlines()`, which are not compatible with Python 3. In Python 3, `raw_input()` is replaced by `input()`, and `stdin.readlines()` should be used carefully to ensure it reads the correct number of lines. This can cause issues if the input is not handled correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to convert the heights of skyscrapers into a ranked order. However, the way it handles ties (equal heights) is not clear from the problem description. The problem requires preserving the relative order of heights, and the function should ensure that equal heights receive the same rank. The current implementation might not handle ties correctly.

3. **Function `func_2`**: The function `func_2` is responsible for determining the minimum possible height `x` for the intersection of the i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street. The logic in `func_2` is not entirely clear and might not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the way it calculates the `difference` and the final return value might not always produce the correct minimum `x`.

4. **Output Format**: The output format specified in the problem description requires printing `n` lines, each containing `m` integers. The program's output formatting is complex and might not match the required format exactly.

### Case Analysis:
- **Case 1**: For the input `2 3\n1 2 1\n2 1 2`, the expected output is `2 2 2\n2 2 2`. The program might produce the correct output for this specific case, but it is not guaranteed to work for all cases due to the issues mentioned above.

- **Case 2**: For the input `2 2\n1 2\n3 4`, the expected output is `2 3\n3 2`. The program's logic in `func_2` might not correctly handle the relative order of heights, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program does not consistently meet the requirements of the problem description due to issues with input handling, function logic, and output formatting. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
