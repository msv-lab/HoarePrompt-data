If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Dora loves adventures quite a lot. During some journey she encountered an amazing city, which is formed by n streets along the Eastern direction and m streets across the Southern direction. Naturally, this city has nm intersections. At any intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street there is a monumental skyscraper. Dora instantly became curious and decided to explore the heights of the city buildings.

When Dora passes through the intersection of the i-th Eastern and j-th Southern street she examines those two streets. After Dora learns the heights of all the skyscrapers on those two streets she wonders: how one should reassign heights to the skyscrapers on those two streets, so that the maximum height would be as small as possible and the result of comparing the heights of any two skyscrapers on one street wouldn't change.

Formally, on every of nm intersections Dora solves an independent problem. She sees n + m - 1 skyscrapers and for each of them she knows its real height. Moreover, any two heights can be compared to get a result "greater", "smaller" or "equal". Now Dora wants to select some integer x and assign every skyscraper a height from 1 to x. When assigning heights, Dora wants to preserve the relative order of the skyscrapers in both streets. That is, the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in the current Eastern street shouldn't change and the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in current Southern street shouldn't change as well. Note that skyscrapers located on the Southern street are not compared with skyscrapers located on the Eastern street only. However, the skyscraper located at the streets intersection can be compared with both Southern and Eastern skyscrapers. For every intersection Dora wants to independently calculate the minimum possible x.

For example, if the intersection and the two streets corresponding to it look as follows:

<image>

Then it is optimal to replace the heights of the skyscrapers as follows (note that all comparisons "less", "equal", "greater" inside the Eastern street and inside the Southern street are preserved)

<image>

The largest used number is 5, hence the answer for this intersection would be 5.

Help Dora to compute the answers for each intersection.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of streets going in the Eastern direction and the number of the streets going in Southern direction.

Each of the following n lines contains m integers a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, ..., a_{i,m} (1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9). The integer a_{i,j}, located on j-th position in the i-th line denotes the height of the skyscraper at the intersection of the i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern direction.

Output

Print n lines containing m integers each. The integer x_{i,j}, located on j-th position inside the i-th line is an answer for the problem at the intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street.

Note

In the first example, it's not possible to decrease the maximum used height for the problem at any intersection, hence we don't have to change any heights.

In the second example, the answers are as follows: 

  * For the intersection of the first line and the first column <image>
  * For the intersection of the first line and the second column <image>
  * For the intersection of the second line and the first column <image>
  * For the intersection of the second line and the second column <image>
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

(n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
lines = stdin.readlines()
rows = [None] * n
for i in xrange(n):
    rows[i] = map(int, lines[i].split(' '))
columns = [[rows[i][j] for i in xrange(n)] for j in xrange(m)]
rows_ordered = [func_1(row) for row in rows]
columns_ordered = [func_1(column) for column in columns]
answer_matrix = [[func_2(i, j) for i in xrange(n)] for j in xrange(m)]
stdout.write('\n'.join([' '.join([str(answer_matrix[j][i]) for j in xrange(m)]) for i in xrange(n)]))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    """example: [10,20,14,10] -> ([1,3,2,1], 3). returns list of positive integers with equivalent pairwise comparisons (<,=,>) to list."""
    xs = sorted([(xs[i] * 1000 + i) for i in xrange(len(xs))])
    ys = [0] * len(xs)
    last_x = None
    j = 0
    for w in xs:
        x = w / 1000
        
        i = w % 1000
        
        if x == last_x:
            ys[i] = j
        else:
            j += 1
            ys[i] = j
        
        last_x = x
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `xs` is a sorted list of integers, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list where each element `ys[i]` is the position (1-based) of the original value of `xs[i]` among the unique original values in `xs`, `last_x` is the original value of the last element in `xs`, `j` is the number of unique original values in `xs` plus 1.
    return ys, j
    #The program returns `ys`, which is a list where each element `ys[i]` represents the 1-based position of the original value of `xs[i]` among the unique original values in `xs`, and `j`, which is the number of unique original values in `xs` plus 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i and j are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively, such that 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m. Additionally, `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are precomputed lists where `rows_ordered[i]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street, and `columns_ordered[j]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street.
def func_2(i, j):
    if (rows_ordered[i][0][j] > columns_ordered[j][0][i]) :
        difference = rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]
        return max(rows_ordered[i][1], columns_ordered[j][1] + difference)
        #The program returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) plus the positive difference (`difference`). The difference is calculated as `rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`, where `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street and `columns_ordered[j][0][i]` is the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the j-th Southern street.
    else :
        difference = columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]
        return max(columns_ordered[j][1], rows_ordered[i][1] + difference)
        #The program returns the maximum value between `columns_ordered[j][1]` and `rows_ordered[i][1] + difference`, where `difference` is `columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]`. The height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is less than or equal to the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `columns_ordered[j][0][i]`.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
