You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dora loves adventures quite a lot. During some journey she encountered an amazing city, which is formed by n streets along the Eastern direction and m streets across the Southern direction. Naturally, this city has nm intersections. At any intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street there is a monumental skyscraper. Dora instantly became curious and decided to explore the heights of the city buildings.

When Dora passes through the intersection of the i-th Eastern and j-th Southern street she examines those two streets. After Dora learns the heights of all the skyscrapers on those two streets she wonders: how one should reassign heights to the skyscrapers on those two streets, so that the maximum height would be as small as possible and the result of comparing the heights of any two skyscrapers on one street wouldn't change.

Formally, on every of nm intersections Dora solves an independent problem. She sees n + m - 1 skyscrapers and for each of them she knows its real height. Moreover, any two heights can be compared to get a result "greater", "smaller" or "equal". Now Dora wants to select some integer x and assign every skyscraper a height from 1 to x. When assigning heights, Dora wants to preserve the relative order of the skyscrapers in both streets. That is, the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in the current Eastern street shouldn't change and the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in current Southern street shouldn't change as well. Note that skyscrapers located on the Southern street are not compared with skyscrapers located on the Eastern street only. However, the skyscraper located at the streets intersection can be compared with both Southern and Eastern skyscrapers. For every intersection Dora wants to independently calculate the minimum possible x.

For example, if the intersection and the two streets corresponding to it look as follows:

<image>

Then it is optimal to replace the heights of the skyscrapers as follows (note that all comparisons "less", "equal", "greater" inside the Eastern street and inside the Southern street are preserved)

<image>

The largest used number is 5, hence the answer for this intersection would be 5.

Help Dora to compute the answers for each intersection.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of streets going in the Eastern direction and the number of the streets going in Southern direction.

Each of the following n lines contains m integers a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, ..., a_{i,m} (1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9). The integer a_{i,j}, located on j-th position in the i-th line denotes the height of the skyscraper at the intersection of the i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern direction.

Output

Print n lines containing m integers each. The integer x_{i,j}, located on j-th position inside the i-th line is an answer for the problem at the intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street.

Note

In the first example, it's not possible to decrease the maximum used height for the problem at any intersection, hence we don't have to change any heights.

In the second example, the answers are as follows: 

  * For the intersection of the first line and the first column <image>
  * For the intersection of the first line and the second column <image>
  * For the intersection of the second line and the first column <image>
  * For the intersection of the second line and the second column <image>

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the solution described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program lacks the main structure that reads input, processes the data using the defined functions, and outputs the results. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incomplete Program Structure**:
   - The program does not include the necessary input reading logic to parse the input values `n` and `m`, and the matrix `a` representing the heights of the skyscrapers.
   - The program does not include the output logic to print the results in the required format.

2. **Missing Main Logic**:
   - The program defines two helper functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) but does not show how these functions are used to solve the problem for each intersection.
   - There is no loop or other mechanism to iterate over each intersection and apply the functions to solve the problem.

3. **Potential Issues in Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1` sorts the elements of a list and assigns ranks to them. However, it uses a fixed multiplier of 1000, which might not be sufficient if the number of elements exceeds 1000.
   - `func_2` calculates the maximum value needed to preserve the relative order of the skyscrapers, but it assumes that the `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` variables are already defined and correctly populated, which is not shown in the provided code.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin, stdout

(n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
lines = stdin.readlines()
rows = [None] * n
for i in xrange(n):
    rows[i] = map(int, lines[i].split(' '))
columns = [[rows[i][j] for i in xrange(n)] for j in xrange(m)]
rows_ordered = [func_1(row) for row in rows]
columns_ordered = [func_1(column) for column in columns]
answer_matrix = [[func_2(i, j) for i in xrange(n)] for j in xrange(m)]
stdout.write('\n'.join([' '.join([str(answer_matrix[j][i]) for j in xrange(m)]) for i in xrange(n)]))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    """example: [10,20,14,10] -> ([1,3,2,1], 3). returns list of positive integers with equivalent pairwise comparisons (<,=,>) to list."""
    xs = sorted([(xs[i] * 1000 + i) for i in xrange(len(xs))])
    ys = [0] * len(xs)
    last_x = None
    j = 0
    for w in xs:
        x = w / 1000
        
        i = w % 1000
        
        if x == last_x:
            ys[i] = j
        else:
            j += 1
            ys[i] = j
        
        last_x = x
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `xs` is a sorted list of integers, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list where each element `ys[i]` is the position (1-based) of the original value of `xs[i]` among the unique original values in `xs`, `last_x` is the original value of the last element in `xs`, `j` is the number of unique original values in `xs` plus 1.
    return ys, j
    #The program returns `ys`, which is a list where each element `ys[i]` represents the 1-based position of the original value of `xs[i]` among the unique original values in `xs`, and `j`, which is the number of unique original values in `xs` plus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `xs` and returns a tuple `(ys, j)`. The list `ys` contains integers where each element `ys[i]` represents the 1-based position of the original value of `xs[i]` among the unique values in `xs`. The integer `j` is the number of unique values in `xs` plus 1. The function handles duplicates correctly by assigning the same position to equal values. If `xs` is empty, `ys` will be an empty list and `j` will be 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i and j are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively, such that 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m. Additionally, `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are precomputed lists where `rows_ordered[i]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street, and `columns_ordered[j]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street.
def func_2(i, j):
    if (rows_ordered[i][0][j] > columns_ordered[j][0][i]) :
        difference = rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]
        return max(rows_ordered[i][1], columns_ordered[j][1] + difference)
        #The program returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) plus the positive difference (`difference`). The difference is calculated as `rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`, where `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street and `columns_ordered[j][0][i]` is the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the j-th Southern street.
    else :
        difference = columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]
        return max(columns_ordered[j][1], rows_ordered[i][1] + difference)
        #The program returns the maximum value between `columns_ordered[j][1]` and `rows_ordered[i][1] + difference`, where `difference` is `columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]`. The height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is less than or equal to the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `columns_ordered[j][0][i]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `i` and `j`, which are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively. It returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street and the j-th Southern street, adjusted by the positive difference in their heights at the intersection (i, j).

Specifically:
- If the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][0][j]`) is greater than the height of the skyscraper at the same intersection on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][0][i]`), the function returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) plus the positive difference (`rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`).
- Otherwise, if the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street is less than or equal to the height of the skyscraper at the same intersection on the j-th Southern street, the function returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) plus the positive difference (`columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]`).

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `i` or `j` are out of bounds (i.e., `i >= n` or `j >= m`), the function will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access elements in `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` lists.
- If `rows_ordered` or `columns_ordered` are not properly initialized or contain invalid data (e.g., empty lists, non-tuple elements, or tuples with incorrect lengths), the function will raise a `TypeError` or `IndexError`.

The function assumes that `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are correctly precomputed and that the indices `i` and `j` are within valid ranges.
