You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dora loves adventures quite a lot. During some journey she encountered an amazing city, which is formed by n streets along the Eastern direction and m streets across the Southern direction. Naturally, this city has nm intersections. At any intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street there is a monumental skyscraper. Dora instantly became curious and decided to explore the heights of the city buildings.

When Dora passes through the intersection of the i-th Eastern and j-th Southern street she examines those two streets. After Dora learns the heights of all the skyscrapers on those two streets she wonders: how one should reassign heights to the skyscrapers on those two streets, so that the maximum height would be as small as possible and the result of comparing the heights of any two skyscrapers on one street wouldn't change.

Formally, on every of nm intersections Dora solves an independent problem. She sees n + m - 1 skyscrapers and for each of them she knows its real height. Moreover, any two heights can be compared to get a result "greater", "smaller" or "equal". Now Dora wants to select some integer x and assign every skyscraper a height from 1 to x. When assigning heights, Dora wants to preserve the relative order of the skyscrapers in both streets. That is, the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in the current Eastern street shouldn't change and the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in current Southern street shouldn't change as well. Note that skyscrapers located on the Southern street are not compared with skyscrapers located on the Eastern street only. However, the skyscraper located at the streets intersection can be compared with both Southern and Eastern skyscrapers. For every intersection Dora wants to independently calculate the minimum possible x.

For example, if the intersection and the two streets corresponding to it look as follows:

<image>

Then it is optimal to replace the heights of the skyscrapers as follows (note that all comparisons "less", "equal", "greater" inside the Eastern street and inside the Southern street are preserved)

<image>

The largest used number is 5, hence the answer for this intersection would be 5.

Help Dora to compute the answers for each intersection.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of streets going in the Eastern direction and the number of the streets going in Southern direction.

Each of the following n lines contains m integers a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, ..., a_{i,m} (1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9). The integer a_{i,j}, located on j-th position in the i-th line denotes the height of the skyscraper at the intersection of the i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern direction.

Output

Print n lines containing m integers each. The integer x_{i,j}, located on j-th position inside the i-th line is an answer for the problem at the intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street.

Note

In the first example, it's not possible to decrease the maximum used height for the problem at any intersection, hence we don't have to change any heights.

In the second example, the answers are as follows: 

  * For the intersection of the first line and the first column <image>
  * For the intersection of the first line and the second column <image>
  * For the intersection of the second line and the first column <image>
  * For the intersection of the second line and the second column <image>

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `xs` and returns a tuple `(ys, j)`. The list `ys` contains integers where each element `ys[i]` represents the 1-based position of the original value of `xs[i]` among the unique values in `xs`. The integer `j` is the number of unique values in `xs` plus 1. The function handles duplicates correctly by assigning the same position to equal values. If `xs` is empty, `ys` will be an empty list and `j` will be 1.

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `i` and `j`, which are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively. It returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street and the j-th Southern street, adjusted by the positive difference in their heights at the intersection (i, j).

Specifically:
- If the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][0][j]`) is greater than the height of the skyscraper at the same intersection on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][0][i]`), the function returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) plus the positive difference (`rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`).
- Otherwise, if the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street is less than or equal to the height of the skyscraper at the same intersection on the j-th Southern street, the function returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) plus the positive difference (`columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]`).

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `i` or `j` are out of bounds (i.e., `i >= n` or `j >= m`), the function will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access elements in `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` lists.
- If `rows_ordered` or `columns_ordered` are not properly initialized or contain invalid data (e.g., empty lists, non-tuple elements, or tuples with incorrect lengths), the function will raise a `TypeError` or `IndexError`.

The function assumes that `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are correctly precomputed and that the indices `i` and `j` are within valid ranges.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
