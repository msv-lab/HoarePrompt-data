Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The code reads the input dimensions `n` and `m` and the matrix of skyscraper heights.
   - It then constructs the `rows` and `columns` arrays, which are correctly initialized with the input data.

2. **Ordering and Unique Values**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for converting the heights into a sequence of unique ranks while preserving the relative order of the heights.
   - This function works correctly by sorting the heights and assigning ranks based on the sorted order. It handles duplicates by assigning the same rank to equal heights.
   - The function returns a tuple containing the ranked heights and the number of unique ranks plus one.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Possible x**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the minimum possible value of `x` for each intersection.
   - It correctly handles the comparison of heights at the intersection and adjusts the maximum height accordingly.
   - The function ensures that the relative order of heights in both the Eastern and Southern streets is preserved.

4. **Output**:
   - The final output is constructed by applying `func_2` to each intersection and printing the results in the required format.

The code handles all potential cases, including:
- **Equal heights**: The code correctly assigns the same rank to equal heights.
- **Different heights**: The code correctly calculates the maximum height needed to preserve the relative order of heights.
- **Edge cases**: The code handles the boundaries of the matrix and ensures that all indices are within valid ranges.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program meets all the requirements and works correctly for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
