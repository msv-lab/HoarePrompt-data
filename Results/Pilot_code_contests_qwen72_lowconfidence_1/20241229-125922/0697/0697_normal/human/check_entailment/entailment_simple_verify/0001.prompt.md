You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dora loves adventures quite a lot. During some journey she encountered an amazing city, which is formed by n streets along the Eastern direction and m streets across the Southern direction. Naturally, this city has nm intersections. At any intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street there is a monumental skyscraper. Dora instantly became curious and decided to explore the heights of the city buildings.

When Dora passes through the intersection of the i-th Eastern and j-th Southern street she examines those two streets. After Dora learns the heights of all the skyscrapers on those two streets she wonders: how one should reassign heights to the skyscrapers on those two streets, so that the maximum height would be as small as possible and the result of comparing the heights of any two skyscrapers on one street wouldn't change.

Formally, on every of nm intersections Dora solves an independent problem. She sees n + m - 1 skyscrapers and for each of them she knows its real height. Moreover, any two heights can be compared to get a result "greater", "smaller" or "equal". Now Dora wants to select some integer x and assign every skyscraper a height from 1 to x. When assigning heights, Dora wants to preserve the relative order of the skyscrapers in both streets. That is, the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in the current Eastern street shouldn't change and the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in current Southern street shouldn't change as well. Note that skyscrapers located on the Southern street are not compared with skyscrapers located on the Eastern street only. However, the skyscraper located at the streets intersection can be compared with both Southern and Eastern skyscrapers. For every intersection Dora wants to independently calculate the minimum possible x.

For example, if the intersection and the two streets corresponding to it look as follows:

<image>

Then it is optimal to replace the heights of the skyscrapers as follows (note that all comparisons "less", "equal", "greater" inside the Eastern street and inside the Southern street are preserved)

<image>

The largest used number is 5, hence the answer for this intersection would be 5.

Help Dora to compute the answers for each intersection.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of streets going in the Eastern direction and the number of the streets going in Southern direction.

Each of the following n lines contains m integers a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, ..., a_{i,m} (1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9). The integer a_{i,j}, located on j-th position in the i-th line denotes the height of the skyscraper at the intersection of the i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern direction.

Output

Print n lines containing m integers each. The integer x_{i,j}, located on j-th position inside the i-th line is an answer for the problem at the intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street.

Examples

Note

In the first example, it's not possible to decrease the maximum used height for the problem at any intersection, hence we don't have to change any heights.

In the second example, the answers are as follows: 

  * For the intersection of the first line and the first column <image>
  * For the intersection of the first line and the second column <image>
  * For the intersection of the second line and the first column <image>
  * For the intersection of the second line and the second column <image>

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not contain the main logic to process the input and produce the required output. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined, but there is no code to read the input, call these functions, and generate the output. Additionally, the variables `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are used in `func_2` but are not defined anywhere in the provided code. This means the program will fail to run correctly for any input because it lacks essential parts of the solution.

To be correct, the program should:
1. Read the input values for `n` and `m`.
2. Read the matrix of skyscraper heights.
3. Process the matrix to determine the relative heights for each row and column using `func_1`.
4. Use `func_2` to compute the minimum possible value of `x` for each intersection.
5. Print the results in the specified format.

Since the program is missing these crucial steps, it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i and j are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively, such that 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m. Additionally, `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are precomputed lists where `rows_ordered[i]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street, and `columns_ordered[j]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street.

The difference is calculated as `rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`, where `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street and `columns_ordered[j][0][i]` is the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the j-th Southern street.

The height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is less than or equal to the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `columns_ordered[j][0][i]`.
