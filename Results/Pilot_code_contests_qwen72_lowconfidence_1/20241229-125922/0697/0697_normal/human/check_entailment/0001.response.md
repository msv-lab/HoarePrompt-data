Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not contain the main logic to process the input and produce the required output. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined, but there is no code to read the input, call these functions, and generate the output. Additionally, the variables `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are used in `func_2` but are not defined anywhere in the provided code. This means the program will fail to run correctly for any input because it lacks essential parts of the solution.

To be correct, the program should:
1. Read the input values for `n` and `m`.
2. Read the matrix of skyscraper heights.
3. Process the matrix to determine the relative heights for each row and column using `func_1`.
4. Use `func_2` to compute the minimum possible value of `x` for each intersection.
5. Print the results in the specified format.

Since the program is missing these crucial steps, it is incorrect.
