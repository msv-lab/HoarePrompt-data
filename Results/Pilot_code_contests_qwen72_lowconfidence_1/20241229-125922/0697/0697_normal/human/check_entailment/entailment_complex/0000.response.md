Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the preservation of the relative order of the skyscrapers in both the Eastern and Southern streets. The problem description requires that the heights of the skyscrapers be reassigned such that the maximum height is minimized while preserving the relative order of the heights in both streets. However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not ensure this.

### Issue with `func_2`:
- **Relative Order Preservation**: The function `func_2` calculates the difference between the heights of the skyscrapers at the intersection and adjusts the maximum height accordingly. However, this approach does not guarantee that the relative order of the heights in both streets is preserved.

### Example:
Consider the following input:
```
2 2
1 2
3 4
```

The expected output should be:
```
2 3
3 2
```

However, the current implementation might produce an incorrect result because it does not correctly handle the relative order preservation. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not ensure that the relative order of the heights in both streets is maintained.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the following steps should be taken:
1. **Sort and Rank Heights**: For each street, sort the heights and assign ranks to the skyscrapers based on their heights. This ensures that the relative order is preserved.
2. **Calculate Maximum Rank**: For each intersection, determine the maximum rank of the skyscrapers on the two streets. This will be the minimum possible value of `x` for that intersection.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code that ensures the relative order is preserved:

```python
from sys import stdin, stdout

def read_input():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    rows = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    return n, m, rows

def rank_heights(heights):
    unique_heights = sorted(set(heights))
    rank_map = {h: i + 1 for i, h in enumerate(unique_heights)}
    return [rank_map[h] for h in heights], len(unique_heights)

def solve(n, m, rows):
    columns = [[rows[i][j] for i in range(n)] for j in range(m)]
    rows_ranks = [rank_heights(row) for row in rows]
    columns_ranks = [rank_heights(column) for column in columns]

    answer_matrix = [[max(rows_ranks[i][0][j], columns_ranks[j][0][i]) for j in range(m)] for i in range(n)]
    return answer_matrix

def main():
    n, m, rows = read_input()
    answer_matrix = solve(n, m, rows)
    for row in answer_matrix:
        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Rank Heights**: The `rank_heights` function sorts the heights and assigns ranks to ensure the relative order is preserved.
2. **Solve Function**: The `solve` function computes the ranks for each row and column and then determines the maximum rank at each intersection.
3. **Main Function**: The `main` function reads the input, solves the problem, and prints the output.

This corrected approach ensures that the relative order of the heights is preserved in both the Eastern and Southern streets, and the maximum height is minimized for each intersection. Therefore, the original code is incorrect, and the corrected code should be used.
