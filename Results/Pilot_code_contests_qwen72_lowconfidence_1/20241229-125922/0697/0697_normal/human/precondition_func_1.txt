i and j are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively, such that 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m. Additionally, `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are precomputed lists where `rows_ordered[i]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street, and `columns_ordered[j]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street.
