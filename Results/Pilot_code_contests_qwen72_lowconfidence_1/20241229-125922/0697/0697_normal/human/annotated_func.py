    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `xs` is a sorted list of integers, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list where each element `ys[i]` is the position (1-based) of the original value of `xs[i]` among the unique original values in `xs`, `last_x` is the original value of the last element in `xs`, `j` is the number of unique original values in `xs` plus 1.
    return ys, j
    #The program returns `ys`, which is a list where each element `ys[i]` represents the 1-based position of the original value of `xs[i]` among the unique original values in `xs`, and `j`, which is the number of unique original values in `xs` plus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `xs` and returns a tuple `(ys, j)`. The list `ys` contains integers where each element `ys[i]` represents the 1-based position of the original value of `xs[i]` among the unique values in `xs`. The integer `j` is the number of unique values in `xs` plus 1. The function handles duplicates correctly by assigning the same position to equal values. If `xs` is empty, `ys` will be an empty list and `j` will be 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i and j are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively, such that 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m. Additionally, `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are precomputed lists where `rows_ordered[i]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street, and `columns_ordered[j]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street.
def func_2(i, j):
    if (rows_ordered[i][0][j] > columns_ordered[j][0][i]) :
        difference = rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]
        return max(rows_ordered[i][1], columns_ordered[j][1] + difference)
        #The program returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) plus the positive difference (`difference`). The difference is calculated as `rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`, where `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street and `columns_ordered[j][0][i]` is the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the j-th Southern street.
    else :
        difference = columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]
        return max(columns_ordered[j][1], rows_ordered[i][1] + difference)
        #The program returns the maximum value between `columns_ordered[j][1]` and `rows_ordered[i][1] + difference`, where `difference` is `columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]`. The height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is less than or equal to the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `columns_ordered[j][0][i]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `i` and `j`, which are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively. It returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street and the j-th Southern street, adjusted by the positive difference in their heights at the intersection (i, j).

Specifically:
- If the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][0][j]`) is greater than the height of the skyscraper at the same intersection on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][0][i]`), the function returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) plus the positive difference (`rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`).
- Otherwise, if the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street is less than or equal to the height of the skyscraper at the same intersection on the j-th Southern street, the function returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) plus the positive difference (`columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]`).

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `i` or `j` are out of bounds (i.e., `i >= n` or `j >= m`), the function will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access elements in `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` lists.
- If `rows_ordered` or `columns_ordered` are not properly initialized or contain invalid data (e.g., empty lists, non-tuple elements, or tuples with incorrect lengths), the function will raise a `TypeError` or `IndexError`.

The function assumes that `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are correctly precomputed and that the indices `i` and `j` are within valid ranges.
