The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `i` and `j`, which are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively. It returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street and the j-th Southern street, adjusted by the positive difference in their heights at the intersection (i, j).

Specifically:
- If the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][0][j]`) is greater than the height of the skyscraper at the same intersection on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][0][i]`), the function returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) plus the positive difference (`rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`).
- Otherwise, if the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street is less than or equal to the height of the skyscraper at the same intersection on the j-th Southern street, the function returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) plus the positive difference (`columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]`).

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `i` or `j` are out of bounds (i.e., `i >= n` or `j >= m`), the function will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access elements in `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` lists.
- If `rows_ordered` or `columns_ordered` are not properly initialized or contain invalid data (e.g., empty lists, non-tuple elements, or tuples with incorrect lengths), the function will raise a `TypeError` or `IndexError`.

The function assumes that `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are correctly precomputed and that the indices `i` and `j` are within valid ranges.
