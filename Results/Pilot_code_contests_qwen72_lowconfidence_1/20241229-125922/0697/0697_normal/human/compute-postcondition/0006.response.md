The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `i` and `j`, which are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively, with the constraints 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m. The function also utilizes two precomputed lists, `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered`, where `rows_ordered[i]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street, and `columns_ordered[j]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street.

**Case_1:** The function returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) plus the positive difference (`difference`). The difference is calculated as `rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`, where `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street and `columns_ordered[j][0][i]` is the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the j-th Southern street.

**Case_2:** The function returns the maximum value between `columns_ordered[j][1]` and `rows_ordered[i][1] + difference`, where `difference` is `columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]`. This case applies when the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is less than or equal to the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `columns_ordered[j][0][i]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `i` and `j`, and returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street and the j-th Southern street, adjusted by the positive difference in their heights at the intersection (i, j). In Case_1, the difference is `rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`, and in Case_2, the difference is `columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]`, with the condition that the height of the skyscraper at (i, j) in `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is less than or equal to the height in `columns_ordered[j][0][i]` for Case_2.**
