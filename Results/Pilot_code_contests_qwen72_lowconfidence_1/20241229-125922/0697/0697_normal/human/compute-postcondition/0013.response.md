Postcondition: ***`xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list with the first element as 0 if `x` equals `last_x` (which is `None`), or 1 if `x` does not equal `last_x`. `last_x` remains `None`, `j` is 0 if `x` equals `last_x`, or 1 if `x` does not equal `last_x`. `w` is the first element in `xs`, `x` is the original value of the first element in `xs`, and `i` is 0.***
