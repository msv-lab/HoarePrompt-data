To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element.
- Each element in `xs` is the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index.
- `ys` is a list with the first element as 0.
- `last_x` is equal to `x`.
- `j` is 0.
- `w` is the first element in `xs`.
- `x` is the original value of the first element in `xs`.
- `i` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for w in xs:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `xs`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `xs` after the current one.
2. **Current State**:
   - `w` is the first element in `xs`.
   - `i` is 0, indicating the first iteration.
   - `x` is the original value of the first element in `xs`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `w` will be set to the second element in `xs`.
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - The other variables (`xs`, `ys`, `last_x`, `j`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body (which is omitted).

### Adjusted State:
- `w` will be the second element in `xs`.
- `i` will be 1.
- `x` remains the original value of the first element in `xs` (since it is not updated in the loop condition).
- `last_x` remains the same as `x` (since it is not updated in the loop condition).
- `j` remains 0 (since it is not updated in the loop condition).
- `ys` remains a list with the first element as 0 (since it is not updated in the loop condition).

### Final State:
State: **`xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list with the first element as 0, `last_x` is equal to `x`, `j` is 0, `w` is the second element in `xs`, `x` is the original value of the first element in `xs`, and `i` is 1**.
