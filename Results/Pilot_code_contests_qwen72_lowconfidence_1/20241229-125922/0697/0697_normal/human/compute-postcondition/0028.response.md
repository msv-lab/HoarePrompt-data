The code snippet `ys[i] = j` updates the `i`-th element of the list `ys` with the value of `j`.

- `ys[i]` is updated from its initial value (which was 0) to the value of `j`.
- The value of `j` is 1.
- The value of `i` is 2.

Therefore, the second element (index 2) of `ys` is set to 1.

The rest of the variables (`xs`, `last_x`, `w`, `x`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list with the first element as 0 and the third element as 1, `last_x` is `x_1 + 0.001`, `j` is 1, `w` is the third element in `xs`, `x` is `x_2 + 0.002`, and `i` is 2.**
