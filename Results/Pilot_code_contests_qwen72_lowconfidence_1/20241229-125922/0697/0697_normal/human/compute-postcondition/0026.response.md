The value of `ys[i]` is updated to `j`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, `ys[2]` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list with the first element as 0 and `ys[2]` is 0, `last_x` is `x_1 + 0.001`, `j` is 0, `w` is the third element in `xs`, `x` is `x_2 + 0.002`, and `i` is 2.**
