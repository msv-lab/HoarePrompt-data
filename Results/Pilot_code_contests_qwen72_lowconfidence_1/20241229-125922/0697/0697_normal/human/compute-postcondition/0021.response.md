Postcondition: ***`xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list with the first element as 0, `last_x` is equal to `x_0`, `j` is 0, `w` is the second element in `xs`, `x` is `x_1 + 0.001`, and `i` is 1. If `x` equals `last_x`, `ys` remains [0, 0] and `j` remains 0. Otherwise, `ys` becomes [0, 1] and `j` is incremented to 1.***
