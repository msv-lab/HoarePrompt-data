To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index.
  - `ys` is a list with the first element as 0.
  - `last_x` is `x_1 + 0.001`.
  - `j` is 0.
  - `w` is the second element in `xs`.
  - `x` is `x_1 + 0.001`.
  - `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for w in xs:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `xs`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `w` was set to the second element in `xs`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `w` must be set to the next element in `xs`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `w` should be set to the third element in `xs`.
- `i` should be incremented by 1, as it typically tracks the iteration count.

### Updated State:
- `xs` remains the same: a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index.
- `ys` remains the same: a list with the first element as 0.
- `last_x` remains the same: `x_1 + 0.001`.
- `j` remains the same: 0.
- `w` is now the third element in `xs`.
- `x` remains the same: `x_1 + 0.001`.
- `i` is incremented by 1: `i` is 2.

### Final State:
State: **`xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list with the first element as 0, `last_x` is `x_1 + 0.001`, `j` is 0, `w` is the third element in `xs`, `x` is `x_1 + 0.001`, and `i` is 2.**
