The code snippet `i = w % 1000` assigns the remainder of `w` divided by 1000 to `i`. Given that `w` is the third element in `xs`, and each element in `xs` is calculated as the original value multiplied by 1000 plus its index, the remainder when `w` is divided by 1000 is the index of `w` in `xs`.

Since `w` is the third element, its index is 2. Therefore, `i` is set to 2.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list with the first element as 0, `last_x` is `x_1 + 0.001`, `j` is 0, `w` is the third element in `xs`, `x` is `x_2 + 0.002`, and `i` is 2.**
