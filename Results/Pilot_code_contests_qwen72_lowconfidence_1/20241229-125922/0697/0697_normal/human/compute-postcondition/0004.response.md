The code snippet calculates the difference between the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) as given by `columns_ordered[j][0][i]` and the height of the skyscraper at the same intersection as given by `rows_ordered[i][0][j]`. This difference is stored in the variable `difference`.

Given the initial state, the following are the details:
- `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices.
- `rows_ordered[i]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street.
- `columns_ordered[j]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street.
- The height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is less than or equal to the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `columns_ordered[j][0][i]`.

The calculation:
- `columns_ordered[j][0][i]` gives the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) from the Southern perspective.
- `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` gives the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) from the Eastern perspective.
- `difference` is the result of subtracting the height from the Eastern perspective from the height from the Southern perspective.

Since the height from the Southern perspective is always greater than or equal to the height from the Eastern perspective, `difference` will be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `difference` while keeping all other conditions unchanged.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m, `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are precomputed lists, `difference` is `columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]`, and the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is less than or equal to the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) in `columns_ordered[j][0][i]`.**
