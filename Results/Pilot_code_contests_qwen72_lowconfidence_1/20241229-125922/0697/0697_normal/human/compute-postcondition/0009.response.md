The code snippet `ys[i] = j` updates the value of `ys` at index `i` to `j`. Given the initial state:

- `xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index.
- `ys` is a list of zeros with the same length as `xs`.
- `last_x` is `None`.
- `j` is 0.
- `w` is the first element in `xs`.
- `x` is the original value of the first element in `xs`.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is not equal to `last_x`.

After executing the code snippet:

- `ys[0]` (the first element of `ys`) is now set to `0` (the value of `j`).

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list of zeros with the same length as `xs` except `ys[0]` which is 0, `last_x` is `None`, `j` is 0, `w` is the first element in `xs`, `x` is the original value of the first element in `xs`, `i` is 0, and `x` is not equal to `last_x`.**
