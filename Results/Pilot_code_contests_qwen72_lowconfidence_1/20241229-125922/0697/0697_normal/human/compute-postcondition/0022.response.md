The code snippet `last_x = x` updates the value of `last_x` to the current value of `x`. Given the initial state, `x` is defined as `x_1 + 0.001`. Therefore, `last_x` will now hold the value of `x_1 + 0.001`.

The rest of the variables (`xs`, `ys`, `j`, `w`, `i`) remain unchanged, as they are not modified by this code snippet. The condition about `ys` and `j` does not apply here since the code snippet only assigns a new value to `last_x`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list with the first element as 0, `last_x` is `x_1 + 0.001`, `j` is 0, `w` is the second element in `xs`, `x` is `x_1 + 0.001`, and `i` is 1.**
