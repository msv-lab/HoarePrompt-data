The code snippet calculates the difference between the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street and the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the j-th Southern street. The height of the skyscraper at (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street is given by `rows_ordered[i][0][j]`, and the height of the skyscraper at (i, j) on the j-th Southern street is given by `columns_ordered[j][0][i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively, such that 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m.
- `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are precomputed lists where `rows_ordered[i]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street, and `columns_ordered[j]` contains a tuple with the ordered heights and the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street.
- The height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street is greater than the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the j-th Southern street.

The impact of the code:
- `difference` is assigned the value `rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`.

Since the height of the skyscraper at (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street is greater than the height of the skyscraper at (i, j) on the j-th Southern street, `difference` will be a positive value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing the indices of the Eastern and Southern streets, respectively, such that 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m; `rows_ordered` and `columns_ordered` are precomputed lists; the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street is greater than the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the j-th Southern street; `difference` is `rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]` and is a positive value.**
