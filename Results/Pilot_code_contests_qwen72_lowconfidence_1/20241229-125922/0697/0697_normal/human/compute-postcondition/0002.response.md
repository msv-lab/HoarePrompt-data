Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the i-th Eastern street (`rows_ordered[i][1]`) and the sum of the maximum height of the skyscrapers on the j-th Southern street (`columns_ordered[j][1]`) plus the positive difference (`difference`). The difference is calculated as `rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]`, where `rows_ordered[i][0][j]` is the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the i-th Eastern street and `columns_ordered[j][0][i]` is the height of the skyscraper at the intersection (i, j) on the j-th Southern street.**
