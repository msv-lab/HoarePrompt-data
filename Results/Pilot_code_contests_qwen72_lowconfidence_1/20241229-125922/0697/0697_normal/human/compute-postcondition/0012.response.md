The code snippet `ys[i] = j` assigns the value of `j` (which is 1) to the element in the list `ys` at the index `i` (which is 0). This changes the first element of `ys` from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`xs` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, each element being the original value in `xs` multiplied by 1000 and added to its original index, `ys` is a list with the first element as 1 and the rest as zeros, `last_x` is `None`, `j` is 1, `w` is the first element in `xs`, `x` is the original value of the first element in `xs`, `i` is 0, and `x` is not equal to `last_x`**
