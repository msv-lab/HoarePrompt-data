Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing any number of elements of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' (with 'end' possibly removed). `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise ' '. `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`. `at_start` is False, and if `args` contains at least one element, the string representation of each element in `args` separated by `sep` has been written to `file`. The value of `'end'` from `kwargs` or `'\n'` has been written to `file`. Additionally, the key `'flush'` has been removed from `kwargs`, and its value was `True`.***
