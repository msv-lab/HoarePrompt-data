The code snippet modifies the second-to-last element of the `temp` list by setting it equal to the last element of the same list. This impacts the state of the `temp` list, while the other variables (`n`, `arr`, and `cost1`) remain unchanged.

- `n` remains a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `temp` is now a modified copy of `arr`, with its second-to-last element set to the value of its last element.
- `cost1` remains the minimum value between the original `cost1` and the value returned by `cost(temp)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a modified copy of `arr` where the second-to-last element is equal to the last element, `cost1` is the minimum value between the original `cost1` and the value returned by `cost(temp)`**.
