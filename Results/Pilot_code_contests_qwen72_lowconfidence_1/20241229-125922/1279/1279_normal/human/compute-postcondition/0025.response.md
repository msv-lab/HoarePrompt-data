The code `temp = list(arr)` creates a new list `temp` that is a copy of `arr`. This does not change the value of `n`, nor does it affect the original `arr`. However, this line overwrites the previous value of `temp`, which was a copy of `arr` with `temp[1]` set to `temp[0]`. The value of `cost1` remains unchanged because the code snippet provided does not modify it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr`, `cost1` is the minimum value between the original `cost1` and the value returned by `cost(temp)`**
