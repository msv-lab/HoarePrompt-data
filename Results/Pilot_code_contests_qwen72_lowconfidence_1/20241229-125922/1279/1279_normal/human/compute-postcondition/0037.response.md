The code snippet `cost1 = cost(temp)` assigns the result of the function `cost` applied to the list `temp` to the variable `cost1`. The value of `temp` is a copy of `arr` with the modification that `temp[0] = temp[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[0] = temp[1]`, `cost1` is the result of `cost(temp)`, and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
