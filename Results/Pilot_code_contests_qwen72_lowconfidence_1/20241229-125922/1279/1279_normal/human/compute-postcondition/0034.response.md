The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[-1]` equal to `temp[-2]`.
- `cost1` is `new_cost1` (the value returned by `func_4(cost1)`).
- The loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.

After executing the code snippet, the new state is:
- `n` remains a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- `temp` is no longer a valid reference to a copy of the original `arr` because `arr` has been reassigned.
- `cost1` remains `new_cost1` (the value returned by `func_4(cost1)`).
- The loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is no longer a valid reference to a copy of `arr`, `cost1` is `new_cost1` (the value returned by `func_4(cost1)`), and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
