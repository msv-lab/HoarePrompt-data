To address the given task, we need to consider the function `func_4(cost1)` and its impact on the state of the variables. Since the function `func_4` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we must infer its behavior based on the context. Typically, a function might modify the value of `cost1` or perform some operation that affects the state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[-1]` equal to `temp[-2]`
- `cost1` is the minimum value between the original `cost1` and the value returned by `cost(temp)`

Let's assume `func_4(cost1)` modifies `cost1` in some way. Without the exact definition of `func_4`, we can only generalize its effect. However, if `func_4` is designed to further process `cost1`, we can infer that it might return a new value for `cost1`.

For the sake of this example, let's assume `func_4(cost1)` returns a new value for `cost1` which is used to update the current `cost1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
   - `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[-1]` equal to `temp[-2]`
   - `cost1` is the minimum value between the original `cost1` and the value returned by `cost(temp)`

2. **Function Call**:
   - `func_4(cost1)` is called.
   - Assuming `func_4(cost1)` returns a new value for `cost1`, let's denote this new value as `new_cost1`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `cost1` is updated to `new_cost1`.
   - Other variables (`n`, `arr`, `temp`) remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[-1]` equal to `temp[-2]`
- `cost1` is `new_cost1` (the value returned by `func_4(cost1)`)

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[-1]` equal to `temp[-2]`, `cost1` is `new_cost1` (the value returned by `func_4(cost1)`)**
