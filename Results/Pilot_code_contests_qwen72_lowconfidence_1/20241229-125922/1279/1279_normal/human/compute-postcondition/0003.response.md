The values of `x` and `y` are updated according to the new assignments. `x` is now the old value of `y`, and `y` is the remainder of the old `x` divided by the old `y`.

Given:
- `x` is the old value of `y`
- `y` is the remainder of the old `x` divided by the old `y`

After executing the code:
- `x` is now the old value of `y`
- `y` is now the remainder of the old `x` divided by the old `y`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`x` is the old value of `y`, `y` is the remainder of the old `x` divided by the old `y`**
