Functionality: ** The function `func_4` prints the elements of a given tuple `args` to a specified file stream, separated by a customizable separator (`sep`), followed by a customizable end string (`end`). It supports flushing the stream if requested. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `end`, and `flush` if they are present. The function does not return any value. Here are the specific points about the function's behavior:

- **Input Parameters**:
  - `args`: A tuple of any number of elements of any type.
  - `kwargs`: A dictionary that can contain the following keys:
    - `sep` (default: ' '): A string used to separate the elements in `args` when printed.
    - `file` (default: `sys.stdout`): A stream object to which the elements are written.
    - `end` (default: '\n'): A string appended after the last element in `args`.
    - `flush` (default: `False`): A boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream after writing.

- **Output**:
  - The function does not return any value.

- **Final State**:
  - The elements of `args` are printed to the specified `file` stream, separated by `sep` and followed by `end`.
  - If `flush` is `True`, the buffer of `file` is flushed.
  - The `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the keys `sep`, `end`, and `flush` if they were present.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file`.
  - If `sep` is not provided in `kwargs`, it defaults to a single space.
  - If `file` is not provided in `kwargs`, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.
  - If `end` is not provided in `kwargs`, it defaults to a newline character.
  - If `flush` is not provided in `kwargs`, it defaults to `False`.

- **Missing Functionality**:
  - The function does not handle the case where `file` is not a valid stream object, which could lead to errors if an invalid file object is passed.
  - The function does not check if `file` has a `write` method, which could also lead to errors if an object without a `write` method is passed. **
