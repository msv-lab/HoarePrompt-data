The function `func_4(cost1)` is called with `cost1` as its argument. The specifics of what `func_4` does are not provided in the code snippet, so we cannot determine the exact changes to the state. However, since `func_4` is being passed `cost1`, it is likely that `cost1` may be modified or used within the function. Without additional details about `func_4`, we assume that it does not modify global variables or return any values.

Given this, the only thing we can definitively say is that the function `func_4` has been called with `cost1` as its argument, and no other changes to the state can be determined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[-1]` now equal to `temp[-2]`, `cost1` is the minimum of the original `cost1` and `cost(temp)`, and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
