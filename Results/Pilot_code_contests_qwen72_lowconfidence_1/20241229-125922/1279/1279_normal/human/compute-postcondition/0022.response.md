Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing any number of elements of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' (with 'end' possibly removed), `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False. If `args` contains at least one element, the string representation of each element in `args` separated by `sep` has been written to `file`, and the value of `'end'` from `kwargs` or `'\n'` has been written to `file`. If `'flush'` is `True` in `kwargs`, the key `'flush'` has been removed from `kwargs`, and the buffer of `file` has been flushed.***
