According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `y` evaluates to a truthy value. Since `y` is an integer and is specified as not being zero, it already meets the condition to enter the loop because any non-zero integer in Python evaluates to `True`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **x and y are integers, and y is not zero**
