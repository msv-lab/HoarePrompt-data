The code snippet provided is:

```
at_start = False
```

Since `at_start` was already set to `False` in the initial state, this line does not change the value of `at_start`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and the string representation of the first element of `args` followed by `sep` and then the string representation of the second element of `args` have been written to `file`.**
