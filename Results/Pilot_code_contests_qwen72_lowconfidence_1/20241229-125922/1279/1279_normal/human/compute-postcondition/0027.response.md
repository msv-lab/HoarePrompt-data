The value of `cost1` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the value returned by the function `cost(temp)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a modified copy of `arr` where the second-to-last element is equal to the last element, `cost1` is the minimum value between the original `cost1` and the value returned by `cost(temp)`**
