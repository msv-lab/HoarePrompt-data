`temp` is assigned a new list that is a copy of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr`, `cost1` is `new_cost1` (the value returned by `func_4(cost1)`), and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.
