To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where \(-5 \cdot 10^8 \leq arr[i] \leq 5 \cdot 10^8\).

### Loop Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    temp = list(arr)
    temp[0] = temp[1]
    cost1 = cost(temp)
    temp = list(arr)
    temp[1] = temp[0]
    cost1 = min(cost1, cost(temp))
    temp = list(arr)
    temp[-2] = temp[-1]
    cost1 = min(cost1, cost(temp))
    temp = list(arr)
    temp[-1] = temp[-2]
    cost1 = min(cost1, cost(temp))
    func_4(cost1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for a number of times specified by the user input.
   - For each iteration:
     - `n` and `arr` are re-read from user input.
     - `temp` is initialized as a copy of `arr`.
     - Four modifications are made to `temp`:
       - `temp[0] = temp[1]`
       - `temp[1] = temp[0]`
       - `temp[-2] = temp[-1]`
       - `temp[-1] = temp[-2]`
     - After each modification, `cost1` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the result of `cost(temp)`.
     - Finally, `func_4(cost1)` is called.

2. **Impact of Each Iteration**:
   - `n` and `arr` are re-initialized for each iteration.
   - `temp` is a copy of `arr` and is modified in four different ways.
   - `cost1` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the cost of the modified `temp`.
   - `func_4(cost1)` is called, which may modify `cost1` or perform some other operation, but its exact behavior is unknown.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - The number of iterations is determined by the initial user input.
   - After all iterations, `n` and `arr` will be the values from the last iteration.
   - `cost1` will be the minimum value of `cost(temp)` across all iterations and modifications.
   - `func_4(cost1)` will have been called for each iteration, potentially modifying `cost1` in some way.

### Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where \(-5 \cdot 10^8 \leq arr[i] \leq 5 \cdot 10^8\).
- `cost1` is the minimum value of the cost function applied to the modified versions of `arr` across all iterations.
- `func_4(cost1)` has been called for each iteration, and the final state of `cost1` depends on the behavior of `func_4`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where \(-5 \cdot 10^8 \leq arr[i] \leq 5 \cdot 10^8\), `cost1` is the minimum value of the cost function applied to the modified versions of `arr` across all iterations, and `func_4(cost1)` has been called for each iteration.**
