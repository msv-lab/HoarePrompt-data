The value of `n` is updated to the integer value obtained from the user input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `n` was already a positive integer within a certain range, the new value of `n` should also be a positive integer within the same range.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) (updated from user input), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[-1]` equal to `temp[-2]`, `cost1` is `new_cost1` (the value returned by `func_4(cost1)`), and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
