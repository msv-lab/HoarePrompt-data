To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[-1]` equal to `temp[-2]`.
- `cost1` is `new_cost1` (the value returned by `func_4(cost1)`).

### Loop Structure:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute a number of times specified by `int(input())`. This means the loop will run as long as there are iterations left based on the user input.
2. **State Variables**:
   - `n`: The value of `n` does not change with each iteration of the loop.
   - `arr`: The value of `arr` does not change with each iteration of the loop.
   - `temp`: The value of `temp` does not change with each iteration of the loop.
   - `cost1`: The value of `cost1` is updated to `new_cost1` at the end of each iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.
- The value of `cost1` is updated to `new_cost1` at the end of each iteration.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- The loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.
- The value of `cost1` will be `new_cost1` from the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[-1]` equal to `temp[-2]`, `cost1` is `new_cost1` (the value returned by `func_4(cost1)`), and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
