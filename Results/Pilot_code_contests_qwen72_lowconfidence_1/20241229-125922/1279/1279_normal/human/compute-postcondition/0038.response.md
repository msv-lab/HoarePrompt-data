The code snippet `temp = list(arr)` creates a new list `temp` that is a shallow copy of the list `arr`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `arr`, `cost1`, or the loop condition. However, the specific modification of `temp[0] = temp[1]` mentioned in the initial state is not part of this code snippet, so `temp` remains a direct copy of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a list that is a copy of `arr`, `cost1` is the result of `cost(temp)`, and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
