To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `args` is a tuple containing at least two elements.
- `x` is the second element of `args`.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush'.
- `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise ' '.
- `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is False.
- The string representation of the first element of `args` followed by `sep` and then the string representation of the second element of `args` have been written to `file`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `args`. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `args` to process.
2. **Current State**:
   - `x` is currently the second element of `args`.
   - The first two elements of `args` have been processed and their string representations have been written to `file`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be the third element of `args`.
   - The third element of `args` must exist for the loop to proceed.
   - The string representation of the third element of `args` will be written to `file` in the next iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `args` must still be a tuple containing at least three elements (since the third element needs to be processed).
- `x` should now be the third element of `args`.
- The string representation of the first element of `args` followed by `sep`, then the string representation of the second element of `args`, and then `sep` and the string representation of the third element of `args` will be written to `file`.

### Final State:
State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and the string representation of the first element of `args` followed by `sep`, then the string representation of the second element of `args`, and then `sep` and the string representation of the third element of `args` have been written to `file`.**
