The code snippet `x, y = y, x % y` performs two operations:
1. It assigns the value of `y` to `x`.
2. It assigns the remainder of `x` divided by `y` to `y`.

Given the initial state where `x` and `y` are integers, and `y` is not zero, the output state will reflect these changes.

- The new value of `x` is the old value of `y`.
- The new value of `y` is the remainder of the old `x` divided by the old `y`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` is the old value of `y`, `y` is the remainder of the old `x` divided by the old `y`**.
