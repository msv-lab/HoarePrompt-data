You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing any number of elements of any type, and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. The value for 'sep' is a string used to separate the elements in args when printed, defaulting to a single space. The value for 'file' is a stream object, defaulting to sys.stdout. The value for 'end' is a string appended after the last element in args, defaulting to a newline character. The value for 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, defaulting to False.
def func_4():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing any number of elements of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and if `args` contains at least one element, the string representation of each element in `args` separated by `sep` has been written to `file`. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple containing any number of elements of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' (with 'end' possibly removed), `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False. If `args` contains at least one element, the string representation of each element in `args` separated by `sep` has been written to `file`, and the value of `'end'` from `kwargs` or `'\n'` has been written to `file`. If `'flush'` is `True` in `kwargs`, the key `'flush'` has been removed from `kwargs`, and the buffer of `file` has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts any number of positional arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
