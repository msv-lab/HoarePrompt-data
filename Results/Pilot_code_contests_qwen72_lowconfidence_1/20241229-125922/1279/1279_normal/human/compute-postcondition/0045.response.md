The last element of `temp` is set to the second-to-last element of `temp`. This operation modifies the last element of the list `temp` but does not affect the other elements of `temp` or the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[-1]` now equal to `temp[-2]`, `cost1` is the minimum of the original `cost1` and `cost(temp)`, and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
