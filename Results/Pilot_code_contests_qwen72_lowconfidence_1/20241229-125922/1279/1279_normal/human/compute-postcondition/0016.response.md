The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`.

- `x` is the third element of `args`.
- The initial state specifies that the string representation of the first two elements of `args` followed by `sep` and then the string representation of the third element of `args` (which is `x`) have already been written to `file`.
- If `not at_start` is true, an additional `sep` is written to `file` before this snippet.

Since the code only appends the string representation of `x` to `file`, the values of the variables in the initial state remain unchanged except for the content written to `file`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and the string representation of the first element of `args` followed by `sep`, then the string representation of the second element of `args`, then `sep` and the string representation of the third element of `args` have been written to `file`. Additionally, the string representation of `x` has been written to `file`.**
