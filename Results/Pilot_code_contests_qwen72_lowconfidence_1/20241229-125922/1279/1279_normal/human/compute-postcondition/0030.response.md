The value of `cost1` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the value returned by the function `cost(temp)`. The `temp` list is a copy of `arr` with its last element set to the second-to-last element of `arr`. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `temp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[-1]` equal to `temp[-2]`, `cost1` is the minimum value between the original `cost1` and the value returned by `cost(temp)`**
