The function `func_5` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where both `x` and `y` are integers, and `y` is not zero. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`.

However, the provided output statement seems to contradict the parameter constraint that `y` is not zero. Given the correct constraint that `y` is not zero, the function should return the GCD of `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where both are integers and `y` is not zero. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.**
