The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` and `arr`. `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies -5 ⋅ 10^8 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^8. The function returns a value based on the processing of these parameters.

However, since the specific output logic is not provided, I will assume a generic return statement based on common practices in such functions, which often involve some form of computation or analysis of the array elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` of length `n`, where each element in `arr` is within the range -5 ⋅ 10^8 to 5 ⋅ 10^8. It returns a result based on the processing of `arr`.**

If you can provide more specific details about what the function should return (e.g., the sum of the array, the maximum value, etc.), I can refine this description further.
