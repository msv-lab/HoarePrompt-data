The value of `cost1` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cost(temp)`. Since the exact values of `cost1` and `cost(temp)` are not specified, we can only say that `cost1` will be the smaller of these two values. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a list where the second-to-last element is now equal to the last element, `cost1` is the minimum of the original `cost1` and `cost(temp)`, and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
