The code snippet `temp[-1] = temp[-2]` modifies the last element of the `temp` list to be equal to the second-to-last element of the `temp` list. Since `temp` is a shallow copy of `arr`, this modification only affects `temp` and does not change `arr`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `temp[-1]` is now equal to `temp[-2]`.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, and `cost1` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[-1]` equal to `temp[-2]`, `cost1` is the minimum value between the original `cost1` and the value returned by `cost(temp)`**.
