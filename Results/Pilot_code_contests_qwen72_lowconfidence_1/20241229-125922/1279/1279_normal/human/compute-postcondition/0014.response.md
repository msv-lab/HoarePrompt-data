The `file.write(sep)` command writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. This does not change the values of `args`, `x`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, or `at_start`. However, the content written to `file` now includes an additional `sep` after the previous content.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple containing at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and the string representation of the first element of `args` followed by `sep`, then the string representation of the second element of `args`, then `sep` and the string representation of the third element of `args`, followed by another `sep` have been written to `file`.**
