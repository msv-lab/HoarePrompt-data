The value of `temp[0]` is updated to be equal to `temp[1]`. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `cost1`) remain unchanged. The loop condition and the state of `temp` beyond the first two elements also remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr` with `temp[0] = temp[1]`, `cost1` is `new_cost1` (the value returned by `func_4(cost1)`), and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
