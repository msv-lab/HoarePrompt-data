Functionality: ** The function `func_3` reads multiple sets of inputs, each set consisting of a positive integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)) and a list of `n` integers `arr` (where each element is within the range \(-5 \cdot 10^8 \leq arr[i] \leq 5 \cdot 10^8\)). For each set of inputs, it calculates the minimum cost of modifying the list `arr` by swapping adjacent elements at the start and end of the list. Specifically, it considers four modifications: swapping the first two elements, swapping the last two elements, and setting the first or last element to its adjacent neighbor. It then calls `func_4` with the minimum cost calculated for each modification. After processing all input sets, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program includes the number of test cases processed, the values of `n` and `arr` for each test case, and the minimum cost for each test case, which has been passed to `func_4`. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:**
- If the input list `arr` has only two elements (`n = 2`), the function will still attempt to swap elements, but the modifications will be redundant since the list can only have two possible configurations.
- The function does not handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., non-integer inputs or inputs outside the specified ranges).
- The function does not store or return the results of the minimum costs; it only passes them to `func_4`.
- The function assumes that the `cost` function and `func_4` are defined elsewhere and work as expected. If these functions are not defined or do not behave as intended, the behavior of `func_3` will be affected.
