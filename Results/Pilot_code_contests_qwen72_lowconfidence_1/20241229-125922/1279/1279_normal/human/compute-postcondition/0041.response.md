The code `temp = list(arr)` creates a new list `temp` that is a copy of `arr`. This means that `temp` now contains the same elements as `arr`, but it is a distinct list object. The initial condition that `temp[1] = temp[0]` is no longer relevant because this assignment is not part of the current code snippet. The other variables (`n`, `cost1`) and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a list that is a copy of `arr`, `cost1` is the minimum of the original `cost1` and `cost(temp)`, and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
