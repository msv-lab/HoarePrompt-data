The code `x, y = y, x % y` swaps the value of `x` with the current value of `y` and updates `y` to be the remainder of the old `x` divided by the old `y`.

- The old value of `x` was the old value of `y`.
- The old value of `y` was the remainder of the old `x` divided by the old `y`.

After executing the code:
- `x` now holds the old value of `y`.
- `y` now holds the remainder of the old `x` (which was the old value of `y`) divided by the old `y` (which was the remainder of the old `x` divided by the old `y`).

Therefore, the Output State is: **`x` is the old value of `y`, `y` is the remainder of the old `y` divided by the remainder of the old `x` divided by the old `y`.**
