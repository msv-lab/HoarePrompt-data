The value of `temp[1]` is updated to be the same as `temp[0]`. This means that the second element of the list `temp` is now the same as the first element. The states of `n`, `arr`, and `cost1` remain unchanged, and the condition for further loop execution (based on user input) also remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a list that is a copy of `arr` with `temp[1] = temp[0]`, `cost1` is the result of `cost(temp)`, and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
