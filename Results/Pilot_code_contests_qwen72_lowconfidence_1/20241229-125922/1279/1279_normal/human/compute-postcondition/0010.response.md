Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and the string representation of the first element of `args` has been written to `file`. If `at_start` is False, the string representation of `sep` has also been written to `file`.***
