The value of `cost1` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and the result of `cost(temp)`. Since the exact values of `cost1` and the result of `cost(temp)` are not specified, we can only state that `cost1` is now the lesser of these two values. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a list that is a copy of `arr` with `temp[1] = temp[0]`, `cost1` is the minimum of the original `cost1` and `cost(temp)`, and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
