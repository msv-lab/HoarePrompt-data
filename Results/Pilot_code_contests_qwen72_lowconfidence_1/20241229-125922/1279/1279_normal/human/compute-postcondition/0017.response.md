The line of code `at_start = False` sets the variable `at_start` to `False`. Since `at_start` was already `False` in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and the string representation of the first element of `args` followed by `sep`, then the string representation of the second element of `args`, then `sep` and the string representation of the third element of `args` have been written to `file`. Additionally, the string representation of `x` has been written to `file`.**
