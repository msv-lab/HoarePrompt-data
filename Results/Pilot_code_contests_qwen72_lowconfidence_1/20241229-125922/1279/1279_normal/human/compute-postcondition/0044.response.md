The code snippet `temp = list(arr)` creates a new list `temp` that is a copy of the list `arr`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `arr`, `cost1`, or the condition for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr`, `cost1` is the minimum of the original `cost1` and `cost(temp)`, and the loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.**
