The line `temp = list(arr)` creates a new list `temp` that is a shallow copy of the list `arr`. This operation does not modify the original `arr`, and since no other operations are performed, the values of `n`, `arr`, and `cost1` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is a copy of `arr`, `cost1` is the minimum value between the original `cost1` and the value returned by `cost(temp)`**.
