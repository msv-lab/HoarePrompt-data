The function `func_3` reads multiple sets of inputs, each set consisting of a positive integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)) and a list of `n` integers `arr` (where each element is within the range \(-5 \cdot 10^8 \leq arr[i] \leq 5 \cdot 10^8\)). For each set of inputs, it calculates the minimum cost of modifying the list `arr` by swapping adjacent elements at the start and end of the list. Specifically, it considers four modifications: swapping the first two elements, swapping the last two elements, and setting the first or last element to its adjacent neighbor. It then calls `func_4` with the minimum cost calculated for each modification. After processing all input sets, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program includes the number of test cases processed, the values of `n` and `arr` for each test case, and the minimum cost for each test case, which has been passed to `func_4`.
