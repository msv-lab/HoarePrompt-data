The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a set containing all unique divisors of `n`, including 1 and `n` itself. The function correctly identifies and includes all divisors of `n`, ensuring no duplicates are present in the returned set. It handles the case where `n` is 1 by returning the set `{1}`. The function assumes `n` is always a positive integer and does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs.
