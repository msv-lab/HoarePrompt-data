The function `cost` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive pairs of elements in the list. The input list `arr` remains unchanged after the function call. The function handles lists of length 2 up to 2 ⋅ 10^5, with each element in the range -5 ⋅ 10^8 to 5 ⋅ 10^8. The function does not handle empty lists or lists with a single element, which would result in a return value of 0 in those cases.
