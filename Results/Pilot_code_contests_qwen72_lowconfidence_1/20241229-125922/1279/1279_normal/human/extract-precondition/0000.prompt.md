You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Gildong has an interesting machine that has an array a with n integers. The machine supports two kinds of operations:

  1. Increase all elements of a suffix of the array by 1. 
  2. Decrease all elements of a suffix of the array by 1. 



A suffix is a subsegment (contiguous elements) of the array that contains a_n. In other words, for all i where a_i is included in the subsegment, all a_j's where i < j ≤ n must also be included in the subsegment.

Gildong wants to make all elements of a equal — he will always do so using the minimum number of operations necessary. To make his life even easier, before Gildong starts using the machine, you have the option of changing one of the integers in the array to any other integer. You are allowed to leave the array unchanged. You want to minimize the number of operations Gildong performs. With your help, what is the minimum number of operations Gildong will perform?

Note that even if you change one of the integers in the array, you should not count that as one of the operations because Gildong did not perform it.

Input

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of elements of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers. The i-th integer is a_i (-5 ⋅ 10^8 ≤ a_i ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^8).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n in all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations Gildong has to perform in order to make all elements of the array equal.

Note

In the first case, all elements of the array are already equal. Therefore, we do not change any integer and Gildong will perform zero operations.

In the second case, we can set a_3 to be 0, so that the array becomes [-1,0,0]. Now Gildong can use the 2-nd operation once on the suffix starting at a_2, which means a_2 and a_3 are decreased by 1, making all elements of the array -1.

In the third case, we can set a_1 to 96, so that the array becomes [96,96,97,95]. Now Gildong needs to: 

  * Use the 2-nd operation on the suffix starting at a_3 once, making the array [96,96,96,94]. 
  * Use the 1-st operation on the suffix starting at a_4 2 times, making the array [96,96,96,96]. 



In the fourth case, we can change the array into [-3,-3,-2,1]. Now Gildong needs to: 

  * Use the 2-nd operation on the suffix starting at a_4 3 times, making the array [-3,-3,-2,-2]. 
  * Use the 2-nd operation on the suffix starting at a_3 once, making the array [-3,-3,-3,-3]. 
Program:
```
def func_5(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
```
