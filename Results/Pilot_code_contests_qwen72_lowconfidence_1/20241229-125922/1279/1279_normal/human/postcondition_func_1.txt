The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list of prime numbers less than `n`. It initializes a list `arr` of length `n` with all elements set to `True`. It then iterates through the list, marking multiples of each prime number (starting from 2) as `False`. After the sieving process, it collects the indices of the `True` values in `arr` into a list `primes`, which represents the prime numbers. The function returns this list `primes`. The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, `arr` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices corresponding to non-prime numbers are `False`, and `primes` is a list of integers representing the prime numbers less than `n`. Edge cases include when `n` is 1 or 2; for `n = 1`, the function returns an empty list, and for `n = 2`, the function returns `[2]`.
