You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Gildong has an interesting machine that has an array a with n integers. The machine supports two kinds of operations:

  1. Increase all elements of a suffix of the array by 1. 
  2. Decrease all elements of a suffix of the array by 1. 



A suffix is a subsegment (contiguous elements) of the array that contains a_n. In other words, for all i where a_i is included in the subsegment, all a_j's where i < j ≤ n must also be included in the subsegment.

Gildong wants to make all elements of a equal — he will always do so using the minimum number of operations necessary. To make his life even easier, before Gildong starts using the machine, you have the option of changing one of the integers in the array to any other integer. You are allowed to leave the array unchanged. You want to minimize the number of operations Gildong performs. With your help, what is the minimum number of operations Gildong will perform?

Note that even if you change one of the integers in the array, you should not count that as one of the operations because Gildong did not perform it.

Input

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of elements of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers. The i-th integer is a_i (-5 ⋅ 10^8 ≤ a_i ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^8).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n in all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations Gildong has to perform in order to make all elements of the array equal.

Note

In the first case, all elements of the array are already equal. Therefore, we do not change any integer and Gildong will perform zero operations.

In the second case, we can set a_3 to be 0, so that the array becomes [-1,0,0]. Now Gildong can use the 2-nd operation once on the suffix starting at a_2, which means a_2 and a_3 are decreased by 1, making all elements of the array -1.

In the third case, we can set a_1 to 96, so that the array becomes [96,96,97,95]. Now Gildong needs to: 

  * Use the 2-nd operation on the suffix starting at a_3 once, making the array [96,96,96,94]. 
  * Use the 1-st operation on the suffix starting at a_4 2 times, making the array [96,96,96,96]. 



In the fourth case, we can change the array into [-3,-3,-2,1]. Now Gildong needs to: 

  * Use the 2-nd operation on the suffix starting at a_4 3 times, making the array [-3,-3,-2,-2]. 
  * Use the 2-nd operation on the suffix starting at a_3 once, making the array [-3,-3,-3,-3].

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are a few key points and a specific case where the program fails:

1. **Relevant Functions Not Defined**: The function `func_3` calls a function `cost` which is defined but is not used in the context of the problem. The actual logic for determining the minimum number of operations is not implemented correctly.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimizing Operations**: The program attempts to change only the first, second, second last, and last elements of the array. However, this approach does not consider all possible changes to minimize the number of operations. For example, changing any element in the middle of the array might result in fewer operations.

3. **Specific Case Failure**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   4
   1 2 3 4
   ```
   The optimal solution here would be to change the first element to 2, resulting in the array `[2, 2, 3, 4]`. The minimum number of operations required is 3:
   - Increase the suffix starting at index 2 by 1: `[2, 2, 4, 4]`
   - Increase the suffix starting at index 3 by 1: `[2, 2, 4, 5]`
   - Decrease the suffix starting at index 3 by 1: `[2, 2, 4, 4]`

   However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly because it only considers changing the first, second, second last, and last elements, which may not always yield the minimum number of operations.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 6 : The function `func_5` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, where `y` is guaranteed to be non-zero. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function concludes, the variable `y` is 0, and the variable `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The returned value is the GCD, which is always a positive integer. Edge cases such as negative inputs are handled correctly, as the GCD computation is based on the Euclidean algorithm, which works regardless of the sign of the inputs.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
