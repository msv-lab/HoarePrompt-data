Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_3` only considers a limited set of modifications to the array `arr` by swapping adjacent elements at the start and end of the list. However, the problem description requires considering the option of changing any single element in the array to any other integer, not just adjacent swaps. This limitation means that the program might miss the optimal solution in some cases.

For example, consider the input array `[1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 1]`. The program only checks the following modifications:
- Swapping the first two elements: `[4, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1]`
- Swapping the last two elements: `[1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4]`
- Setting the first element to the second: `[4, 4, 3, 2, 4, 1]`
- Setting the last element to the second-to-last: `[1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 4]`

However, the optimal solution might involve changing a different element, such as changing the third element to 4, resulting in the array `[1, 4, 4, 2, 4, 1]`, which would require fewer operations to make all elements equal.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
