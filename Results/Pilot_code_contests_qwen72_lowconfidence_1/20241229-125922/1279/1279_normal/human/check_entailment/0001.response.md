Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are a few key points and a specific case where the program fails:

1. **Relevant Functions Not Defined**: The function `func_3` calls a function `cost` which is defined but is not used in the context of the problem. The actual logic for determining the minimum number of operations is not implemented correctly.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimizing Operations**: The program attempts to change only the first, second, second last, and last elements of the array. However, this approach does not consider all possible changes to minimize the number of operations. For example, changing any element in the middle of the array might result in fewer operations.

3. **Specific Case Failure**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   4
   1 2 3 4
   ```
   The optimal solution here would be to change the first element to 2, resulting in the array `[2, 2, 3, 4]`. The minimum number of operations required is 3:
   - Increase the suffix starting at index 2 by 1: `[2, 2, 4, 4]`
   - Increase the suffix starting at index 3 by 1: `[2, 2, 4, 5]`
   - Decrease the suffix starting at index 3 by 1: `[2, 2, 4, 4]`

   However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly because it only considers changing the first, second, second last, and last elements, which may not always yield the minimum number of operations.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
