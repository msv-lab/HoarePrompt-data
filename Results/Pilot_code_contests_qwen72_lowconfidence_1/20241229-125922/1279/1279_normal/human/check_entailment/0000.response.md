Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the approach used in `func_3` only considers changing the first or last two elements of the array, which may not always lead to the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The current implementation in `func_3` will only consider the following changes:
- Change `arr[0]` to `arr[1]`: `[2, 2, 3, 4]`
- Change `arr[1]` to `arr[0]`: `[1, 1, 3, 4]`
- Change `arr[-2]` to `arr[-1]`: `[1, 2, 4, 4]`
- Change `arr[-1]` to `arr[-2]`: `[1, 2, 3, 3]`

The costs calculated for these changes are:
- `[2, 2, 3, 4]`: `|2-2| + |3-2| + |4-3| = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`
- `[1, 1, 3, 4]`: `|1-1| + |3-1| + |4-3| = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3`
- `[1, 2, 4, 4]`: `|2-1| + |4-2| + |4-4| = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3`
- `[1, 2, 3, 3]`: `|2-1| + |3-2| + |3-3| = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2`

The minimum cost found by the current implementation is 2. However, the optimal solution would be to change `arr[1]` to 2 and then perform the following operations:
- Decrease the suffix starting at index 2 by 1: `[1, 2, 2, 3]`
- Decrease the suffix starting at index 3 by 1: `[1, 2, 2, 2]`

This results in a total of 2 operations, but the optimal solution should actually be 1 operation by changing `arr[1]` to 2 and then performing a single operation to make all elements equal.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
