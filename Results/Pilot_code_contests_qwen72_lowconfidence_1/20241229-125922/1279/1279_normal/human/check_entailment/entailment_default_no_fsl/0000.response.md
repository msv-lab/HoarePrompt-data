Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the approach taken in `func_3` only considers swapping the first two elements, the last two elements, and setting the first or last element to its adjacent neighbor. This approach is limited and does not consider all possible ways to change one element in the array to minimize the number of operations.

### Issues:
1. **Limited Modifications**: The code only considers a few specific modifications (swapping the first two elements, the last two elements, and setting the first or last element to its adjacent neighbor). However, the problem statement allows changing any single element to any other integer, which could potentially lead to a lower cost.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation in `func_3` is based on a limited set of modifications, which may not always result in the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The current solution would only consider:
- Swapping the first two elements: `[2, 1, 3, 4]`
- Swapping the last two elements: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`
- Setting the first element to the second: `[2, 2, 3, 4]`
- Setting the last element to the second-to-last: `[1, 2, 3, 3]`

However, the optimal solution would be to set the second element to 2, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 2, 2]`, which requires only 1 operation (decreasing the last element by 1).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not consider all possible modifications to the array, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case, and the answer is **False**.
