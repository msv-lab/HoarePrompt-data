You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Gildong has an interesting machine that has an array a with n integers. The machine supports two kinds of operations:

  1. Increase all elements of a suffix of the array by 1. 
  2. Decrease all elements of a suffix of the array by 1. 



A suffix is a subsegment (contiguous elements) of the array that contains a_n. In other words, for all i where a_i is included in the subsegment, all a_j's where i < j ≤ n must also be included in the subsegment.

Gildong wants to make all elements of a equal — he will always do so using the minimum number of operations necessary. To make his life even easier, before Gildong starts using the machine, you have the option of changing one of the integers in the array to any other integer. You are allowed to leave the array unchanged. You want to minimize the number of operations Gildong performs. With your help, what is the minimum number of operations Gildong will perform?

Note that even if you change one of the integers in the array, you should not count that as one of the operations because Gildong did not perform it.

Input

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of elements of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers. The i-th integer is a_i (-5 ⋅ 10^8 ≤ a_i ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^8).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n in all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations Gildong has to perform in order to make all elements of the array equal.

Note

In the first case, all elements of the array are already equal. Therefore, we do not change any integer and Gildong will perform zero operations.

In the second case, we can set a_3 to be 0, so that the array becomes [-1,0,0]. Now Gildong can use the 2-nd operation once on the suffix starting at a_2, which means a_2 and a_3 are decreased by 1, making all elements of the array -1.

In the third case, we can set a_1 to 96, so that the array becomes [96,96,97,95]. Now Gildong needs to: 

  * Use the 2-nd operation on the suffix starting at a_3 once, making the array [96,96,96,94]. 
  * Use the 1-st operation on the suffix starting at a_4 2 times, making the array [96,96,96,96]. 



In the fourth case, we can change the array into [-3,-3,-2,1]. Now Gildong needs to: 

  * Use the 2-nd operation on the suffix starting at a_4 3 times, making the array [-3,-3,-2,-2]. 
  * Use the 2-nd operation on the suffix starting at a_3 once, making the array [-3,-3,-3,-3].

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a set containing all unique divisors of `n`, including 1 and `n` itself. The function correctly identifies and includes all divisors of `n`, ensuring no duplicates are present in the returned set. It handles the case where `n` is 1 by returning the set `{1}`. The function assumes `n` is always a positive integer and does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs.

''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list of prime numbers less than `n`. It initializes a list `arr` of length `n` with all elements set to `True`. It then iterates through the list, marking multiples of each prime number (starting from 2) as `False`. After the sieving process, it collects the indices of the `True` values in `arr` into a list `primes`, which represents the prime numbers. The function returns this list `primes`. The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, `arr` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices corresponding to non-prime numbers are `False`, and `primes` is a list of integers representing the prime numbers less than `n`. Edge cases include when `n` is 1 or 2; for `n = 1`, the function returns an empty list, and for `n = 2`, the function returns `[2]`.

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads multiple sets of inputs, each set consisting of a positive integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)) and a list of `n` integers `arr` (where each element is within the range \(-5 \cdot 10^8 \leq arr[i] \leq 5 \cdot 10^8\)). For each set of inputs, it calculates the minimum cost of modifying the list `arr` by swapping adjacent elements at the start and end of the list. Specifically, it considers four modifications: swapping the first two elements, swapping the last two elements, and setting the first or last element to its adjacent neighbor. It then calls `func_4` with the minimum cost calculated for each modification. After processing all input sets, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program includes the number of test cases processed, the values of `n` and `arr` for each test case, and the minimum cost for each test case, which has been passed to `func_4`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:

def cost(arr):
    cst = 0

    return cst
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `cost` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive pairs of elements in the list. The input list `arr` remains unchanged after the function call. The function handles lists of length 2 up to 2 ⋅ 10^5, with each element in the range -5 ⋅ 10^8 to 5 ⋅ 10^8. The function does not handle empty lists or lists with a single element, which would result in a return value of 0 in those cases.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(*args, **kwargs):
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))

''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_4` prints the elements of a given tuple `args` to a specified file stream, separated by a customizable separator (`sep`), followed by a customizable end string (`end`). It supports flushing the stream if requested. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `end`, and `flush` if they are present. The function does not return any value. Here are the specific points about the function's behavior:

Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_5` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, where `y` is guaranteed to be non-zero. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function concludes, the variable `y` is 0, and the variable `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The returned value is the GCD, which is always a positive integer. Edge cases such as negative inputs are handled correctly, as the GCD computation is based on the Euclidean algorithm, which works regardless of the sign of the inputs.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
