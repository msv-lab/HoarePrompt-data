You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Gildong has an interesting machine that has an array a with n integers. The machine supports two kinds of operations:

  1. Increase all elements of a suffix of the array by 1. 
  2. Decrease all elements of a suffix of the array by 1. 



A suffix is a subsegment (contiguous elements) of the array that contains a_n. In other words, for all i where a_i is included in the subsegment, all a_j's where i < j ≤ n must also be included in the subsegment.

Gildong wants to make all elements of a equal — he will always do so using the minimum number of operations necessary. To make his life even easier, before Gildong starts using the machine, you have the option of changing one of the integers in the array to any other integer. You are allowed to leave the array unchanged. You want to minimize the number of operations Gildong performs. With your help, what is the minimum number of operations Gildong will perform?

Note that even if you change one of the integers in the array, you should not count that as one of the operations because Gildong did not perform it.

Input

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of elements of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers. The i-th integer is a_i (-5 ⋅ 10^8 ≤ a_i ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^8).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n in all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations Gildong has to perform in order to make all elements of the array equal.

Note

In the first case, all elements of the array are already equal. Therefore, we do not change any integer and Gildong will perform zero operations.

In the second case, we can set a_3 to be 0, so that the array becomes [-1,0,0]. Now Gildong can use the 2-nd operation once on the suffix starting at a_2, which means a_2 and a_3 are decreased by 1, making all elements of the array -1.

In the third case, we can set a_1 to 96, so that the array becomes [96,96,97,95]. Now Gildong needs to: 

  * Use the 2-nd operation on the suffix starting at a_3 once, making the array [96,96,96,94]. 
  * Use the 1-st operation on the suffix starting at a_4 2 times, making the array [96,96,96,96]. 



In the fourth case, we can change the array into [-3,-3,-2,1]. Now Gildong needs to: 

  * Use the 2-nd operation on the suffix starting at a_4 3 times, making the array [-3,-3,-2,-2]. 
  * Use the 2-nd operation on the suffix starting at a_3 once, making the array [-3,-3,-3,-3].

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
