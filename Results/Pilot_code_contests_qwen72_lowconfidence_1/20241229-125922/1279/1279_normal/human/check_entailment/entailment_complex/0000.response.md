Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not fully address the problem description. Specifically, the approach taken in `func_3` only considers a limited set of modifications to the array, which may not always lead to the optimal solution. The problem requires minimizing the number of operations Gildong performs, and this involves considering a broader range of possible changes to the array.

Here are the issues and a specific case where the program fails:

1. **Limited Modifications**: The function `func_3` only considers four specific modifications:
   - Swapping the first two elements.
   - Setting the first element to the second element.
   - Swapping the last two elements.
   - Setting the last element to the second-to-last element.

   This approach is too restrictive and may miss the optimal solution in many cases.

2. **Optimal Solution Consideration**: The problem description states that you can change one element to any other integer to minimize the number of operations. The current implementation does not consider changing any element to an arbitrary value, which could potentially lead to a lower cost.

### Specific Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The optimal solution here is to change the array to `[2, 2, 2, 2]` by changing the first element to 2. The cost would be:
- Change `1` to `2`: Cost = 0 (no change needed).
- Operations needed: 3 (to make all elements equal to 2).

However, the current implementation only considers the four specific modifications mentioned above, and none of these will result in the optimal solution. The program will likely output a higher cost because it does not explore the possibility of changing the first element to 2.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
