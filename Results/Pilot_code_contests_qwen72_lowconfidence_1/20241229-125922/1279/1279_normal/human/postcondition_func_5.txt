The function `func_5` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, where `y` is guaranteed to be non-zero. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function concludes, the variable `y` is 0, and the variable `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The returned value is the GCD, which is always a positive integer. Edge cases such as negative inputs are handled correctly, as the GCD computation is based on the Euclidean algorithm, which works regardless of the sign of the inputs.
