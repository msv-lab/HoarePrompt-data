Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle a specific edge case correctly. Consider the following input:

```
4
2 2 2 2
```

According to the problem description, this input should output `Possible` because a tree with 4 vertices where each vertex has a distance of 2 to the farthest vertex can be constructed. However, the program will output `Impossible` for this input. This is because the program checks if the count of the maximum value (`maxa`) is exactly 2 when `maxa` is odd, or exactly 1 when `maxa` is even. In this case, `maxa` is 2 (even), and its count is 4, which does not match the condition `a.count(l) == 1`, leading to an incorrect output of `Impossible`.

This indicates that the program is not handling all potential cases correctly, and thus it is incorrect.
