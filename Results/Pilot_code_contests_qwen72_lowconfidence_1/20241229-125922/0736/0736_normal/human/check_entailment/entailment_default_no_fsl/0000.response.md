Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program has issues with the following edge cases:

1. **Handling of Even and Odd `maxa`**:
   - The program uses integer division and addition to derive `l` differently for even and odd `maxa`. However, this approach may not correctly account for all possible configurations of distances in the tree.
   
2. **Checking for Minimum Distance**:
   - The program checks if all elements in `a` are greater than or equal to `l`, but it does not ensure that the minimum distance condition is met for all vertices. For example, in a tree with an even `maxa`, there should be exactly one vertex with distance `l` to the farthest vertex, and this vertex should have a unique property that is not checked in the program.

3. **Edge Case with Small Trees**:
   - The program does not correctly handle small trees. For example, consider the input:
     ```
     3
     1 1 1
     ```
     According to the problem description, this should output `Impossible` because it is impossible to construct a tree with three vertices where each vertex is only 1 unit away from the farthest vertex. However, the program does not correctly identify this case.

4. **Handling of Multiple Vertices with the Same Maximum Distance**:
   - The program checks if the count of `l` is exactly 2 for odd `maxa` and exactly 1 for even `maxa`. However, it does not ensure that these vertices are correctly placed in the tree structure, which is a critical part of the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
