You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Aoki loves numerical sequences and trees.

One day, Takahashi gave him an integer sequence of length N, a_1, a_2, ..., a_N, which made him want to construct a tree.

Aoki wants to construct a tree with N vertices numbered 1 through N, such that for each i = 1,2,...,N, the distance between vertex i and the farthest vertex from it is a_i, assuming that the length of each edge is 1.

Determine whether such a tree exists.

Constraints

* 2 ≦ N ≦ 100
* 1 ≦ a_i ≦ N-1

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N


Output

If there exists a tree that satisfies the condition, print `Possible`. Otherwise, print `Impossible`.

Program:

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    maxa = max(a)
    cmaxa = a.count(maxa)
    ca = [0] * (maxa + 1)
    for i in xrange(n):
        ca[a[i]] += 1
    if maxa % 2 == 1:
        l = maxa / 2 + 1
        if a.count(l) == 2:
            for i in xrange(n):
                if a[i] < l:
                    print('Impossible')
                    exit()
            for i in xrange(l + 1, maxa + 1):
                if ca[i] < 2:
                    print('Impossible')
                    exit()
            print('Possible')
        else:
            print('Impossible')
    else:
        l = maxa / 2
        if a.count(l) == 1:
            for i in xrange(n):
                if a[i] < l:
                    print('Impossible')
                    exit()
            for i in xrange(l + 1, maxa + 1):
                if ca[i] < 2:
                    print('Impossible')
                    exit()
            print('Possible')
        else:
            print('Impossible')


```
Output hints: The function reads two inputs: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n-1). It then determines whether the list `a` meets certain conditions based on the maximum value in `a` (`maxa`) and a derived value `l`. The conditions are as follows:

1. If `maxa` is odd:
   - `l` is set to `maxa / 2 + 1`.
   - The function checks if `l` appears exactly twice in `a`.
   - If `l` appears exactly twice, the function further checks if all elements in `a` are greater than or equal to `l`.
   - Additionally, it checks if for all values `i` in the range `l + 1` to `maxa + 1`, the count of `i` in `a` is at least 2.
   - If both conditions are met, the function prints 'Possible'. If any condition fails, the function prints 'Impossible' and exits.

2. If `maxa` is even:
   - `l` is set to `maxa / 2`.
   - The function checks if `l` appears exactly once in `a`.
   - If `l` appears exactly once, the function further checks if all elements in `a` are greater than or equal to `l`.
   - Additionally, it checks if for all values `i` in the range `l + 1` to `maxa + 1`, the count of `i` in `a` is at least 2.
   - If both conditions are met, the function prints 'Possible'. If any condition fails, the function prints 'Impossible' and exits.

If any of the conditions are not met, the function prints 'Impossible' and exits. If all conditions are met, the function prints 'Possible' and the program continues.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
