The code snippet provided simply prints the string 'Impossible' and does not alter any of the variables or their states. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the fact that the string 'Impossible' is printed.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `maxa` is even, `l` is `maxa / 2`, the count of `l` in `a` is 1, `i` is `l + 3`, for all elements `a[j]` in `a` where `0 ≤ j < n`, `a[j]` is greater than or equal to `l`, and `l + 3 < maxa + 1`. 'Impossible' is printed.**
