The code prints 'Impossible' and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `maxa` is even, `l` is `maxa / 2`, the count of `l` in `a` is 1, `i` is 0, and the value of `a[i]` is less than `l`.**
