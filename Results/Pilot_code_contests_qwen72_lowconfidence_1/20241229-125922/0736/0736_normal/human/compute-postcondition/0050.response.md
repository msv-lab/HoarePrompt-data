To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop:

### Given State:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.
- `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`.
- `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`.
- `maxa` is even.
- `l` is `maxa / 2`.
- The count of `l` in `a` is 1.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2, which means the loop will always execute at least once.

2. **Initialization of `i`**: The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`N`, `a`, `maxa`, `cmaxa`, `ca`, `l`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition but are part of the program state.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already guaranteed by the given condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 100).
- `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.
- All other variables (`N`, `a`, `maxa`, `cmaxa`, `ca`, `l`) remain as they are because they do not affect the loop's execution condition.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `maxa` is even, `l` is `maxa / 2`, the count of `l` in `a` is 1, `i` is 0**
