The function `func` does not explicitly show any parameters in its definition. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it seems there should be two parameters: `N` and `a`. 

- `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ N-1.

Since the function's output is not provided, I'll assume the function processes these parameters and returns a result based on them. Without specific output details, I'll describe the parameters the function accepts:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `N`, an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `a`, a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ N-1.**
