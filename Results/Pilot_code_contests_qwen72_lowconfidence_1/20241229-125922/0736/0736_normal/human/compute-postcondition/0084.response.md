Functionality: ** The function reads two inputs: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n-1). It then determines whether the list `a` meets certain conditions based on the maximum value in `a` (`maxa`) and a derived value `l`. The conditions are as follows:

1. If `maxa` is odd:
   - `l` is set to `maxa / 2 + 1`.
   - The function checks if `l` appears exactly twice in `a`.
   - If `l` appears exactly twice, the function further checks if all elements in `a` are greater than or equal to `l`.
   - Additionally, it checks if for all values `i` in the range `l + 1` to `maxa + 1`, the count of `i` in `a` is at least 2.
   - If both conditions are met, the function prints 'Possible'. If any condition fails, the function prints 'Impossible' and exits.

2. If `maxa` is even:
   - `l` is set to `maxa / 2`.
   - The function checks if `l` appears exactly once in `a`.
   - If `l` appears exactly once, the function further checks if all elements in `a` are greater than or equal to `l`.
   - Additionally, it checks if for all values `i` in the range `l + 1` to `maxa + 1`, the count of `i` in `a` is at least 2.
   - If both conditions are met, the function prints 'Possible'. If any condition fails, the function prints 'Impossible' and exits.

If any of the conditions are not met, the function prints 'Impossible' and exits. If all conditions are met, the function prints 'Possible' and the program continues. **

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `maxa` is 1 (the minimum possible value for `maxa` given the constraints), the function will still work correctly, but it will always print 'Impossible' because `l` will be 1 and there cannot be two occurrences of 1 in `a` when `maxa` is 1.
- If `a` contains duplicate maximum values, the function will correctly handle this by checking the count of `l` and the counts of other values in the specified ranges.
- If `a` contains no values that meet the conditions for `l`, the function will correctly print 'Impossible'.
