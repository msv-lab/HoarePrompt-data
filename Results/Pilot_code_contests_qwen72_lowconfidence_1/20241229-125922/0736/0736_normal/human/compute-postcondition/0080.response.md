The code snippet `print('Impossible')` executes and prints the string 'Impossible' to the console. This operation does not modify any of the variables or their values in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the action of printing.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `maxa` is even, `l` is `maxa / 2`, and `a.count(l)` is not equal to 1. 'Impossible' is printed to the console.**
