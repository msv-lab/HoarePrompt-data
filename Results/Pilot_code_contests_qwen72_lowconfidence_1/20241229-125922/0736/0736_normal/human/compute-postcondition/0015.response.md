To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and conditions based on the given state and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd.
- `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`.
- `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`.
- `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`.
- The current value of `l` is such that the number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, this condition is already satisfied.
2. **Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`N`, `a`, `maxa`, `cmaxa`, `ca`, `l`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition. However, they are part of the initial state and should be mentioned in the final state.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already true).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`N`, `a`, `maxa`, `cmaxa`, `ca`, `l`) remain as described in the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`, the number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2, `i` is 0**.
