To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.
- `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`.
- `ca[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.
- `ca[a[1]]` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Other Variables:
- `N`, `a`, `maxa`, `cmaxa`, and `ca` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the increment of `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `ca[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**.
