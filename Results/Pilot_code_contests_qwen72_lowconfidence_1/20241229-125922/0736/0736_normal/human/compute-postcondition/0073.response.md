To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.
- `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`.
- `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`.
- `maxa` is even.
- `l` is `maxa / 2`.
- The count of `l` in `a` is 1.
- `i` is `l + 2`.
- For all elements `a[j]` in `a` where `0 ≤ j < n`, `a[j]` is greater than or equal to `l`.
- If `ca[i]` is less than 2, 'Impossible' has been printed, and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with the original state unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(l + 1, maxa + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `l + 1` to `maxa + 1` (exclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `l + 2`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range `[l + 1, maxa + 1)`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Increment `i` by 1: `i` becomes `l + 3`.
- Ensure that `i` is still within the range `[l + 1, maxa + 1)`. Since `i` is now `l + 3`, it must be true that `l + 3 < maxa + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` is incremented to `l + 3`.
- The condition `l + 3 < maxa + 1` must hold for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `maxa` is even, `l` is `maxa / 2`, the count of `l` in `a` is 1, `i` is `l + 3`, for all elements `a[j]` in `a` where `0 ≤ j < n`, `a[j]` is greater than or equal to `l`, and `l + 3 < maxa + 1`.**
