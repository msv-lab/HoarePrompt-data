The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. This means no further code execution occurs after this point, and the program ends.

Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution stops.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`, the number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a[2]` must be such that `a[2] >= l`, and the program has terminated.**
