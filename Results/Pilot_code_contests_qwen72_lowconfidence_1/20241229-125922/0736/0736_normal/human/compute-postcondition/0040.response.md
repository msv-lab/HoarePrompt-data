The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. This means that no further execution of the program occurs, and the current state of the variables remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, the variables and their conditions remain as they were before the `exit()` call:

- `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd
- `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`
- `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`
- `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`
- The number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `l + 1` must be less than or equal to `maxa`
- `ca[i]` is less than 2

Since the program terminates, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`, the number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2, `i` is `n + 1`, `l + 1` must be less than or equal to `maxa`, and `ca[i]` is less than 2.**
