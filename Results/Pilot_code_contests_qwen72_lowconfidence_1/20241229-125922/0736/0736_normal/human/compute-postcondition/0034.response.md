To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given Conditions:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd.
- `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`.
- `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`.
- `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`.
- The number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `l + 1` must be less than or equal to `maxa`.
- If `ca[i]` is less than 2, the program execution is terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with no changes to the variables.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(l + 1, maxa + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is in the range `[l + 1, maxa + 1)`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Check the Loop Range**: The loop starts at `l + 1` and goes up to `maxa` (inclusive). Therefore, `i` must be within this range for the loop to execute.
2. **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n`.
3. **Ensure `i` is within the Range**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `maxa`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `n`.
- The loop will execute if `n` is within the range `[l + 1, maxa + 1)`.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`, the number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2, `i` is `n`, `l + 1` must be less than or equal to `maxa`. If `ca[i]` is less than 2, the program execution is terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with no changes to the variables.**
