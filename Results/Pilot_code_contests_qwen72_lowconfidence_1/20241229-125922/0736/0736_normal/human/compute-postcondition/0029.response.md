To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given Conditions:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd.
- `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`.
- `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`.
- `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`.
- The number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- If any `a[i] < l` for 0 ≤ i < n, the program has terminated with the message 'Impossible'.
- Otherwise, all elements in `a` are such that `a[i] >= l` for 0 ≤ i < n.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(l + 1, maxa + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `l + 1` to `maxa + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `l + 1` must be less than or equal to `maxa`.

2. **Initial State of `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is initially set to `n - 1`.
   - However, within the context of the loop, `i` will be redefined by the `xrange` function.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - `l` is defined as `maxa / 2 + 1`.
   - Since `maxa` is odd, `l` will be a float.
   - The loop will start from `l + 1`, which is `maxa / 2 + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute, `l + 1` (which is `maxa / 2 + 2`) must be less than or equal to `maxa`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `l + 1` is less than or equal to `maxa`.
- This condition is already satisfied because `l` is `maxa / 2 + 1`, and `maxa` is odd, so `l + 1` will always be less than `maxa`.

### Final State:
- The loop will execute if `l + 1` is less than or equal to `maxa`.
- Since `l` is `maxa / 2 + 1`, `l + 1` will be `maxa / 2 + 2`, which is always less than `maxa` for an odd `maxa`.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `l + 1` is less than or equal to `maxa`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`, the number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `l + 1` must be less than or equal to `maxa`**.
