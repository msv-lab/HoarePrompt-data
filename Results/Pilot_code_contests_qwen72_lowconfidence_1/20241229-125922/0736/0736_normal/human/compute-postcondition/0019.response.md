Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`, the number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2, `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is less than `l`, the string 'Impossible' is printed and the program exits.***
