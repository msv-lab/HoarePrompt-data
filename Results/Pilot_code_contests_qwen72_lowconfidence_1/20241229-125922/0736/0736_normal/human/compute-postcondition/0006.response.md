The code snippet `ca[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the value at the index `a[i]` in the list `ca` by 1.

- `N` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `n` remains an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `maxa` remains the maximum value in `a`.
- `cmaxa` remains the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`.
- `ca` is updated: the element at the index `a[0]` (since `i` is 0) is incremented by 1.
- `i` remains 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0.**
