The code snippet `ca[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `ca` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`
- `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`
- `ca[a[0]]` is incremented by 1
- `ca[a[1]]` is incremented by 1
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

After executing the code snippet, the value of `ca[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `ca[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `ca[a[2]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
