The variable `cmaxa` is assigned the count of occurrences of the maximum value in the list `a`. The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer between 2 and 100, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.

- `N` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `n` remains an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `maxa` remains the maximum value in `a`.
- `cmaxa` is now the number of times `maxa` appears in the list `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`.**
