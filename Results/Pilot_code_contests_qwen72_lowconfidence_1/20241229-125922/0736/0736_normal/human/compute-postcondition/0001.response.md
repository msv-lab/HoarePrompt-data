The code `a = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting sequence to `a`. The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `a` is a list of N integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ N-1, and `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).

After executing the code, `a` is updated to the new list of integers read from the input. The length of this new list is determined by the number of integers provided in the input. The values of `N` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
