Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `maxa` is even, `l` is `maxa / 2`. If `a.count(l)` is 1, `i` is `maxa + 1`, for all elements `a[j]` in `a` where `0 ≤ j < n`, `a[j]` is greater than or equal to `l`, if any `a[j]` is less than `l`, 'Impossible' is printed, and the program has terminated. If for any `i` in the range `l + 1` to `maxa`, `ca[i]` is less than 2, 'Impossible' is printed, and the program has terminated. Otherwise, 'Possible' is printed. If `a.count(l)` is not 1, 'Impossible' is printed to the console.***
