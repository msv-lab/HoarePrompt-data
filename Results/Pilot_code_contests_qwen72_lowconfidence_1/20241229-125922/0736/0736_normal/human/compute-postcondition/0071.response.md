The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. No further changes occur to the variables after this point. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions, as no new changes are applied.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `maxa` is even, `l` is `maxa / 2`, the count of `l` in `a` is 1, `i` is `l + 2`, for all elements `a[j]` in `a` where `0 ≤ j < n`, `a[j]` is greater than or equal to `l`. If any `a[j]` is less than `l`, 'Impossible' is printed, and the program has terminated. If `ca[i]` is less than 2, 'Impossible' has been printed, and the program has terminated. The string 'Impossible' has been printed.**
