To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.
   - `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`.
   - `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1`, with each element initialized to 0.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for i in xrange(n):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `n` is already defined as an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0.
   - The loop variable `i` should start at 0.

5. **Final State**:
   - The state should reflect that `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.
   - All other initial conditions remain the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
**`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` initialized to zeros, `i` is 0.**

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` initialized to zeros, `i` is 0.**
