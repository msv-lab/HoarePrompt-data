The code snippet initializes a list `ca` with zeros, where the length of the list is `maxa + 1`. This means that `ca` will have indices ranging from 0 to `maxa`, inclusive, each initialized to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `N` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `n` remains an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `maxa` remains the maximum value in `a`.
- `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1`, with each element initialized to 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` initialized to zeros.**
