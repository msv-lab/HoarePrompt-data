The code snippet `ca[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the dictionary `ca`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so this operation specifically increments the count of `a[1]` in the dictionary `ca`.

Therefore, the updated value in the dictionary `ca` for the key `a[1]` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `ca[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1.**
