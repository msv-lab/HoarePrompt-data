The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, which means `n` now holds an integer value provided by the user. Since `N` was an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `n` is assigned through user input, `n` should also be within this range. The list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `a` is a list of N integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100)**
