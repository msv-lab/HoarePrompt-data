The `exit()` function call causes the program to terminate immediately. This means that no further execution of the program will occur, and the current state of the program remains unchanged except for the fact that the program has ended.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`, the number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2, `i` is 1, and the program has terminated.**
