The provided Python code snippet `print('Impossible')` outputs the string 'Impossible' to the console. This operation does not alter any of the variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the action of printing 'Impossible'.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`, the number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than `l`. The string 'Impossible' has been printed.**
