The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. No further code execution occurs after this point, and the program does not return to any previous state or continue with any subsequent instructions.

Therefore, the output state includes all the information from the initial state, as no changes occur to the variables before the program exits.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a` and is odd, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `l` is a float equal to `maxa / 2 + 1`, the number of occurrences of `l` in `a` is exactly 2, `i` is `n`, `l + 1` must be less than or equal to `maxa`, and the program has terminated.**
