The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. As a result, no further changes to the variables occur, and the program ends without returning control to the caller.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `cmaxa` is the number of times `maxa` appears in `a`, `ca` is a list of length `maxa + 1` where each element at index `x` represents the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `maxa` is even, `l` is `maxa / 2`, the count of `l` in `a` is 1, `i` is `l + 3`, for all elements `a[j]` in `a` where `0 ≤ j < n`, `a[j]` is greater than or equal to `l`, and `l + 3 < maxa + 1`. 'Impossible' is printed. The program has exited.**
