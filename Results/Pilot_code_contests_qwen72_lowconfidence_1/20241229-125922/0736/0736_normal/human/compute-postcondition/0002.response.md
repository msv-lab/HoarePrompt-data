The value of `maxa` is assigned the maximum value from the list `a`. The values of `N` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.**
