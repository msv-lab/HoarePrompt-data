To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a_i` and `b_i` are strings representing valid T-shirt sizes for the previous year and the current year, respectively, for i ranging from 1 to n.
- The current execution context is the main module.
- `dic` is an empty dictionary.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since it is given that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, this condition is already satisfied.
2. **Variable `i`**: The loop variable `i` will start from 0 and go up to `n-1`. This is handled by the `xrange(n)` function.
3. **Variables `a_i` and `b_i`**: These are strings representing T-shirt sizes for the previous and current years, respectively. They are indexed by `i`, so they must be accessible within the loop.
4. **Dictionary `dic`**: This is an empty dictionary and does not affect the loop execution directly.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` should start at 0.
- **`a_i` and `b_i`**: These should be defined and accessible for each value of `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `a_i` and `b_i` are strings representing valid T-shirt sizes for the previous year and the current year, respectively, for i ranging from 0 to n-1, `dic` is an empty dictionary.**
