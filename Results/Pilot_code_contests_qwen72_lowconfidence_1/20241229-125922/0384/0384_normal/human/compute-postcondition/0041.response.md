Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. If the script is the main entry point, `i` is set to `n - 1`, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a unique T-shirt size input during the loop, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that T-shirt size was input minus the number of times it was matched and decremented. `ans` is the number of unique T-shirt sizes that were not found in `dic` or whose count in `dic` was 0 when they were encountered. If the script is not the main entry point, the state remains unchanged.***
