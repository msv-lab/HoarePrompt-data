Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is n-1, `a_i` and `b_i` are strings representing valid T-shirt sizes for the previous year and the current year, respectively, for i ranging from 1 to n, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a unique T-shirt size input during the loop, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that T-shirt size was input. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), `dic` remains an empty dictionary.**
