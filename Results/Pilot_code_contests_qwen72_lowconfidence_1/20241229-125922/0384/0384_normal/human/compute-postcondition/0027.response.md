The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `dic`, `s`) remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `s` is a user input string, and either `dic` does not contain the key `s` or `dic[s]` is less than or equal to 0, these conditions remain true.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 1, `s` is a user input string, and either `dic` does not contain the key `s` or `dic[s]` is less than or equal to 0**
