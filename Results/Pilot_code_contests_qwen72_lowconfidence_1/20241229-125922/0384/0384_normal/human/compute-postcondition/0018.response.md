The value of `dic[s]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `dic[s]` is not specified, but it is assumed to exist in the dictionary `dic` and holds an integer value. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a_i`, `b_i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `a_i` and `b_i` are strings representing valid T-shirt sizes for the previous year and the current year, respectively, for i ranging from 1 to n-1, `dic[s]` is incremented by 1, `s` is an input string, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
