The code snippet `print(ans)` prints the value of `ans` and does not alter any variables. Since the value of `ans` is printed, it remains unchanged. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `dic`) also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is n-1, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a unique T-shirt size input during the loop, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that T-shirt size was input minus the number of times it was matched and decremented. `ans` is the number of unique T-shirt sizes that were not found in `dic` or whose count in `dic` was 0 when they were encountered.**
