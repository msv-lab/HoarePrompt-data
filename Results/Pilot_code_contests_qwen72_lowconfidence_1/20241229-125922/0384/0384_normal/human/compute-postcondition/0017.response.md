The code snippet `dic[s] = 1` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `dic`, where the key is the string `s` and the value is `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `a_i` and `b_i` are strings representing valid T-shirt sizes for the previous year and the current year, respectively, for i ranging from 1 to n-1, `dic` is a dictionary with `dic[s] = 1`, `s` is an input string, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
