The code initializes an empty dictionary named `dic`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a_i`, or `b_i`. The current execution context remains the main module.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_i` and `b_i` are strings representing valid T-shirt sizes for the previous year and the current year, respectively, for i ranging from 1 to n, the current execution context is the main module, `dic` is an empty dictionary.**
