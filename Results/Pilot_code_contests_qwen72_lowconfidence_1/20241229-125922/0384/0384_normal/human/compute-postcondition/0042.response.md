The function `func` is described with the following parameter constraints and relationships: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a_i` and `b_i` are strings representing valid T-shirt sizes for the previous year and the current year, respectively, for i ranging from 1 to n. However, the provided function signature does not include any parameters, which suggests that the actual parameters (if any) might be missing or the function is designed to operate with predefined or external data.

Given the context and the typical structure of a function description, we can infer that the function should accept a list of tuples or two separate lists containing the T-shirt sizes from the previous year (`a_i`) and the current year (`b_i`). The function's primary task would likely involve comparing these sizes and producing some form of output based on the comparison.

However, since the exact parameters and the expected output are not specified in the function signature, I will describe the functionality based on the given constraints:

Functionality: **The function is expected to process a series of T-shirt size comparisons between the previous year and the current year for a given number of entries (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). It should return a result based on the comparison of these sizes, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
