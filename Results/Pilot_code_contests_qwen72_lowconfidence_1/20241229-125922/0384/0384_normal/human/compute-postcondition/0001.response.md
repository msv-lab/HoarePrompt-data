The code snippet reads an input and assigns it to the variable `n` as an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the value of `n` after execution will be within this range. The variables `a_i` and `b_i` are not affected by this code, and the context remains the main module.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_i` and `b_i` are strings representing valid T-shirt sizes for the previous year and the current year, respectively, for i ranging from 1 to n, the current execution context is the main module.**
