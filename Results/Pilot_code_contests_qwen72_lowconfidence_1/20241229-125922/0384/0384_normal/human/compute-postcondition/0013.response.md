The value of `dic[s]` is incremented by 1. Since `s` is an input string, the exact value of `s` is not known, but it is assumed to be a valid T-shirt size. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a_i`, `b_i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a_i` and `b_i` are strings representing valid T-shirt sizes for the previous year and the current year, respectively, for i ranging from 1 to n-1, `dic` is a dictionary where `dic[s]` is incremented by 1, `s` is an input string.**
