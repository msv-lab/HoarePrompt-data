To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `dic` is a dictionary.
   - `ans` is 0 or 1.
   - `s` is a user input string.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `dic` and `ans` may have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it is the iteration variable).
- `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

The other variables (`dic`, `ans`, and `s`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless explicitly modified in the loop body. However, since we are only asked to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on `i` and `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `dic` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0 or 1, and `s` is a user input string.**
