`s` is assigned the value of the user input through `raw_input()`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a_i` and `b_i` are strings representing valid T-shirt sizes for the previous year and the current year, respectively, for i ranging from 1 to n-1, `dic` is a dictionary. If `s` is not a key in `dic`, then `dic[s]` is set to 1. If `s` is already a key in `dic`, then the value of `dic[s]` is incremented by 1, `s` is an input string.**
