Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `dic` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0 or 1, and `s` is a user input string. If `dic` contains the key `s` and `dic[s]` > 0, the value associated with `s` in `dic` is decremented by 1. If `dic` does not contain the key `s` or `dic[s]` is less than or equal to 0, `ans` is set to 1.***
