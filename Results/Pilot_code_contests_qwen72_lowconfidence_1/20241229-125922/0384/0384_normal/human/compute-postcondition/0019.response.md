Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `a_i` and `b_i` are strings representing valid T-shirt sizes for the previous year and the current year, respectively, for i ranging from 1 to n-1, `dic` is a dictionary, `s` is an input string, and `n` must be greater than 2. If `s` is not a key in `dic`, then `dic[s]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dic[s]` is incremented by 1.***
