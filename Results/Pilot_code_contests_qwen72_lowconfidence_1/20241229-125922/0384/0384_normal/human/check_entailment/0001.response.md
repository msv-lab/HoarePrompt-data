Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the order of the T-shirt sizes is different between the previous and current year lists, but the counts of each size are the same. The program assumes that the order of the sizes matters, which is not the case according to the problem description. The problem states that two lists are considered equal if the number of occurrences of any string is the same in both lists, regardless of their order.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
XS
XS
M
XS
XS
M
```

According to the problem description, the output should be `0` because the lists are already equal in terms of the number of occurrences of each size. However, the program will output `2` because it does not account for the fact that the lists are considered equal if they contain the same number of each size, regardless of order.

This is a clear violation of the problem requirements, making the program incorrect.
