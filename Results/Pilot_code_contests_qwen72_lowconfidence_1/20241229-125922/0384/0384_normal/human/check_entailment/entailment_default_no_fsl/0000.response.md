Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to account for the possibility of reusing T-shirt sizes that appear multiple times in the previous year's list to minimize the number of changes required.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:

Consider the following input:
```
3
XS
XS
M
XL
S
XS
```

According to the problem description, the output should be `2` because:
- One "XS" can be changed to "S" by replacing the "X" with "S".
- The "M" can be changed to "XL" by replacing "M" with "L" and adding "X" (but since we can only replace characters, this would actually require two changes: "M" to "L" and "X" to "X").

However, the provided program will output `3` because it does not correctly handle the reuse of T-shirt sizes. It simply counts the number of unmatched T-shirt sizes without considering the optimal way to match them.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Count the occurrences of each T-shirt size in both the previous and current year's lists.
2. For each size in the current year's list, try to match it with a size in the previous year's list, decrementing the count of the matched size.
3. If a match is not found, increment the number of changes required.

This approach ensures that the minimal number of changes is calculated correctly. The provided program does not implement this logic correctly, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
