The function processes a series of T-shirt size inputs for two consecutive years. It reads `n` T-shirt sizes for the previous year and stores their counts in a dictionary. Then, it reads `n` T-shirt sizes for the current year and decrements the counts in the dictionary if a matching size is found. Finally, it prints the number of T-shirt sizes from the current year that do not have a match in the previous year's sizes. The function only executes if it is the main entry point of the script. If the script is not the main entry point, no action is taken. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 0, resulting in an empty dictionary and `ans` being 0. Missing functionality includes handling invalid input formats, such as non-integer values for `n` or non-string values for T-shirt sizes.
