Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases and processes each case by comparing the characters of strings `a`, `b`, and `c` at each position. If at any position `j`, both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are different from `c[j]`, it sets a flag `f` to 1 and breaks out of the loop, indicating that it is impossible to make `a` equal to `b`. If no such position is found, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make `a` equal to `b` through the described swaps. This logic aligns with the problem requirements, and I cannot find a case where the program would fail to produce the correct output.
