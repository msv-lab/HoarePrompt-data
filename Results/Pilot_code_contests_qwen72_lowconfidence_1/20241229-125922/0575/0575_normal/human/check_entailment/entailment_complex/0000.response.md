Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the key aspects to ensure it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case**:
   - For each character position `j` in the strings, the program checks if `c[j]` is different from both `a[j]` and `b[j]`.
   - If such a position is found, the flag `f` is set to 1, and the loop breaks.
   - If no such position is found, `f` remains 0.

3. **Output**:
   - If `f` is 0, it means that for every position `j`, `c[j]` can be swapped with either `a[j]` or `b[j]` to make `a` equal to `b`. Therefore, the program prints 'YES'.
   - If `f` is 1, it means there is at least one position `j` where `c[j]` cannot be swapped with either `a[j]` or `b[j]` to make `a` equal to `b`. Therefore, the program prints 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the strings are of length 1.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases as specified by the input format.

5. **Assumptions**:
   - The program assumes that the input is valid and follows the constraints given in the problem description (1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the strings are of the same length and contain lowercase English letters only).

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases within the constraints, it is correct. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
