Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only checks if for any index `j`, both `b[j]` and `a[j]` are different from `c[j]`. However, this check alone is insufficient to determine if it's possible to make `a` equal to `b` by swapping elements of `c` with either `a` or `b`.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
abc
cba
ccc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
- For the input `a = "abc"`, `b = "cba"`, and `c = "ccc"`, it is possible to make `a` equal to `b` by performing the following swaps:
  - Swap `c[0]` with `a[0]`: `a = "ccc"`, `b = "cba"`, `c = "abc"`
  - Swap `c[1]` with `b[1]`: `a = "ccb"`, `b = "cbb"`, `c = "aca"`
  - Swap `c[2]` with `b[2]`: `a = "ccb"`, `b = "ccb"`, `c = "aca"`

After these swaps, `a` becomes equal to `b`. However, the program will output `NO` because it only checks if `c[j]` is different from both `a[j]` and `b[j]`, which is not a sufficient condition to determine the possibility of making `a` equal to `b`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
