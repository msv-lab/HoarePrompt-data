Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code checks if there exists an index `j` such that both `b[j]` and `a[j]` are different from `c[j]`. If such an index is found, it immediately concludes that it is impossible to make `a` equal to `b` by swapping `c` with either `a` or `b`. However, this logic is insufficient because it does not consider all possible scenarios where `a` can be made equal to `b`.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
abc
bca
bca
```
According to the problem description, it is possible to make `a` equal to `b` by swapping `c` with `a` for all indices. After the swaps, `a` becomes "bca", `b` becomes "bca", and `c` becomes "abc". Here, `a` and `b` are equal.

However, the provided code would incorrectly output "NO" because it finds that `a[0]` ('a') and `b[0]` ('b') are both different from `c[0]` ('b'), and thus it concludes that it is impossible to make `a` equal to `b`.

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases correctly, and hence it is incorrect.
