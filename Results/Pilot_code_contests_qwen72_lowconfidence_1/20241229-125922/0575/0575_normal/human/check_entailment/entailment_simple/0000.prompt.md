You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given three strings a, b and c of the same length n. The strings consist of lowercase English letters only. The i-th letter of a is a_i, the i-th letter of b is b_i, the i-th letter of c is c_i.

For every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) you must swap (i.e. exchange) c_i with either a_i or b_i. So in total you'll perform exactly n swap operations, each of them either c_i ↔ a_i or c_i ↔ b_i (i iterates over all integers between 1 and n, inclusive).

For example, if a is "code", b is "true", and c is "help", you can make c equal to "crue" taking the 1-st and the 4-th letters from a and the others from b. In this way a becomes "hodp" and b becomes "tele".

Is it possible that after these swaps the string a becomes exactly the same as the string b?

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters a.

The second line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters b.

The third line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters c.

It is guaranteed that in each test case these three strings are non-empty and have the same length, which is not exceeding 100.

Output

Print t lines with answers for all test cases. For each test case:

If it is possible to make string a equal to string b print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print either lowercase or uppercase letters in the answers.

Example

Input


4
aaa
bbb
ccc
abc
bca
bca
aabb
bbaa
baba
imi
mii
iim


Output


NO
YES
YES
NO

Note

In the first test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string a becomes exactly the same as string b.

In the second test case, you should swap c_i with a_i for all possible i. After the swaps a becomes "bca", b becomes "bca" and c becomes "abc". Here the strings a and b are equal.

In the third test case, you should swap c_1 with a_1, c_2 with b_2, c_3 with b_3 and c_4 with a_4. Then string a becomes "baba", string b becomes "baba" and string c becomes "abab". Here the strings a and b are equal.

In the fourth test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string a becomes exactly the same as string b.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math
import heapq
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are strings of lowercase English letters of the same length (1 ≤ length ≤ 100).
def func():
    num = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(num):
        a = raw_input()
        
        b = raw_input()
        
        c = raw_input()
        
        f = 0
        
        for j in range(len(a)):
            if b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]:
                f = 1
                break
        
        if f == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last input strings of lowercase English letters of the same length (1 ≤ length ≤ 100), `num` is the input integer, `i` is `num - 1` (indicating the loop has completed `num` iterations), `j` is the last index of `a` if the inner loop completes without breaking or the index where `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met if the inner loop breaks. For each iteration of the outer loop, if `f` is 0, it indicates that there does not exist an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`, and 'YES' is printed to the console. If `f` is 1, it indicates that there exists an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`, and 'NO' is printed to the console.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
