Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in the program checks if `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]` for any index `i`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if `a` can be made equal to `b` after the swaps. The program fails to consider the possibility that `c[i]` could be used to swap with either `a[i]` or `b[i]` to achieve the final goal.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
abc
cba
ccc
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, it is possible to make `a` equal to `b` by swapping `c[0]` with `a[0]`, `c[1]` with `b[1]`, and `c[2]` with `b[2]`. After these swaps, `a` becomes "cba", `b` becomes "cba", and `c` becomes "abc". However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it only checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, which is not a sufficient condition.

To fix this, the program needs to check if for each index `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` can be swapped with `c[i]` to eventually make `a` equal to `b`.
