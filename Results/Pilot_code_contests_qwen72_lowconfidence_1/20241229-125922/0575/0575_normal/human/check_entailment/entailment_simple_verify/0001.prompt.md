You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given three strings a, b and c of the same length n. The strings consist of lowercase English letters only. The i-th letter of a is a_i, the i-th letter of b is b_i, the i-th letter of c is c_i.

For every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) you must swap (i.e. exchange) c_i with either a_i or b_i. So in total you'll perform exactly n swap operations, each of them either c_i ↔ a_i or c_i ↔ b_i (i iterates over all integers between 1 and n, inclusive).

For example, if a is "code", b is "true", and c is "help", you can make c equal to "crue" taking the 1-st and the 4-th letters from a and the others from b. In this way a becomes "hodp" and b becomes "tele".

Is it possible that after these swaps the string a becomes exactly the same as the string b?

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters a.

The second line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters b.

The third line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters c.

It is guaranteed that in each test case these three strings are non-empty and have the same length, which is not exceeding 100.

Output

Print t lines with answers for all test cases. For each test case:

If it is possible to make string a equal to string b print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print either lowercase or uppercase letters in the answers.

Example

Input


4
aaa
bbb
ccc
abc
bca
bca
aabb
bbaa
baba
imi
mii
iim


Output


NO
YES
YES
NO

Note

In the first test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string a becomes exactly the same as string b.

In the second test case, you should swap c_i with a_i for all possible i. After the swaps a becomes "bca", b becomes "bca" and c becomes "abc". Here the strings a and b are equal.

In the third test case, you should swap c_1 with a_1, c_2 with b_2, c_3 with b_3 and c_4 with a_4. Then string a becomes "baba", string b becomes "baba" and string c becomes "abab". Here the strings a and b are equal.

In the fourth test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string a becomes exactly the same as string b.
Program:
```
import math
import heapq
import sys

def func():
    num = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(num):
        a = raw_input()
        b = raw_input()
        c = raw_input()
        f = 0
        for j in range(len(a)):
            if b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]:
                f = 1
                break
        if f == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in the program checks if `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]` for any index `i`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if `a` can be made equal to `b` after the swaps. The program fails to consider the possibility that `c[i]` could be used to swap with either `a[i]` or `b[i]` to achieve the final goal.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
abc
cba
ccc
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, it is possible to make `a` equal to `b` by swapping `c[0]` with `a[0]`, `c[1]` with `b[1]`, and `c[2]` with `b[2]`. After these swaps, `a` becomes "cba", `b` becomes "cba", and `c` becomes "abc". However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it only checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, which is not a sufficient condition.

To fix this, the program needs to check if for each index `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` can be swapped with `c[i]` to eventually make `a` equal to `b`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math
import heapq
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are strings of lowercase English letters of the same length (1 ≤ length ≤ 100).
def func():
    num = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(num):
        a = raw_input()
        
        b = raw_input()
        
        c = raw_input()
        
        f = 0
        
        for j in range(len(a)):
            if b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]:
                f = 1
                break
        
        if f == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last input strings of lowercase English letters of the same length (1 ≤ length ≤ 100), `num` is the input integer, `i` is `num - 1` (indicating the loop has completed `num` iterations), `j` is the last index of `a` if the inner loop completes without breaking or the index where `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met if the inner loop breaks. For each iteration of the outer loop, if `f` is 0, it indicates that there does not exist an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`, and 'YES' is printed to the console. If `f` is 1, it indicates that there exists an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`, and 'NO' is printed to the console.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
