You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given three strings a, b and c of the same length n. The strings consist of lowercase English letters only. The i-th letter of a is a_i, the i-th letter of b is b_i, the i-th letter of c is c_i.

For every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) you must swap (i.e. exchange) c_i with either a_i or b_i. So in total you'll perform exactly n swap operations, each of them either c_i ↔ a_i or c_i ↔ b_i (i iterates over all integers between 1 and n, inclusive).

For example, if a is "code", b is "true", and c is "help", you can make c equal to "crue" taking the 1-st and the 4-th letters from a and the others from b. In this way a becomes "hodp" and b becomes "tele".

Is it possible that after these swaps the string a becomes exactly the same as the string b?

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters a.

The second line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters b.

The third line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters c.

It is guaranteed that in each test case these three strings are non-empty and have the same length, which is not exceeding 100.

Output

Print t lines with answers for all test cases. For each test case:

If it is possible to make string a equal to string b print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print either lowercase or uppercase letters in the answers.

Example

Input


4
aaa
bbb
ccc
abc
bca
bca
aabb
bbaa
baba
imi
mii
iim


Output


NO
YES
YES
NO

Note

In the first test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string a becomes exactly the same as string b.

In the second test case, you should swap c_i with a_i for all possible i. After the swaps a becomes "bca", b becomes "bca" and c becomes "abc". Here the strings a and b are equal.

In the third test case, you should swap c_1 with a_1, c_2 with b_2, c_3 with b_3 and c_4 with a_4. Then string a becomes "baba", string b becomes "baba" and string c becomes "abab". Here the strings a and b are equal.

In the fourth test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string a becomes exactly the same as string b.
Program:
```
import math
import heapq
import sys

def func():
    num = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(num):
        a = raw_input()
        b = raw_input()
        c = raw_input()
        f = 0
        for j in range(len(a)):
            if b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]:
                f = 1
                break
        if f == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases and processes each case by comparing the characters of strings `a`, `b`, and `c` at each position. If at any position `j`, both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are different from `c[j]`, it sets a flag `f` to 1 and breaks out of the loop, indicating that it is impossible to make `a` equal to `b`. If no such position is found, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make `a` equal to `b` through the described swaps. This logic aligns with the problem requirements, and I cannot find a case where the program would fail to produce the correct output.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of lowercase English letters, all of the same length (1 ≤ length ≤ 100). The function then checks for each test case if there exists an index `j` such that both `b[j]` and `a[j]` are different from `c[j]`. If no such index exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function terminates. The final state of the program includes `t` being a positive integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` being the last input strings for the final test case, and the variable `num` holding the value of `t`. The variables `i` and `j` are also present, with `i` being `num - 1` and `j` being the last index checked or the index where the condition failed, depending on the test case.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
