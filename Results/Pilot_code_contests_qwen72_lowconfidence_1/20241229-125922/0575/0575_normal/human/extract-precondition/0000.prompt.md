You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given three strings a, b and c of the same length n. The strings consist of lowercase English letters only. The i-th letter of a is a_i, the i-th letter of b is b_i, the i-th letter of c is c_i.

For every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) you must swap (i.e. exchange) c_i with either a_i or b_i. So in total you'll perform exactly n swap operations, each of them either c_i ↔ a_i or c_i ↔ b_i (i iterates over all integers between 1 and n, inclusive).

For example, if a is "code", b is "true", and c is "help", you can make c equal to "crue" taking the 1-st and the 4-th letters from a and the others from b. In this way a becomes "hodp" and b becomes "tele".

Is it possible that after these swaps the string a becomes exactly the same as the string b?

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters a.

The second line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters b.

The third line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters c.

It is guaranteed that in each test case these three strings are non-empty and have the same length, which is not exceeding 100.

Output

Print t lines with answers for all test cases. For each test case:

If it is possible to make string a equal to string b print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print either lowercase or uppercase letters in the answers.

Example

Input


4
aaa
bbb
ccc
abc
bca
bca
aabb
bbaa
baba
imi
mii
iim


Output


NO
YES
YES
NO

Note

In the first test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string a becomes exactly the same as string b.

In the second test case, you should swap c_i with a_i for all possible i. After the swaps a becomes "bca", b becomes "bca" and c becomes "abc". Here the strings a and b are equal.

In the third test case, you should swap c_1 with a_1, c_2 with b_2, c_3 with b_3 and c_4 with a_4. Then string a becomes "baba", string b becomes "baba" and string c becomes "abab". Here the strings a and b are equal.

In the fourth test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string a becomes exactly the same as string b.
