The function reads a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of lowercase English letters, all of the same length (1 ≤ length ≤ 100). The function then checks for each test case if there exists an index `j` such that both `b[j]` and `a[j]` are different from `c[j]`. If no such index exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function terminates. The final state of the program includes `t` being a positive integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` being the last input strings for the final test case, and the variable `num` holding the value of `t`. The variables `i` and `j` are also present, with `i` being `num - 1` and `j` being the last index checked or the index where the condition failed, depending on the test case.
