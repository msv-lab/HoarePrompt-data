Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters and must be non-empty, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. If `b[1]` is not equal to `c[1]` and `a[1]` is not equal to `c[1]`, then `f` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `f` remains 0.***
