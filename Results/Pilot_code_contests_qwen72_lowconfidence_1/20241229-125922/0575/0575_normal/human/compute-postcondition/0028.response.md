The line of code `c = raw_input()` reads a new input from the user and assigns it to the variable `c`. This changes the value of `c` from its initial state to the new input string of lowercase English letters.

The initial conditions state that `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters of the same length as `b`. After executing the code, `c` will still be a string of lowercase English letters, but its specific value is now the input provided by the user.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `num`, `i`, `j`, `f`) are not affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

**`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is the new input string of lowercase English letters, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the last index of `a` (if the loop completes without breaking) or the index where the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met (if the loop breaks), `f` is 0 if the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was never met throughout the loop, `f` is 1 if the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met at some point.**
