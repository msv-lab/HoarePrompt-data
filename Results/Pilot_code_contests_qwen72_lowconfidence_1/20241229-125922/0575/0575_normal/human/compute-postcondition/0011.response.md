To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)
- `a` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters
- `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters
- `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters of the same length as the original `b` (1 ≤ length ≤ 100)
- `num` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `f` is 0
- The loop condition is `for j in range(len(a))`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range of `len(a)`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is some value, and the loop needs to execute one more time.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Increment `j`**: Since the loop iterates over the indices of the string `a`, `j` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
- **Check Conditions**: The loop will continue as long as `j < len(a)`. Therefore, `len(a)` must be greater than the current value of `j`.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `num` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `f` remains unchanged.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters of the same length as the original `b` (1 ≤ length ≤ 100), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is 0, and `j` is 1, and `len(a)` must be greater than 1.**
