The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `f` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
