To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to start and continue executing:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(len(a)):` will execute if `len(a)` is greater than 0. This means that `a` must be a non-empty string.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
   - `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters.
   - `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters.
   - `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters.
   - `num` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is the last index of `a` (if the loop completes without breaking) or the index where the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met (if the loop breaks).
   - `f` is 0.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must be a non-empty string. Therefore, `len(a)` must be greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `j` should be 0, as the loop will start from the first index of `a`.

Given these points, the adjusted state should ensure that `a` is non-empty and `j` is initialized correctly.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters that must be non-empty, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `f` is 0**
