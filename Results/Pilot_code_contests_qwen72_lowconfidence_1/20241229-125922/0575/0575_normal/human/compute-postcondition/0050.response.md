The code snippet provided is:

```
a = raw_input()
```

This line of code assigns the value of user input to the variable `a`. Since the function `raw_input()` is used (which is typical in Python 2), the input will be taken as a string. According to the initial state, `a` is expected to be a new input string of lowercase English letters. The other variables (`t`, `b`, `c`, `num`, `i`, `j`, and `f`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is the last index of `a` if the loop completes without breaking or the index where `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met if the loop breaks, `f` is 0 if there does not exist an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`, `f` is 1 if there exists an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`.**
