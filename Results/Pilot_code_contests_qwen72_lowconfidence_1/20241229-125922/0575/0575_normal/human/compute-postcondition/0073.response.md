Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last input strings of lowercase English letters of the same length (1 ≤ length ≤ 100), `num` is the input integer, `i` is `num - 1` (indicating the loop has completed `num` iterations), `j` is the last index of `a` if the inner loop completes without breaking or the index where `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met if the inner loop breaks. For each iteration of the outer loop, if `f` is 0, it indicates that there does not exist an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`, and 'YES' is printed to the console. If `f` is 1, it indicates that there exists an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
