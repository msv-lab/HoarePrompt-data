The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block immediately. However, it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters of the same length as the original `b` (1 ≤ length ≤ 100), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is 1, and at the current index `j`, `b[j]` is not equal to `c[j]` and `a[j]` is not equal to `c[j]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
