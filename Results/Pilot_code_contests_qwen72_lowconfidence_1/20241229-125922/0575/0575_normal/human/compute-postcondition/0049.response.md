To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters.
- `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters.
- `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters.
- `num` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is the last index of `a` if the loop completes without breaking or the index where `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met if the loop breaks.
- `f` is 0 if there does not exist an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`.
- `f` is 1 if there exists an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for i in range(num):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `num`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `num` is greater than 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` must be incremented from 1 to 2.
- The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `num`, `j`, and `f`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the loop increment.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is the last index of `a` if the loop completes without breaking or the index where `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met if the loop breaks, `f` is 0 if there does not exist an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`, `f` is 1 if there exists an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`.**
