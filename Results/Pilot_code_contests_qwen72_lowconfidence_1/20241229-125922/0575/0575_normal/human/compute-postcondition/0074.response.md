The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Here, `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings composed of lowercase English letters, all of the same length, where the length is within the range 1 ≤ length ≤ 100.

The function's output is not specified in the given context, but based on the typical structure of such functions, it likely processes each test case and returns some result based on the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`.

However, since the specific output is not detailed in the provided information, I will describe the functionality based on the given parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and for each of the `t` test cases, it accepts three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of lowercase English letters, all of the same length (1 ≤ length ≤ 100). The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**
