Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters of the same length as `b` (1 ≤ length ≤ 100), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 2. If `b[2]` is not equal to `c[2]` and `a[2]` is not equal to `c[2]`, `f` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with no change to the variables.***
