The code snippet provided only contains a print statement, which outputs the string 'YES' to the console. This operation does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, all variables retain their original values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is the last index of `a` if the loop completes without breaking or the index where `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met if the loop breaks, `f` is 0, indicating that there does not exist an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`.**
