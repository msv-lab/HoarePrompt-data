Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a`, `b`, and `c` are new input strings of lowercase English letters, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is the last index of `a` if the loop completes without breaking or the index where `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met if the loop breaks. If `f` is 0, it indicates that there does not exist an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`. If `f` is 1, it indicates that there exists an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`.***
