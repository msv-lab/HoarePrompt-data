Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters of the same length as `b` (1 ≤ length ≤ 100), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is the last index of `a` (if the loop completes without breaking) or the index where the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met (if the loop breaks). `f` is set to 1.**
