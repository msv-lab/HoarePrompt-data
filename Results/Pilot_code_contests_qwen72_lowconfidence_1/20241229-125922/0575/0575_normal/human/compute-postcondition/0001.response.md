To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the state and the loop conditions:

1. **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)**: This indicates the number of test cases.
2. **a, b, and c are strings of lowercase English letters of the same length (1 ≤ length ≤ 100)**: These are the input strings for each test case.
3. **num is an input integer**: This determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(num):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute:
- The variable `num` must be greater than 0. If `num` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.

Let's consider the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of the same length.
- `num` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state to include the condition that `num` must be greater than 0. Additionally, the loop counter `i` should start at 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of lowercase English letters of the same length (1 ≤ length ≤ 100), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
