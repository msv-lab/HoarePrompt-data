Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is the last index of `a` if the loop completes without breaking or the index where `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met if the loop breaks, `f` is 1 if there exists an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`, otherwise `f` is 0.**
