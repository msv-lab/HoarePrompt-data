The code snippet `c = raw_input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `c`. Since `c` was previously described as a new input string of lowercase English letters, this operation updates `c` with a new string provided by the user.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `num`, `i`, `j`, and `f` are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is the last index of `a` if the loop completes without breaking or the index where `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met if the loop breaks, `f` is 0 if there does not exist an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`, `f` is 1 if there exists an index `j` such that `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]`.**
