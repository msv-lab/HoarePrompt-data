To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)
   - `a` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters
   - `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters
   - `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters of the same length as `b` (1 ≤ length ≤ 100)
   - `num` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is the last index of `a` (if the loop completes without breaking) or the index where the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met (if the loop breaks)
   - `f` is 0 if the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was never met throughout the loop
   - `f` is 1 if the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met at some point

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(num):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `num`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `num` must be greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented to 1
- `num` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1)

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `j`, `f`) do not change based on the loop condition alone. They remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters of the same length as `b` (1 ≤ length ≤ 100), `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the last index of `a` (if the loop completes without breaking) or the index where the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met (if the loop breaks), `f` is 0 if the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was never met throughout the loop, `f` is 1 if the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met at some point**
