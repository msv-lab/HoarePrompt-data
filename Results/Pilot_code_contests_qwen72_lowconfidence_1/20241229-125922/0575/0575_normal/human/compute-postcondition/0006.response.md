To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the for loop:

### Given State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)
- `a` is a string of lowercase English letters
- `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters
- `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters of the same length as the original `b` (1 ≤ length ≤ 100)
- `num` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `f` is 0

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(len(a)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will iterate over the indices of the string `a`.
- The number of iterations depends on the length of `a`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- The loop will execute if `len(a)` is greater than 0. If `a` is an empty string, the loop will not execute.

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `a` must be a non-empty string.
- The other variables (`t`, `b`, `c`, `num`, `i`, `f`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they should remain consistent with their initial conditions.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters of the same length as the original `b` (1 ≤ length ≤ 100), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is 0**
