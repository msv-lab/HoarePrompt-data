The code snippet `print('NO')` simply outputs the string 'NO' to the console. This operation does not alter the state of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `num`, `i`, `j`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the last index of `a` if the loop completes without breaking or the index where `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met if the loop breaks, `f` is 1.**
