Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters and must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `b[j]` is not equal to `c[j]` and `a[j]` is not equal to `c[j]`, then `f` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `f`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
