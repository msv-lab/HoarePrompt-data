Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a new input string of lowercase English letters that must be non-empty, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If `b[0]` is not equal to `c[0]` and `a[0]` is not equal to `c[0]`, then `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `f` remains 0.***
