The provided Python code snippet only contains a print statement, which outputs 'YES' to the console. This does not alter any of the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state, except for the fact that 'YES' has been printed to the console. Since the print action itself does not modify the program's state, the variables retain their original values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a new input string of lowercase English letters, `c` is a new input string of lowercase English letters of the same length as `b` (1 ≤ length ≤ 100), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is the last index of `a` (if the loop completes without breaking) or the index where the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was met (if the loop breaks), `f` is 0, indicating that the condition `b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]` was never met throughout the loop. 'YES' has been printed to the console.**
