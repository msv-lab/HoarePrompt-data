The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list representing the configuration of N switches, where each element is either 0 or 1, indicating "off" or "on". `b` is a list representing the configuration of M bulbs, where each element is a list containing the switch indices connected to the bulb followed by the parity requirement \( p_i \) which is 0 or 1. The lengths of `a` and `b` satisfy \( 1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 10 \) and \( 1 \leq \text{len}(b) \leq 10 \), respectively. Each switch index in `b` is an integer between 1 and len(a), inclusive, and each \( p_i \) in `b` is either 0 or 1.

The function returns the sum of the products of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b`.

However, the description of the output seems incorrect or incomplete based on the typical problem setup involving switch and bulb configurations. A more accurate description of the output would be:

The function returns the number of bulbs that are turned on based on the configuration of the switches and their respective parity requirements.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is:
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of integers (0 or 1) representing the state of N switches, and `b` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the switch indices connected to a bulb and the parity requirement \( p_i \) (0 or 1). The function returns the number of bulbs that are turned on based on the configuration of the switches and their respective parity requirements.**
