Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of integers (0 or 1) representing the state of N switches, and `b` is a list of integers where each element corresponds to a bulb's requirement (0 or 1). The function returns the sum of the products of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`. However, the provided code and annotations suggest a mismatch in the intended functionality and the actual implementation. The code currently sums the products of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`, but the intended functionality described in the annotations suggests that `b` should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains switch indices and a parity requirement. The current implementation does not handle the structure of `b` as described in the annotations, and thus does not correctly determine the number of bulbs that are turned on based on the switch configurations and their parity requirements. The function returns an integer value, which is the sum of the products of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`. **

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Mismatch in Input Types**: If `b` is expected to be a list of lists as described in the annotations, the current implementation will fail because it treats `b` as a flat list.
- **Incorrect Summation Logic**: The current summation logic multiplies corresponding elements from `a` and `b`, which is not aligned with the intended functionality of checking bulb states based on switch configurations and parity requirements.
- **Input Lengths**: The function assumes that `a` and `b` have the same length, which may not always be the case if `b` is a list of lists as described in the annotations.
- **Parity Requirement Handling**: The function does not handle the parity requirement (`p_i`) for each bulb, which is crucial for determining whether a bulb is turned on or off.
