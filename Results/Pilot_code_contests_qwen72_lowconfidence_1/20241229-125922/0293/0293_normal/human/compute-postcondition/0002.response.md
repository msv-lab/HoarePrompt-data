The value of `c` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is 0, the first elements of `a` and `b` are used. The new value of `c` will be the product of the first elements of `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of N switches where 1 <= len(a) <= 10, `b` is a list of M bulbs where 1 <= len(b) <= 10, each switch index in `b` is an integer between 1 and len(a), inclusive, each p_i in `b` is either 0 or 1, `c` is `a[0] * b[0]`, `i` is 0**
