Output State: **a and b are lists where a represents the configuration of N switches (each element is either 0 or 1 indicating "off" or "on"), and b represents the configuration of M bulbs (each element is a list containing the switch indices connected to the bulb followed by the parity requirement p_i which is 0 or 1). The lengths of a and b satisfy 1 <= len(a) <= 10 and 1 <= len(b) <= 10, respectively. Each switch index in b is an integer between 1 and len(a), inclusive, and each p_i in b is either 0 or 1; c is 0.**
