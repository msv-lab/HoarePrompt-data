The value of `c` is updated by adding `a[i] * b[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 2, the specific calculation is `c += a[2] * b[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of N switches where 1 <= len(a) <= 10, `b` is a list of M bulbs where 1 <= len(b) <= 10, each switch index in `b` is an integer between 1 and len(a), inclusive, each p_i in `b` is either 0 or 1, `c` is `a[0] * b[0] + a[1] * b[1] + a[2] * b[2] + a[2] * b[2]`, `i` is 2, len(a) must be greater than 2**
