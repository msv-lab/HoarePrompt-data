Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly implement the solution according to the problem description. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of `raw_input()`**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This would cause the program to fail in Python 3 environments.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Bulb Connections**:
   - The program incorrectly processes the bulb connections. Specifically, the `ks` list is constructed in a way that includes the number of switches (`k_i`) as part of the list, which should not be included. The correct approach is to skip the first element of each line (which is `k_i`).

3. **Incorrect Conversion of Switch States**:
   - The program converts the switch states using a loop that divides `i` by 2, which is not necessary. A more straightforward approach is to use bitwise operations to convert the integer to a binary representation.

4. **Incorrect Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to count the number of "on" switches for a given bulb, but it does not correctly handle the modulo 2 operation. The function should return the count of "on" switches modulo 2, not just the sum of products.

5. **Incorrect Filtering of Switch Combinations**:
   - The program filters switch combinations in a way that may not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the `s2` list is updated in a way that may not preserve the correct combinations.

### Correct Approach:

A correct implementation should:
- Read input using `input()` for Python 3 compatibility.
- Correctly parse the bulb connections and ignore the first element of each line.
- Use bitwise operations to generate all possible switch states.
- Implement a function to count the number of "on" switches for each bulb and check if it matches the required parity.
- Count and return the number of valid switch combinations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
N, M = map(int, input().split())
bulbs = []
for _ in range(M):
    k, *s = map(int, input().split())
    bulbs.append((k, s))
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

def count_on(switches, bulb):
    count = 0
    for switch in bulb:
        count += switches[switch - 1]
    return count % 2

valid_combinations = 0
for i in range(2 ** N):
    switches = [int(bit) for bit in bin(i)[2:].zfill(N)]
    if all(count_on(switches, bulbs[j][1]) == p[j] for j in range(M)):
        valid_combinations += 1

print(valid_combinations)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program meets the problem description by correctly handling input, generating all possible switch states, and counting the valid combinations.
