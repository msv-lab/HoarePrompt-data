Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. Here are the key issues:

1. **Python Version Compatibility**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This will cause the program to fail when run in a Python 3 environment, which is the current standard.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to multiply corresponding elements of two lists and sum them up. However, this does not correctly implement the logic required to check the parity (odd or even) of the number of "on" switches for each bulb according to the given `p_i` values. The function should count the number of "on" switches and then check if this count is congruent to `p_i` modulo 2.

3. **Incorrect State Annotations**: The annotations provided do not accurately reflect the intended state of the program. For example, the annotation states that `b` represents the configuration of M bulbs, but in the context of `func_1`, `b` is actually a list representing the state of the switches. This confusion further indicates that the logic in `func_1` is not correctly implemented.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description and the annotations do not support its correctness. Therefore, the final assessment remains **False**.
