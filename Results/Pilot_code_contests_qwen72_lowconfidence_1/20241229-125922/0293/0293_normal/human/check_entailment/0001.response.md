Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the input correctly for Python 3. The function `raw_input()` used in the program is specific to Python 2, but the current standard is Python 3, which uses `input()`. This discrepancy will cause the program to fail when run in a Python 3 environment.

Additionally, the way the program processes the switch states and checks the conditions for lighting the bulbs is flawed. Specifically, the function `func_1` multiplies corresponding elements of two lists and sums them up, which does not correctly implement the logic required to check the parity (odd or even) of the number of "on" switches for each bulb according to the given `p_i` values.

For example, consider the input:
```
2 2
2 1 2
1 2
0 1
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program's logic for checking the conditions for lighting the bulbs is incorrect, leading to potentially wrong outputs for this and similar cases.
