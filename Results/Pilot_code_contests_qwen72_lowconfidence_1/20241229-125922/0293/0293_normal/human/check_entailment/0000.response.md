Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the input correctly due to the use of `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. This will cause the program to fail in environments where Python 3 is used, which is the current standard. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not work as expected in Python 3 environments.
