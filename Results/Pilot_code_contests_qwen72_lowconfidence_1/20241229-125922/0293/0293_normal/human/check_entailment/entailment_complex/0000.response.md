Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution according to the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Parsing of Input:**
   - The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, you should use `input()`.
   - The parsing of the input is not done correctly. Specifically, the first line of each bulb's connection (`k_1 s_{11} s_{12} ... s_{1k_1}`) is parsed into a list `ks2`, but the first element `k_1` (which is the number of switches connected to the bulb) is not used effectively. Instead, it is treated as part of the switch indices, which leads to incorrect processing.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Switch States:**
   - The program constructs a list `t` to represent the state of the switches for each combination of "on" and "off" states. However, the way it constructs this list is incorrect. The list `t` should be constructed directly from the binary representation of the number `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `2^N - 1`), but the program uses a division and modulo operation that is not efficient and may lead to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Bulb States:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine whether a given switch configuration lights up a particular bulb based on the parity requirement `p_i`. However, the function simply sums the products of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`, which does not match the required logic. The function should count the number of "on" switches connected to the bulb and check if this count is congruent to `p_i` modulo 2.

4. **Incorrect Filtering of Valid Configurations:**
   - The program attempts to filter valid switch configurations by checking if the result of `func_1` is congruent to `p_i` modulo 2. However, due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, this filtering is also incorrect.

### Correct Implementation
To fix the program, we need to ensure that the input is parsed correctly, the switch states are represented correctly, and the bulb states are calculated correctly based on the parity requirement. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
N, M = map(int, input().split())
bulbs = []
for _ in range(M):
    switches = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k = switches[0]
    switches = switches[1:]
    bulbs.append(switches)
parity = list(map(int, input().split()))

def is_bulb_lit(switch_state, bulb, p):
    count = sum(switch_state[switch-1] for switch in bulb)
    return count % 2 == p

valid_configs = 0
for i in range(2 ** N):
    switch_state = [(i >> j) & 1 for j in range(N)]
    if all(is_bulb_lit(switch_state, bulb, p) for bulb, p in zip(bulbs, parity)):
        valid_configs += 1

print(valid_configs)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The first line reads `N` and `M`.
   - The next `M` lines read the connections for each bulb, storing the switch indices in the `bulbs` list.
   - The last line reads the parity requirements for each bulb.

2. **Switch State Representation:**
   - For each possible combination of switch states (from 0 to `2^N - 1`), the switch state is represented as a list of 0s and 1s using bit manipulation.

3. **Bulb State Calculation:**
   - The function `is_bulb_lit` checks if the number of "on" switches connected to a bulb is congruent to the parity requirement `p` modulo 2.

4. **Filtering Valid Configurations:**
   - The program iterates through all possible switch configurations and counts those that light up all the bulbs.

This corrected program correctly implements the solution according to the problem description.
