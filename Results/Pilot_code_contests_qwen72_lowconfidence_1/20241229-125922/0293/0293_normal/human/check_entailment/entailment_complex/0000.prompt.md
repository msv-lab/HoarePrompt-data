You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have N switches with "on" and "off" state, and M bulbs. The switches are numbered 1 to N, and the bulbs are numbered 1 to M.

Bulb i is connected to k_i switches: Switch s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., and s_{ik_i}. It is lighted when the number of switches that are "on" among these switches is congruent to p_i modulo 2.

How many combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches light all the bulbs?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 10
* 1 \leq k_i \leq N
* 1 \leq s_{ij} \leq N
* s_{ia} \neq s_{ib} (a \neq b)
* p_i is 0 or 1.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
k_1 s_{11} s_{12} ... s_{1k_1}
:
k_M s_{M1} s_{M2} ... s_{Mk_M}
p_1 p_2 ... p_M


Output

Print the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches that light all the bulbs.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(N, M) = map(int, raw_input().split())
ks = []
for i in range(M):
    ks2 = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ks.append(ks2)
pm = map(int, raw_input().split())
plist = []
for i in ks:
    t = [0] * N
    ini = 1
    for j in i:
        if ini == 1:
            ini = 0
            continue
        else:
            t[j - 1] = 1
    plist.append(t)
slist = []
for i in range(2 ** N):
    t = []
    for j in range(N):
        t.append(i % 2)
        i = i / 2
    slist.append(t)
r = 0
for p in plist:
    s2 = []
    for s in slist:
        if func_1(p, s) % 2 == pm[r]:
            s2.append(s)
    r = r + 1
    slist = s2
print(len(slist))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are lists where a represents the configuration of N switches (each element is either 0 or 1 indicating "off" or "on"), and b represents the configuration of M bulbs (each element is a list containing the switch indices connected to the bulb followed by the parity requirement p_i which is 0 or 1). The lengths of a and b satisfy 1 <= len(a) <= 10 and 1 <= len(b) <= 10, respectively. Each switch index in b is an integer between 1 and len(a), inclusive, and each p_i in b is either 0 or 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        c += a[i] * b[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list of N switches where 1 <= len(a) <= 10, `b` is a list of M bulbs where 1 <= len(b) <= 10, each switch index in `b` is an integer between 1 and len(a), inclusive, each p_i in `b` is either 0 or 1, `c` is the sum of the products of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`, `i` is len(a) - 1.
    return c
    #The program returns the sum of the products of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b`. Each element in `b` is an integer between 1 and len(a), inclusive, and each p_i in `b` is either 0 or 1. The length of `a` is between 1 and 10, and the length of `b` is between 1 and 10.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of integers (0 or 1) representing the state of N switches, and `b` is a list of integers where each element corresponds to a bulb's requirement (0 or 1). The function returns the sum of the products of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`. However, the provided code and annotations suggest a mismatch in the intended functionality and the actual implementation. The code currently sums the products of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`, but the intended functionality described in the annotations suggests that `b` should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains switch indices and a parity requirement. The current implementation does not handle the structure of `b` as described in the annotations, and thus does not correctly determine the number of bulbs that are turned on based on the switch configurations and their parity requirements. The function returns an integer value, which is the sum of the products of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
