Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Bulb Requirements**: The function `func_1` is intended to check if a given switch configuration satisfies the parity requirement for a bulb. However, the function `func_1` incorrectly sums the products of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`. This does not match the problem's requirement, which states that a bulb is lit if the number of "on" switches among its connected switches is congruent to `p_i` modulo 2.

2. **Misinterpretation of Input**: The input parsing and processing of the switch and bulb connections are not handled correctly. The list `plist` is constructed in a way that does not accurately represent the connections between switches and bulbs. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the fact that each bulb has a list of connected switches and a parity requirement.

3. **Incorrect State Representation**: The list `slist` is used to generate all possible combinations of switch states. However, the way it is constructed and updated does not correctly reflect the problem's constraints. The function `func_1` is called to filter `slist` based on the parity requirement, but this filtering is done incorrectly.

4. **Output Calculation**: The final count of valid switch configurations is calculated by the length of `slist`, but due to the issues mentioned above, this count may be incorrect.

To illustrate, consider the first example provided:

- **Input**:
  ```
  2 2
  2 1 2
  1 2
  0 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 1

The correct solution should count the number of switch configurations that satisfy both bulbs' requirements. The current code does not correctly implement this logic, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
