Final: **False**

Reasoning:

1. **Python 2 vs Python 3**: The original assessment correctly points out that the use of `raw_input()` is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This will indeed cause the program to fail in Python 3 environments, which is the current standard. Therefore, the program is not portable and does not work as expected in modern Python environments.

2. **Functionality Mismatch**: The annotated version of the code highlights a significant issue with the `func_1` function. According to the annotations, the function is supposed to handle a list of lists where each sublist contains switch indices and a parity requirement. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` simply sums the products of corresponding elements from two lists `a` and `b`. This does not align with the problem description, which requires checking the parity of the number of "on" switches connected to each bulb.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Bulb Requirements**: The program does not correctly handle the bulb requirements. The `func_1` function should compute the parity of the number of "on" switches for each bulb and compare it to the required parity (`p_i`). The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description and the annotations support the conclusion that the program is incorrect. Therefore, the final assessment remains **False**.
