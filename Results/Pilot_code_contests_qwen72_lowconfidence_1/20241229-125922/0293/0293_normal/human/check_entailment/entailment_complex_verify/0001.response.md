Final: **False**

### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling Issue**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the use of `raw_input()` is specific to Python 2. In a Python 3 environment, the correct function to use is `input()`. This alone would cause the program to fail when run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to check whether the number of "on" switches for a given bulb is congruent to the specified parity `p_i` modulo 2. However, the current implementation of `func_1` simply multiplies corresponding elements of two lists and sums them up. This does not correctly implement the required logic.
   - The correct logic should count the number of "on" switches for a given bulb and check if this count is congruent to `p_i` modulo 2. The current implementation does not perform this check correctly.

3. **Annotations and Code Mismatch**:
   - The annotations suggest that `b` should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains switch indices and a parity requirement. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` treats `b` as a simple list of integers, which is incorrect.
   - The annotations also mention that `b` should contain the switch indices and the parity requirement, but the function `func_1` does not handle this structure correctly.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     2 2
     2 1 2
     1 2
     0 1
     ```
     The expected output is `1`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` and the overall logic in the program do not correctly handle the parity check, leading to potentially incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the problem description due to the issues with input handling and the incorrect logic in `func_1`. The annotations further confirm that the intended functionality is not implemented correctly. Therefore, the final assessment remains **False**.
