Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where the highest throwing damage (`b_i`) is less than the highest wielding damage (`a_i`). In such a case, the program will still prefer using the throwing attack, which might not be optimal.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 10
5 4
5 4
```
In this case, the optimal solution would be to use the wielding attack (`a_i = 5`) twice, resulting in 2 attacks. However, the program will use the throwing attack (`b_i = 4`) first, and then it will need to use the wielding attack to finish off the remaining health, resulting in 3 attacks. This is suboptimal and does not meet the problem's requirement of finding the minimum number of attacks.
