According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. If `h` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `h` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9. Since `h` is already specified to be within this range, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is 0, `h` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9, `kl` is a list containing 2 * `n` tuples, each pair (a_i, b_i) contributes two tuples `(b_i, 0)` and `(a_i, 1)` to the list, sorted in descending order, `i` is 0**
