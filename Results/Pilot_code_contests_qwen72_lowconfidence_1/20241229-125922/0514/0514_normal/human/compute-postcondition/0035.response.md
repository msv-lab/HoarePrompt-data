Postcondition: ***`n` is 0 or 1 initially, `h` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9, `kl` is a list containing 2 * `n` tuples, each pair (a_i, b_i) contributes two tuples `(b_i, 0)` and `(a_i, 1)` to the list, sorted in descending order, `i` is 0 or 1, `k` is `kl[i]`. If `k[1] == 0`, then `n` is now 1 or 2, `h` is now `h - k[0]`, `kl` remains the same list of tuples, and `i` is now 1 or 2, with `k` remaining as `kl[i-1]`. Otherwise, `n` is updated to `n + (h + k[0] - 1) / k[0]`, `h` remains within the original range, `kl` remains the same list of tuples, `i` is 0 or 1, and `k` is `kl[i]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
