The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` was initially 0 or 1, after the increment, `n` will be 1 or 2, respectively. The other variables (`h`, `kl`, `i`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is now 1 or 2, `h` is now `h - k[0]`, `kl` remains the same list of tuples, `i` is now 1 or 2, `k` remains `kl[i-1]`**
