Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `h` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9, there are `n` pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `kl` is a list containing 2 * `n` tuples, each pair (a_i, b_i) contributes two tuples `(b_i, 0)` and `(a_i, 1)` to the list, `i` is `n - 1`.**
