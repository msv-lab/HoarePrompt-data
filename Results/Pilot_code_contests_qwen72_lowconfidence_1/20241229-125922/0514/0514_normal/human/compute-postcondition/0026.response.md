Output State: **`n` is `h/k[0] + 1 - 1/k[0]`, `h` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9, `kl` is a list containing 2 * `n` tuples, each pair (a_i, b_i) contributes two tuples `(b_i, 0)` and `(a_i, 1)` to the list, sorted in descending order, `i` is 0, `k` is `kl[0]`, and `k[1]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
