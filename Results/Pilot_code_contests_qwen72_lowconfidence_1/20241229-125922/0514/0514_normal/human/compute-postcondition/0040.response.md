The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Initially, `n` is either 0 or 1, so after the increment, `n` will be either 1 or 2. The other variables (`h`, `kl`, `i`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is either 1 or 2, `h` is `h - k[0]`, `kl` is a list containing 2 * (initial `n`) tuples, each pair `(a_i, b_i)` contributes two tuples `(b_i, 0)` and `(a_i, 1)` to the list, sorted in descending order, `i` is 1 or 2, `k` is `kl[i-1]`**
