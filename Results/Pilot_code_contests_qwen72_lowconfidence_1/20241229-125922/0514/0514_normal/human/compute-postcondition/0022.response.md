The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `h` is `h - b_0`, `kl` is a list containing 2 * `n` tuples, each pair (a_i, b_i) contributes two tuples `(b_i, 0)` and `(a_i, 1)` to the list, sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `k` is `(b_0, 0)`**
