The code snippet `a, b = [int(e) for e in raw_input().split()]` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer, assigning these integers to `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `h` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9
- There are `n` pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9
- `kl` is `[(b, 0), (a, 1)]`
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new input values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9, there are `n` pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `kl` is `[(b, 0), (a, 1)]`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**
