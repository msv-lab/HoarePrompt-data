The code snippet `kl.append((a, 1))` adds a new tuple `(a, 1)` to the list `kl`. This modifies the content of `kl` while leaving all other variables unchanged.

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `h` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9
- There are `n` pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9
- `kl` is `[(b, 0), (a, 1), (b, 0)]`
- `a` is the first integer from the input
- `b` is the second integer from the input

After executing the code:
- `kl` now includes the additional tuple `(a, 1)`, making it `kl = [(b, 0), (a, 1), (b, 0), (a, 1)]`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9, there are `n` pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `kl` is `[(b, 0), (a, 1), (b, 0), (a, 1)]`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**
