The code initializes an empty list `kl`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `h`, or the pairs of integers (a_i, b_i).

Output State: **`n` and `h` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9, There are `n` pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `kl` is an empty list.**
