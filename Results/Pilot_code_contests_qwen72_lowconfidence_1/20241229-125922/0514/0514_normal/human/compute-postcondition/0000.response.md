The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `h`. The values of `n` and `h` are now determined by the input. The initial conditions regarding the ranges of `N` and `H` remain valid, and the description of the pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `h` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9, There are `n` pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the damage dealt by wielding and throwing each katana, respectively.**
