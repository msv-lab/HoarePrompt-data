Postcondition: ***`n` is 0 or 1 initially, `h` must be greater than 0, `kl` is a list containing 2 * `n` tuples, each pair (a_i, b_i) contributes two tuples `(b_i, 0)` and `(a_i, 1)` to the list, sorted in descending order, `i` is 0 or 1, `k` is `kl[i]`. If `k[1] == 0`, `n` is either 1 or 2, `h` is `h - k[0]`, and `k` is `kl[i-1]`. Otherwise, `n` is updated to `n + (h + k[0] - 1) / k[0]`, `h` remains greater than 0, `kl` still contains 2 * `n` tuples, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
