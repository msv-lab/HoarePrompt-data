The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently executing. Since no other operations are performed on the variables, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `n + (h + k[0] - 1) / k[0]`, `h` is greater than 0, `kl` is a list containing 2 * `n` tuples, each pair (a_i, b_i) contributes two tuples `(b_i, 0)` and `(a_i, 1)` to the list, sorted in descending order, `i` is 0 or 1, `k` is `kl[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
