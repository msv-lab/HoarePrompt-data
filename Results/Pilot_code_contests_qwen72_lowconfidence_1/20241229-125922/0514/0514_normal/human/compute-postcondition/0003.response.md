The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. These values are taken from the input and converted to integers. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `h`, and `kl`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `h` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9, there are `n` pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `kl` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**
