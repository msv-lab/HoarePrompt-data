The value of `n` is set to 0. All other variables (`h`, `kl`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `h` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9, `kl` is a list containing 2 * `n` tuples, each pair (a_i, b_i) contributes two tuples `(b_i, 0)` and `(a_i, 1)` to the list, sorted in descending order, `i` is `n - 1`.**
