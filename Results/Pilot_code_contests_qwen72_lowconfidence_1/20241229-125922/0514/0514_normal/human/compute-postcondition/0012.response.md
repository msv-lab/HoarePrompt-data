The code snippet `kl.append((b, 0))` adds a new tuple `(b, 0)` to the list `kl`. Given that `kl` initially contains `[(b, 0), (a, 1), (b, 0), (a, 1)]`, after executing the code, `kl` will contain `[(b, 0), (a, 1), (b, 0), (a, 1), (b, 0)]`.

The values of `n`, `i`, `h`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 10^9, there are `n` pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `kl` is `[(b, 0), (a, 1), (b, 0), (a, 1), (b, 0)]`, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input**
