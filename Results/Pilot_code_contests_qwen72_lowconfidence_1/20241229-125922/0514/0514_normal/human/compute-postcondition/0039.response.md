The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 0 or 1, after incrementing, `i` becomes 1 or 2, respectively. The other variables (`n`, `h`, `kl`, `k`) are not affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0 or 1, `h` is `h - k[0]`, `kl` is a list containing 2 * `n` tuples, each pair `(a_i, b_i)` contributes two tuples `(b_i, 0)` and `(a_i, 1)` to the list, sorted in descending order, `i` is 1 or 2, `k` is `kl[i-1]`**
