Output State: **`n` is the final count of processed elements, `h` is reduced to 0 or a non-positive integer, `kl` remains the same list of tuples as initially, `i` is the index of the last processed element in `kl` plus one, if the loop breaks due to `k[1] == 1`, `n` is updated to `n + (h + k[0] - 1) / k[0]` and `i` is the index of the tuple where `k[1] == 1`.**
