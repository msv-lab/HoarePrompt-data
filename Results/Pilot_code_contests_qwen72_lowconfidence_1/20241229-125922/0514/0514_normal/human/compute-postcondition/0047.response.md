The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `H`, and a list of `N` tuples `(a_i, b_i)`. `N` and `H` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9. Each tuple `(a_i, b_i)` consists of two integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the damage dealt by wielding and throwing each katana, respectively.

The function returns the minimum number of katanas required to defeat a monster with health `H`, considering both the wield and throw damage for each katana.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `N`, `H`, and a list of `N` tuples `(a_i, b_i)`. It returns the minimum number of katanas required to defeat a monster with health `H` by dealing damage using both the wield and throw options for each katana.**
