Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters: `string` and `substring`. The function uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the `substring` within the `string`. If the `substring` is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the end position of the `substring` by adding its length to the start position and returns a tuple containing the `substring`, its start position, and its end position (which is calculated as `end - 1` to follow Python's indexing convention where the end index is usually exclusive).

This program correctly implements the described functionality for finding the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. It handles the case where the substring is not found by returning `None`, and it accurately reports the start and end positions of the substring when it is found.

The calculation of the end position as `end - 1` is also correct because, in Python, the end index in slice notation is exclusive, meaning it points to the position right after the last character of the substring. This convention is followed here to provide accurate end indices for the found substrings.

Since the program behaves as expected for all potential cases, including finding the first occurrence of a substring and returning `None` when the substring is not found, it can be considered correct.
