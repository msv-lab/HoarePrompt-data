Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it is expecting two parameters, an array `arr` and a `target`, but it does not use the `target` in the function. The function should only take an array as input and find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the array has only one element. In this case, the function will not return anything meaningful because it does not handle this edge case. 

Another issue with the function is that it does not consider the case when two elements in the array are the same, in which case the minimum difference should be 0. 

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return float('inf')
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```
