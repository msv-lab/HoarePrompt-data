Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's why:

1. The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2. If so, it returns 0, because there are not enough elements to compare.
2. The function then sorts the array `arr` in ascending order.
3. It initializes `min_diff` to positive infinity, which will store the minimum difference found so far.
4. The function then iterates over the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements (`arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`).
5. If the calculated difference `diff` is less than the current `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff` with the new value.
6. After iterating over all pairs of adjacent elements, the function returns the minimum difference found, which is stored in `min_diff`.

This approach ensures that the function finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the array, because the differences are calculated between adjacent elements in the sorted array. The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the array.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input cases. Since the function works as expected for all potential cases and the provided examples, and there are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle, the correctness of the function is **True**.
