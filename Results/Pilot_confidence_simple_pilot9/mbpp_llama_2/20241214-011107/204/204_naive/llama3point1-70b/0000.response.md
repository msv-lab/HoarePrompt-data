Correctness: **True**

The given program checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a list of months that have 31 days (`months_31_days`) and returns `True` if the input month number is in this list, and `False` otherwise. 

The months that have 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which are correctly included in the `months_31_days` list.

For every potential input, the function will work as expected:
- For months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), the function will return `True`.
- For months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), the function will return `False`.
- For February (2), the function will return `False`, which is correct because February has 28 or 29 days, not 31.
- For invalid month numbers (less than 1 or greater than 12), the function will return `False`, which might be considered correct in the context of this problem, as the problem statement does not specify what should happen with invalid inputs.

Since the function behaves as expected for all valid and expected invalid inputs, it is considered correct according to the provided problem description.
