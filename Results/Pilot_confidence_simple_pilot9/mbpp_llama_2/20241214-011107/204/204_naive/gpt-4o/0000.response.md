Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. It then checks if the input month is in this set and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

The function handles all 12 months correctly:

- Months with 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12) are all included in the `months_with_31_days` set.
- Months with fewer than 31 days: February (2), April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11) are not included in the `months_with_31_days` set.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the function works as expected for various inputs.

Overall, the function `func_1` accurately checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not, covering all possible cases.
