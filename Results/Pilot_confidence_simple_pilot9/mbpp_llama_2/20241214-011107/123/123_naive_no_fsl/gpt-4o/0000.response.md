Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input, and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list in the tuple contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`. 

This is achieved through the use of Python's list slicing feature, where `lst[:L]` returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and `lst[L:]` returns a new list containing the remaining elements of `lst`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for various inputs. Additionally, the function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `L` is 0 (in which case the first list is empty and the second list is the entire original list) and when `L` is equal to the length of `lst` (in which case the first list is the entire original list and the second list is empty).

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all possible inputs.
