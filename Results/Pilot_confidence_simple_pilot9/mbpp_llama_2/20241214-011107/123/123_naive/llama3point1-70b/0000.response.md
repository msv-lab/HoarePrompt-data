Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into two parts based on the given integer `L`. It returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list contains the first `L` elements of the original list (`lst[:L]`), and the second list contains the remaining elements (`lst[L:]`).

This function handles all potential cases correctly:

- If `L` is equal to the length of the list, the function returns a tuple with the original list and an empty list.
- If `L` is greater than the length of the list, Python's list slicing will simply return the entire list as the first part and an empty list as the second part.
- If `L` is less than the length of the list, the function correctly splits the list into two parts based on `L`.
- If `L` is 0, the function returns a tuple with an empty list and the original list.
- If the input list is empty, the function will return a tuple with two empty lists if `L` is 0 or greater, which is the expected behavior.

The function does not check if `L` is negative, but in Python, negative indices in list slicing refer to positions from the end of the list. However, in the context of splitting a list into two parts of specified length, negative `L` might not be a valid input. But even in such cases, Python will interpret `L` as a position from the end if it's negative, and the function will still work, though it might not be the intended behavior.

Overall, the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, making it a correct implementation according to the problem description.
