Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into sublists at every `n`-th element. This is achieved using list slicing with a step of `n` (`lst[i::n]`) and iterating over the range of `n` to get the starting index `i` for each slice.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates `n` slices of the original list `lst`.
- Each slice starts at index `i` and includes every `n`-th element thereafter.
- The `range(n)` ensures that `i` takes on values from 0 to `n-1`, thus covering all starting points for the slices.

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n = 3`, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`, which are the sublists obtained by splitting `lst` at every 3rd element.

This approach correctly handles lists of any length and value of `n`, as the list comprehension and slicing are dynamic and will accommodate various inputs without requiring explicit edge case handling. Therefore, the function meets the problem description's requirements.
