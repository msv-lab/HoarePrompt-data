Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(input_list)` takes an input list and returns its tuple equivalent using the built-in `tuple()` function in Python. This function handles every potential case as specified in the problem description. 

Here are some reasons why the function works as expected:
- It correctly converts a list to a tuple, regardless of the list's size or the data types of its elements.
- It handles empty lists by returning an empty tuple.
- It does not modify the original list, only converting it to a tuple.
- It does not have any specific requirements for the input list, such as it having to be sorted or containing only unique elements.

Since we cannot think of any potential case where this function does not work as expected according to the problem description, we conclude that the function is correct.
