Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct. It takes two tuples as input and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. 

The code uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the two tuples in parallel, and a generator expression to perform the subtraction operation. The result is then converted back to a tuple using the `tuple` function.

This approach ensures that the program works correctly for tuples of any length, as long as they have the same length. The `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, but since the problem description implies that the tuples have the same length, this is not a concern.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the program works correctly for various inputs, and there are no apparent edge cases that the program is not handling. 

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))`, the program will correctly return `(-3, -3, -3)`. 

In general, the program will work correctly for any two tuples of the same length, regardless of the values or the sign of the numbers. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
