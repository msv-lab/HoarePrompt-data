Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` is designed to add a given tuple to a given list. This function works by converting the tuple into a list using `list(input_tuple)` and then concatenating it with the input list using the `+` operator.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly:

- It correctly handles the addition of a tuple to an empty list: `func_1([], (1, 2, 3))` returns `[1, 2, 3]`.
- It correctly handles the addition of a tuple to a non-empty list: `func_1([4, 5], (1, 2, 3))` returns `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.
- It correctly handles the addition of an empty tuple to a list: `func_1([4, 5], ())` returns `[4, 5]`.

The function returns the result as a new list, leaving the original list unchanged, which is consistent with the typical behavior of a functional programming approach.

Since the function correctly adds a tuple to a list in all considered cases, and does not modify the original list but instead returns a new one, it meets the problem description's requirements. Therefore, the code is correct for all identified potential cases.
