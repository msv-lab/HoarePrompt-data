Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It is designed to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, and as soon as it encounters the target element, it returns the index of that element. If the target element is not found in the array, the function returns -1.

This approach works correctly for a sorted array because all occurrences of the same element will be adjacent to each other due to the sorting. Therefore, by scanning from the end, the function will find the last occurrence of the target element.

The function handles the following cases correctly:

- The target element is present in the array: It returns the last position of the target element.
- The target element is not present in the array: It returns -1.
- The array contains duplicate elements: It returns the last position of the target element.
- The array is empty: It returns -1, which is the expected behavior.

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly, it is considered a correct implementation of the problem description.
