Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The function utilizes the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple.

This function is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. It handles tuples of any size and can find any type of element (not limited to integers) within the tuple. The `count` method is also case-sensitive and type-sensitive, meaning it treats 'a' and 'A' as different elements, and '1' and 1 as different elements.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for both existing and non-existing elements in the tuple. The function is robust and can handle a wide range of inputs without exceptions or errors.

In order to verify the correctness, we would need to try to think of edge cases or examples where the code might fail, such as:

- Empty tuple: `func_1((), 5)` should return `0`, which it does.
- Element not in tuple: `func_1((1, 2, 3), 4)` should return `0`, which it does.
- Element in tuple multiple times: `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), 2)` should return `2`, which it does.
- Large tuple: `func_1((1,)*1000, 1)` should return `1000`, which it does.

All these edge cases are handled correctly by the `func_1` function.
