Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. The function uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to compare the two numbers. The XOR operator returns a result where each bit is set to 1 only if the corresponding bits in the two numbers are different.

The function then checks two conditions:

1. `xor_result!= 0`: This condition checks if the two numbers are not identical, i.e., they differ at at least one bit position.
2. `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`: This condition checks if the XOR result has exactly one bit set to 1. This is done by subtracting 1 from the XOR result and performing a bitwise AND operation with the original XOR result. If the result is 0, it means that the XOR result has only one bit set to 1.

The function returns `True` if both conditions are met, indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input cases. The function works correctly because it uses the properties of bitwise XOR and AND operations to check the difference between the two numbers at the bit level.

For example, let's consider the case where `a = 5` (binary: 101) and `b = 1` (binary: 001). The XOR result is 100 (binary), which has exactly one bit set to 1. The function correctly returns `True` in this case.

Similarly, for `a = 2` (binary: 010) and `b = 4` (binary: 100), the XOR result is 110 (binary), which has two bits set to 1. The function correctly returns `False` in this case.

Since the function works correctly for all the provided unit tests and the logic is sound, it is correct.
