Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. It uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to find the bits that differ between the two numbers. The `bin` function is used to convert the result to a binary string, and the `count` method is used to count the number of '1' bits in the binary string.

This function works correctly because the XOR operator has the following properties:

- `a ^ a = 0` (i.e., XOR of a number with itself is 0)
- `a ^ 0 = a` (i.e., XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself)
- `a ^ b = b ^ a` (i.e., XOR is commutative)
- `a ^ (b ^ c) = (a ^ b) ^ c` (i.e., XOR is associative)

These properties ensure that the XOR operation will only have '1' bits in the positions where the corresponding bits of the two input numbers differ.

If the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, the binary representation of the XOR result will have exactly one '1' bit. Therefore, the `count` method will return 1, and the function will return `True`.

If the two numbers differ at more or less than one bit position, the binary representation of the XOR result will have more or less than one '1' bit, respectively. In these cases, the `count` method will return a value other than 1, and the function will return `False`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the function does not work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
