Correctness: **True**

The given Python program checks whether two input numbers differ at exactly one bit position by performing a bitwise XOR operation (`num1 ^ num2`) and then counting the number of '1' bits in the result using `bin().count('1')`. This approach works because XORing two numbers will result in '1' bits only at positions where the corresponding bits in the two input numbers are different. If the count of '1' bits is 1, it means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

- When the numbers are identical (e.g., `func_1(5, 5)`), the function correctly returns `False` because `5 ^ 5` equals 0, and `bin(0)` contains no '1' bits.
- When the numbers differ at more than one bit position (e.g., `func_1(5, 7)`), the function correctly returns `False` because `5 ^ 7` equals 2, and `bin(2)` contains one '1' bit, but this would not be the case for all examples where numbers differ at more than one bit (e.g., `func_1(1, 6)` where `1 ^ 6` equals 7, and `bin(7)` contains three '1' bits, the function correctly returns `False`).
- When the numbers are negatives or zeros (e.g., `func_1(-5, 5)` or `func_1(0, 1)`), Python's built-in `^` operator works with negative numbers and zero by treating the numbers as their two's complement representations. The function handles these cases correctly because the XOR operation and bit counting work as expected in these scenarios.

However, I should note that the function might behave unexpectedly if non-integer inputs are provided, as it implicitly relies on the properties of integer binary representation. Nonetheless, given the problem description and common assumptions about such problems (i.e., inputs are integers), the provided program correctly implements the required functionality for all integer inputs.
