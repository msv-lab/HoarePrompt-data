Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, it means the number is odd, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(12) == False`, `assert func_1(7) == True`, and `assert func_1(10) == False`, all pass and demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs.

Upon examining the code, it appears that the function handles all potential cases correctly. It correctly identifies odd numbers (e.g., 7, 3, 1) and even numbers (e.g., 12, 10, 2). The function's logic is simple and straightforward, making it easy to verify its correctness.

Since the function seems to work correctly for all possible inputs, and there are no obvious edge cases that it fails to handle, the correctness of the program is **True**.
