Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It uses the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radial distance `r` and the `math.atan2` function to calculate the azimuthal angle `phi`. 

Here's why this program is correct:

- The `math.hypot(x, y)` function returns the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. This correctly calculates the radial distance `r` in polar coordinates.

- The `math.atan2(y, x)` function returns the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`. This correctly calculates the azimuthal angle `phi` in polar coordinates.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

- For points on the x-axis (y=0), `math.atan2(y, x)` returns 0 for positive x and pi for negative x, which is correct.

- For points on the y-axis (x=0), `math.atan2(y, x)` returns pi/2 for positive y and -pi/2 for negative y, which is correct.

- For points in the origin (x=0, y=0), `math.hypot(x, y)` returns 0 and `math.atan2(y, x)` returns 0, which is correct for the radial distance but the angle is arbitrary. However, the program still returns (0, 0) which is a valid representation of the origin in polar coordinates.

Therefore, the program correctly handles all potential cases and is a correct implementation of the conversion from rectangular to polar coordinates.
