Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to count the occurrences of all elements from a list in a tuple. The function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list and count its occurrences in the tuple using the `count` method.

This approach is correct and efficient for the described task. It covers all potential cases as it:
- Iterates over all elements in the list.
- For each element in the list, it counts the occurrences of that element in the tuple.
- It sums up these counts to give the total number of occurrences of the list elements in the tuple.

The function does not have any apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail according to the problem description. It handles:
- Duplicate elements in the list correctly, as the `count` method will count each occurrence of the element in the tuple regardless of how many times the element appears in the list.
- Elements in the list that are not present in the tuple, as `count` will simply return 0 for such elements.
- Empty lists or tuples, though the function's behavior in such cases is not explicitly tested, it should return 0 as expected because `sum` over an empty iterable returns 0.

Without being able to find or construct a case where the function fails to meet the problem description, the code is considered correct for its intended purpose.
