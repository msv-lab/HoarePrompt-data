Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list. The function `func_1` iterates through the list using a for loop, checking each index and its corresponding value. If an even number is found at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty lists: The function will return `True` for an empty list, as there are no odd indices to check.
- Lists with only one element: If the single element is at an odd index (i.e., index 0 is considered even), the function will return `True` if the element is odd and `False` if it is even.
- Lists with multiple elements: The function checks each odd index and returns `False` as soon as it finds an even number at an odd index.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
