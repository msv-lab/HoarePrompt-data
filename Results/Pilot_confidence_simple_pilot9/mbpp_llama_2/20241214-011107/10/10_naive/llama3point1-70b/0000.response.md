Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism, where `b` is the base of the triangle, `h` is the height of the triangle, and `l` is the length of the prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `(base * height / 2) * length`, which is exactly what the function implements.

I have analyzed the function and could not find any potential case where it does not follow the problem description. The function correctly handles all possible inputs, including positive values for `b`, `h`, and `l`. It also handles floating-point numbers and integers correctly.

For example, if we call the function with `b = 3`, `h = 4`, and `l = 5`, it correctly returns the volume of the triangular prism: `func_1(3, 4, 5) = (3 * 4 / 2) * 5 = 30`.

Since I could not find any case where the function does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
