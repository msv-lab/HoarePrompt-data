Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`. 

The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the input tuple, multiplying each element with the next one. The result is then converted to a tuple and returned.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the function. For example, when the input is `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the function correctly returns `(5, 35, 56, 80)`, which are the products of adjacent elements in the input tuple.

Additionally, the function handles the edge case where the input tuple has only one element, in which case it returns an empty tuple.

Overall, after reviewing the function and the unit tests, it appears that the function works as expected for all possible inputs, and therefore its correctness is **True**.
