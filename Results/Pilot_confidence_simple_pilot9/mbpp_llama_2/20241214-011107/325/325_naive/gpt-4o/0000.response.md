Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` to store the month numbers that have 30 days. The function then returns `True` if the given month is in the set and `False` otherwise.

The function correctly handles all possible month numbers from 1 to 12. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are all included in the set. The function will return `True` for these months and `False` for the other months, which is in line with the problem description.

The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the function. For example, the test `assert func_1(6) == True` checks that the function returns `True` for June (6), which has 30 days. Similarly, the test `assert func_1(2) == False` checks that the function returns `False` for February (2), which does not have 30 days.

Since the function correctly handles all possible cases and the unit tests validate its correctness, I conclude that the program is correct.
