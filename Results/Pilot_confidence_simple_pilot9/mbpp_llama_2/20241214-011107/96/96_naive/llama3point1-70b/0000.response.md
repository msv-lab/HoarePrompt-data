Correctness: **True**.

The given program checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function `func_1(tup)` uses a set to store the types of all elements in the tuple. Since sets only store unique elements, if all elements in the tuple have the same type, the set will only contain one element. The function then checks if the length of the set is equal to 1, which means all elements have the same type.

The code handles all potential cases correctly. It works for tuples of any size, including empty tuples (in which case it will return `False` because an empty set has a length of 0, not 1). It also handles tuples with elements of different data types, such as integers, floats, strings, and more.

For example:
- `func_1((1, 2, 3))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.
- `func_1((1, 2.3, 'a'))` returns `False` because the elements have different data types.
- `func_1(())` returns `False` because an empty tuple does not have any elements to check.

Overall, the function works as expected for all possible inputs, and therefore, it is correct.
