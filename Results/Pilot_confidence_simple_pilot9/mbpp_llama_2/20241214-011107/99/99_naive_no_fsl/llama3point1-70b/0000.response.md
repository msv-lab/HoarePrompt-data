Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly removes the characters at odd index values from a given string `s`. 

In Python, indexing starts at 0. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the string `s` with a step size of 2, starting from index 0. This means it will include characters at even indices (0, 2, 4,...) and exclude characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5,...).

For example, if the input string is "abcdef", the function will return "ace", which are the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4).

I have considered various cases, including:

- Empty string: The function will return an empty string, which is correct.
- Single character string: The function will return the character, which is correct because the single character is at index 0 (even).
- String with an even length: The function will return the correct characters.
- String with an odd length: The function will return the correct characters.

I couldn't find any case where the function does not work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
