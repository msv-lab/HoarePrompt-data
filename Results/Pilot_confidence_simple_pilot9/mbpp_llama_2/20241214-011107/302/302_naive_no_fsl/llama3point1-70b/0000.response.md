Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it does not take into account the fact that the array is sorted. The function will still work correctly for unsorted arrays, but it can be optimized for sorted arrays. 

A more efficient solution would be to use a binary search algorithm, which would have a time complexity of O(log n) compared to the O(n) time complexity of the given function.

An example where this program does not work as efficiently as expected is when the input array is a large sorted array and the target number is at the beginning of the array. In this case, the binary search algorithm would be able to find the target number much more quickly than the given function.

Here is an example of how the function could be optimized for sorted arrays:
```python
def func_1(arr, num):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == num:
            # Check if this is the first occurrence
            if mid == 0 or arr[mid - 1]!= num:
                return mid
            right = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < num:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
This optimized function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the sorted array, and then checks to make sure it's the first occurrence of the number.
