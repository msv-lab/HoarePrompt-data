Correctness: **True**.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The function simply returns the product of the length and width, which is the standard formula for calculating the area of a rectangle.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the correctness of the function for different input values. In all cases, the function returns the expected result, which is the product of the length and width.

Upon analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work as expected. The function handles positive integers as input, which is a reasonable assumption for the dimensions of a rectangle. The function does not handle negative numbers or non-integer values, but this is not mentioned in the problem description as a requirement.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and code, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected for all valid input values.
