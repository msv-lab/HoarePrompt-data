Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. This is exactly as described in the problem statement. 

Upon examination, the function works as expected for all potential cases, including positive and negative numbers, as well as zero. The function does not have any conditional statements or loops, which reduces the likelihood of it not working correctly for certain inputs. 

For example, calling `func_1(5, 10)` returns `(10, 5)`, `func_1(-5, 0)` returns `(0, -5)`, and `func_1(0, 0)` returns `(0, 0)`. All of these examples match the expected output based on the problem description. 

Since the function behaves as expected in every case and there are no conditional statements that could potentially lead to incorrect results, the program is correct.
