Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input and returns a new list where the last element of `list1` is replaced with all elements of `list2`. 

The function uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this. The expression `list1[:-1]` returns a new list containing all elements of `list1` except the last one. This new list is then concatenated with `list2` using the `+` operator, effectively replacing the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`.

All provided unit tests (`assert` statements) pass, and the function behaves as expected for different types of input lists. The function does not modify the original lists and returns a new list, which is a good practice.

In general, the function should work correctly for all possible inputs, including empty lists, lists with a single element, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with different data types. However, it's worth noting that if `list1` is an empty list, the function will simply return `list2`, which might be considered the correct behavior in this case. 

Since I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
