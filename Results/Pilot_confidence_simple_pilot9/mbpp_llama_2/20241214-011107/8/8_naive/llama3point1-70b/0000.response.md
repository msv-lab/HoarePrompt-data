Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct because it accurately removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. Here's why:

- The program first finds the index of the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(char)`, and the index of the last occurrence using `s.rfind(char)`.
- If the character is not found in the string (`first_occurrence == -1` or `last_occurrence == -1`), the program simply returns the original string.
- If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once in the string), the program replaces the character with an empty string using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, effectively removing it.
- If the first and last occurrences are different, the program uses string slicing to create a new string that excludes the first and last occurrences of the character.

The program handles edge cases, such as:
- An empty string
- A string with a single character
- A string with the character appearing multiple times
- A string with the character appearing only once

I couldn't find any examples where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
