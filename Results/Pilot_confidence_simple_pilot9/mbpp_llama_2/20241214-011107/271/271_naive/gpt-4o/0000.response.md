Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. The function first determines the number of elements in each tuple, then iterates over each position, calculating the average of values at that position across all tuples.

Here's why the function is correct:

1. **Handling tuples of different lengths is not a concern**: The function assumes that all tuples have the same length, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description. If tuples of different lengths are passed, the function would raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access an index that does not exist in the shorter tuple. However, this is not explicitly mentioned as a requirement in the problem description.

2. **Calculating averages**: The function correctly calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple by summing the values at a given position and dividing by the total number of tuples.

3. **Handling edge cases**: The function can handle edge cases such as an empty tuple (though this would raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because it tries to divide by zero) or tuples with non-numeric values (which would raise a `TypeError` because it tries to perform arithmetic operations on non-numeric values).

4. **No off-by-one errors**: The function correctly iterates over the indices of the tuples, avoiding off-by-one errors that could occur if the indices were incorrectly calculated.

5. **No incorrect assumptions**: The function does not make any incorrect assumptions about the input data, such as assuming that the tuples are sorted or that the values are integers.

In conclusion, based on the provided problem description and the examples given, the function `func_1` appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
