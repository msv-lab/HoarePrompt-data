Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function works as follows:
- It first converts the input number to a string to easily access each digit.
- It then calculates the length of the string (number of digits) and initializes a sum variable to 0.
- The function iterates over each digit in the string, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of the number of digits (`num_len`), and adds this value to the sum.
- Finally, the function checks if the sum is equal to the original number and returns `True` if they are equal (indicating the number is an Armstrong number) and `False` otherwise.

This logic is correct for all positive integers. For example, the number 371 is an Armstrong number since 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371. The function correctly identifies this and similar cases.

I could not find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. It correctly handles single-digit numbers (which are all Armstrong numbers by definition), multi-digit numbers, and it correctly identifies Armstrong numbers according to the formula provided. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
