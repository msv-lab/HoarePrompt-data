Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1(num)`, checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The function first converts the number into a string `num_str` to easily get the number of digits `num_len` in the number.
2. It then initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will store the sum of the digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
3. The function then iterates over each digit in the string representation of the number, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and adds it to the `sum`.
4. Finally, the function checks if the `sum` is equal to the original number `num`. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This code correctly implements the definition of an Armstrong number and should work for all positive integers. For example, the number 371 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371, and the function correctly returns `True` for this input.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.
