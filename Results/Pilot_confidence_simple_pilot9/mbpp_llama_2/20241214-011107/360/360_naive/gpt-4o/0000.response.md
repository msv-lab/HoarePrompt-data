Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly determines the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. It iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum encountered so far. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct for all potential cases:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), ensuring that any sum of a sublist will be greater than this initial value. It also initializes `max_list` to an empty list, which will be updated as soon as it finds the first sublist.

2. **Iteration**: It iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`. For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements (`current_sum = sum(sublist)`).

3. **Update**: If the sum of the current sublist (`current_sum`) is greater than the maximum sum found so far (`max_sum`), it updates `max_sum` to be `current_sum` and `max_list` to be the current sublist.

4. **Return**: After checking all sublists, it returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum of elements.

The function handles various cases correctly:

- **Multiple sublists**: It correctly handles cases where there are multiple sublists and identifies the one with the highest sum.
- **Single sublist**: If there's only one sublist, it correctly returns that sublist.
- **Empty list of lists**: Although not explicitly tested, if the input is an empty list of lists, it will return an empty list because it doesn't encounter any sublists to update `max_list`.
- **Negative numbers**: It handles cases where sublists contain negative numbers or zeros, correctly calculating their sums and identifying the sublist with the highest total.

Given the provided assertions and the logical structure of the function, it appears to correctly implement the described functionality for all potential cases.
