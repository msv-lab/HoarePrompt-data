Correctness: **True**.

The given program `func_1(lists)` is designed to return the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. The function utilizes Python's built-in `max()` function with `key=sum`, which effectively finds the list with the maximum sum of elements.

This program handles various potential cases correctly:

1. **Lists with Positive Numbers**: If all lists contain only positive numbers, the function will correctly identify the list with the highest sum.
2. **Lists with Negative Numbers**: The function will also work with lists containing negative numbers, as the `sum()` function will still provide the correct total.
3. **Lists with a Mix of Positive and Negative Numbers**: The function will correctly identify the list with the highest sum even if the lists contain a mix of positive and negative numbers.
4. **Empty Lists**: If an empty list is included among the lists, its sum will be 0, and it will not affect the identification of the list with the highest sum unless all lists are empty, in which case it will still return one of the empty lists (since `max()` can handle empty sequences by returning the first element it encounters, but in the context of `key=sum`, it's more about picking one of the empty lists as they all have the same sum).
5. **Lists with Duplicate Maximum Sums**: If there are multiple lists with the same maximum sum, the `max()` function will return the first one it encounters, which aligns with a valid interpretation of the problem description that does not specify what to do in the case of a tie.

The correction from a potential oversight regarding handling of empty lists or lists with non-numeric elements leads to the conclusion that the program as given is correct within the constraints of the problem description provided. The program does not include error handling for cases where the input lists might contain non-numeric values or where the input might not be a list of lists, but based strictly on the problem description given, the program performs as intended.
