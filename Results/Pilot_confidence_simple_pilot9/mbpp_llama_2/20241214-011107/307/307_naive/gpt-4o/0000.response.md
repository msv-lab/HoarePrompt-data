Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1(n)`, is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function works by continuously generating triangular numbers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` and checking if the length of the generated triangular number (when converted to a string) matches the input `n`. If it does, the function returns `k`, which represents the index of this smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

Here's why the code is correct for every potential case:
1. **Initialization**: The function starts with `k = 1`, which is the first possible index for a triangular number (since the first triangular number is 1, which is generated by `k = 1`).
2. **Infinite Loop**: The function uses a `while True:` loop, ensuring that it will continue to generate triangular numbers until it finds one with `n` digits. This is appropriate because there are infinitely many triangular numbers, and for any given number of digits `n`, there will eventually be a triangular number with `n` digits.
3. **Triangular Number Generation**: The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` correctly generates the `k`-th triangular number. This formula is derived from the fact that the `k`-th triangular number is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, which can be expressed as `1 + 2 +... + k = k * (k + 1) / 2`.
4. **Digit Length Check**: By converting the triangular number to a string and checking its length (`len(str(triangular_number)) == n`), the function accurately determines if the generated triangular number has `n` digits.
5. **Return Condition**: Once a triangular number with `n` digits is found, the function returns `k`, which is the index of this smallest triangular number with `n` digits, fulfilling the function's purpose.

Given these points, the function is designed to correctly find the index of the smallest triangular number with a specified number of digits for any positive integer input `n`. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further support the correctness of the function by verifying its output for specific inputs.
