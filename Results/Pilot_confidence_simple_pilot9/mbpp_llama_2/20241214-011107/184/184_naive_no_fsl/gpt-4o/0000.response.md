Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. The function uses a list comprehension with a conditional statement `num % 2!= 0` to filter out the even numbers.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears to correctly implement the problem description for all potential cases. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs.

Here are some reasons why the program is correct:

1. **Correct filtering logic**: The function uses the correct modulo operator (`%`) to determine whether a number is odd or even. The condition `num % 2!= 0` correctly identifies odd numbers.
2. **Handling of edge cases**: The function handles edge cases such as empty lists, lists with only even numbers, and lists with only odd numbers correctly.
3. **Input validation**: Although not explicitly implemented, the function assumes that the input is a list of integers. If the input is not a list or contains non-integer values, the function may raise an error or produce incorrect results. However, based on the problem description, it is reasonable to assume that the input will always be a list of integers.
4. **Unit tests**: The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs, including lists with a mix of odd and even numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description, and no potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
