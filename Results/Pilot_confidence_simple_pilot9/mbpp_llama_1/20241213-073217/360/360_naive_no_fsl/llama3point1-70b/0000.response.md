Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the list with the highest sum of elements. The `max` function with the `key=sum` argument is used to achieve this. This approach is correct because it iterates over all sublists, calculates their sums, and returns the sublist with the maximum sum.

Here are a few examples to demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- An empty list of lists: `func_1([])` will raise a `ValueError` exception, which might be considered as the expected behavior in this edge case, although it could be argued that returning `None` or an empty list might be more user-friendly.
- A list of lists with one sublist: `func_1([[1, 2, 3]])` will correctly return `[1, 2, 3]`.
- A list of lists with multiple sublists: `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])` will correctly return `[6, 7, 8, 9]` because the sum of its elements is the highest.
- A list of lists with duplicate maximum sum sublists: `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])` will return one of the sublists with the maximum sum; the specific sublist returned may depend on the implementation of `max` in the Python version being used.

In all these cases, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. The program is concise, readable, and correctly implements the required functionality without any visible edge cases that it does not handle as described.
