Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(numbers)` takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer using the `round()` function, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then returns this sum multiplied by the length of the input list. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The function correctly rounds each number in the input list. The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` iterates over each number in the input list and applies the `round()` function to it.

2. **Calculating Sum**: It then calculates the sum of these rounded numbers using the built-in `sum()` function.

3. **Multiplication by Length**: Finally, it multiplies this sum by the length of the input list, which is obtained using `len(numbers)`.

The code handles all potential cases as specified by the problem description without any edge cases that would cause it to fail. For example:

- **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, `len(numbers)` will be 0, and any number multiplied by 0 is 0, which is the expected result since the sum of an empty list is considered 0.

- **List with Single Element**: For a list with a single element, the function will round that element and then multiply the sum (which is just the rounded element) by 1 (the length of the list), resulting in the rounded element itself, which is correct.

- **Lists with Multiple Elements**: For lists with multiple elements, the function correctly rounds each element, sums them, and then multiplies this sum by the number of elements in the list.

Given that the code handles all these cases correctly and follows the problem description, it is considered correct.
