Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly implements the described functionality. It rounds every number in the given list, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input, uses a list comprehension to round each number in the list, sums these rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the original list length.

Here is a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The program correctly rounds each number in the list using the `round()` function.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It accurately calculates the sum of the rounded numbers using the built-in `sum()` function.
3. **Multiplication**: The sum of the rounded numbers is then correctly multiplied by the length of the original list, obtained using `len()`.
4. **Return Value**: The result of this multiplication is returned by the function.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, further supporting the correctness of the program. Without being able to identify a case where the program does not work as described, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
