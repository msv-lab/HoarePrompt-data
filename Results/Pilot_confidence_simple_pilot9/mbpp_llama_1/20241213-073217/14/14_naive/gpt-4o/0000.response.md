Correctness: **True**.

The given function, `func_1`, is designed to determine whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. It uses a set, `seen`, to keep track of the numbers it has encountered so far.

Here's how it works:

1. It initializes an empty set, `seen`.
2. It then iterates over each number in the input array.
3. For each number, it checks if the number is already in the `seen` set. If it is, that means the number has been encountered before, and therefore, it's a duplicate. The function immediately returns `True` in this case.
4. If the number is not in the `seen` set, it is added to the set.
5. If the function iterates through the entire array without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`, indicating that there are no duplicate elements.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies arrays with duplicate elements and those without.

The provided unit tests also support this conclusion:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False` because there are no duplicates in the array.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]) == True` because the number 4 is duplicated.
- `func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == True` because there are multiple duplicates in the array.

The function's logic and the unit tests demonstrate that it correctly handles arrays with and without duplicate elements, making it correct according to the problem description.
