Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` checks if a list contains duplicate elements by comparing the length of the original list to the length of a set created from the list. In Python, sets are unordered collections of unique elements, meaning that any duplicate elements are automatically removed when the set is created. Therefore, if the lengths of the list and the set are not equal, it means that there were duplicate elements in the list.

This approach is correct because it handles all possible cases:

- If the list contains duplicate elements, the set will be smaller, and the function will return `True`.
- If the list does not contain duplicate elements, the set will be the same size as the list, and the function will return `False`.
- It also correctly handles edge cases such as an empty list (which does not contain duplicates) and a list with a single element (which also does not contain duplicates).
- Additionally, it is independent of the type of integers (positive, negative, zero) and their order in the array.

Since we cannot find any potential case where this function does not behave as expected according to the problem description, we conclude that the function is correct.
