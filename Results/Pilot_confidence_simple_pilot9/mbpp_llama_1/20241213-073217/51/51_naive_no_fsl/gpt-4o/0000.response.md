Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers, multiplies all the numbers together, and then divides the product by the length of the list. 

The function iterates over each number in the input list, multiplying the current product by the number. After all numbers have been processed, it calculates the result by dividing the product by the length of the list.

All the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) pass, which suggests that the function works correctly for various inputs, including positive and negative numbers.

Additionally, the function handles the case where the input list contains a mix of positive and negative numbers correctly, as the product of an even number of negative numbers is positive, and the product of an odd number of negative numbers is negative.

The use of `math.isclose` in the unit tests ensures that the function's result is compared to the expected result with a tolerance, which is important when dealing with floating-point numbers.

One potential edge case to consider is when the input list is empty. In this case, the function would raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to divide by the length of the list. However, the problem description does not specify what to do in this case, so it's unclear whether this should be considered an incorrect behavior. If we assume that the input list will never be empty, then the function is correct. 

It's worth noting that this function could be simplified using the `math.prod` function (available in Python 3.8 and later) to calculate the product of the numbers, like this:

```python
import math

def func_1(numbers):
    return math.prod(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

This version of the function is more concise and arguably more readable, but it has the same correctness properties as the original version. 

Since we cannot think of any case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description, the program is considered correct.
