Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which is specifically designed for finding the insertion point for a specified value in sorted order to maintain sorted order. 

- The function `bisect.bisect_right` returns an insertion point which comes after (to the right of) any existing entries of the same value in the sorted list. This aligns perfectly with the problem description of locating the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.

- All assertions provided with the code example indicate that the function behaves as expected:
  - When the value is greater than any in the list, it returns the length of the list (`func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4`).
  - When the value fits within the sorted list, it returns the correct index to maintain sorted order (`func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2`).
  - When the value is even greater than the largest in the list, it still correctly returns the length of the list (`func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4`).

Considering the `bisect.bisect_right` function's purpose and the assertions validating the code's behavior for different scenarios, the program seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement for all potential cases.
