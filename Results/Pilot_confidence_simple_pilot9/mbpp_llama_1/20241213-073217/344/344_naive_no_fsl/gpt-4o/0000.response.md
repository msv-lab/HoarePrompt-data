Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses the `bisect` module to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the index where the specified value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

The program works correctly for the provided test cases:

- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is the correct insertion point for the value `6` to maintain the sorted order.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is the correct insertion point for the value `3` to maintain the sorted order.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` returns `4`, which is the correct insertion point for the value `7` to maintain the sorted order.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work as expected. The `bisect.bisect_right` function is a standard library function that is designed to handle various edge cases, including:

- Duplicate values in the sorted list
- Values that are already present in the sorted list
- Values that are less than the smallest or greater than the largest value in the sorted list

Since the program uses a standard library function that is well-tested and handles various edge cases, and the provided test cases demonstrate its correctness, I conclude that the program is correct.
