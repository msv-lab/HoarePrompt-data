Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program is intended to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` and `target`. The `target` parameter is not used within the function, which suggests a potential discrepancy between the function's implementation and its intended purpose as described in the problem statement.

A case where the program does not work as expected is when the input array is empty. In such a scenario, the function will throw an error because it attempts to access elements of the array without checking if the array is empty. 

Furthermore, the presence of the unused `target` parameter in the function definition indicates that the function might have been intended for a different purpose or problem, where the target played a role, but it does not match the problem description provided. The function should be designed to only take the array as input if the goal is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

To fix this and make the function correct according to the problem description, it should be modified to handle the edge case of an empty array and to ignore or remove the `target` parameter, as it's not required for calculating the minimum difference between any two elements in an array. 

Here's an example of how the corrected function could look:

```python
def find_min_diff(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return None  # or any other appropriate value to indicate an error
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```
