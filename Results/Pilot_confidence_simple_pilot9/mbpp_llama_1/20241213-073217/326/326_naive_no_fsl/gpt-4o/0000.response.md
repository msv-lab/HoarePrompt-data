Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It takes an array `arr` and its size `n` as input, sorts the array, and then iterates over it to find the minimum difference between any two elements. 

Here's why the code is correct:
1. **Sorting the array**: The code first checks if the size of the array is less than 2. If so, it returns 0 because there are not enough elements to calculate the difference. Then, it sorts the array in ascending order, which is a crucial step to ensure that the differences calculated are indeed between adjacent elements.
2. **Initializing the minimum difference**: It initializes `min_diff` with positive infinity, ensuring that any difference found in the array will be smaller.
3. **Calculating the differences**: The code then iterates over the sorted array, calculating the differences between each pair of adjacent elements. If a difference is found to be smaller than the current `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff`.
4. **Returning the minimum difference**: Finally, it returns `min_diff`, which is the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

All the test cases provided in the problem description are correctly handled by this function. The function's logic is sound, and it correctly handles edge cases, such as when the array size is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. 

Without being able to find a case where the program does not work as expected according to the description, we conclude that the code is correct.
