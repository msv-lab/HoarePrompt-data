Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the parity of a given number `n` is odd and `False` otherwise. The function uses the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2, and checks if the result is not equal to 0. This is a correct implementation of the problem description.

Here's why the code works correctly in every case:

- If `n` is an odd integer, `n % 2` will result in 1, and `n % 2!= 0` will evaluate to `True`.
- If `n` is an even integer, `n % 2` will result in 0, and `n % 2!= 0` will evaluate to `False`.
- The function handles both positive and negative integers correctly, as the modulus operator in Python returns the remainder with the same sign as the divisor (2 in this case).
- The function also handles zero correctly, returning `False` as expected.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
