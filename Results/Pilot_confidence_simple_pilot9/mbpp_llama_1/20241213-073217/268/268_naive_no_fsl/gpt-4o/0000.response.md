Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a matrix (represented as a list of lists) and an integer `n` as input, and returns the maximum value in the `n`-th column of the matrix. The function uses a list comprehension to extract the `n`-th column from the matrix, and then returns the maximum value in this column using the built-in `max` function.

The program is correct because it handles all possible cases:

1.  **Valid input**: The function works correctly when given a valid matrix and a valid column index `n`. For example, `func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2)` correctly returns `19`, which is the maximum value in the 3rd column (remember that column indices start at 0).

2.  **Empty matrix**: Although not explicitly tested, the function will raise an exception if given an empty matrix, because it attempts to access elements in the matrix without checking if the matrix is empty. However, this behavior can be considered correct if the problem description explicitly states that the input matrix will never be empty.

3.  **Column index out of range**: The function will also raise an exception if `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix. Again, this behavior can be considered correct if the problem description explicitly states that `n` will always be a valid column index.

To make the function more robust, you could add error checking code to handle these edge cases explicitly. However, based on the provided problem description and the given unit tests, the function appears to be correct.
