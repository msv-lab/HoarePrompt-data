Correctness: **True**.

The given function, `func_1(matrix, n)`, appears to correctly find the maximum value in the n-th column of a given matrix. The code uses a generator expression to select the n-th element from each row and then applies the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value.

Here's a breakdown of why this code works:

1. The function iterates over each row in the matrix.
2. For each row, it selects the n-th element (since Python uses zero-based indexing, `n - 1` is used).
3. The `max` function then compares these elements to find the maximum value.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Matrices with varying numbers of rows and columns.
- Columns containing different data types (as long as they can be compared, e.g., integers, floats).
- Matrices with duplicate maximum values in a column.

One potential edge case to consider is if the matrix is empty or if the column index `n` is out of range. In such cases, the function might throw an exception. For instance, if the matrix is empty, the generator expression will be empty, and `max` will throw a `ValueError`. If `n` is larger than the number of columns, an `IndexError` will be thrown.

However, these edge cases do not necessarily indicate a flaw in the function's logic for finding the maximum value in a specified column when the input is valid. They could be considered as issues with input validation rather than the function's correctness in performing its intended task.

To make the function more robust, you might want to add input validation to handle these edge cases, but as far as the problem description is concerned, the function as presented does what it's supposed to do for valid inputs.
