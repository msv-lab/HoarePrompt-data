Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of finding the maximum value in the nth column of a given matrix. 

Here's why I believe the code is correct for all potential cases:

1. The function uses list comprehension to extract the nth column from the matrix, which is a straightforward and efficient approach.

2. It then uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in the extracted column, which correctly handles the requirement.

3. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) cover different scenarios, including matrices with varying sizes and values, and the function passes these tests.

4. I could not find any potential case where the function would not work as expected. For example, it correctly handles:
   - Matrices with multiple rows and columns.
   - Matrices with negative numbers or zeros.
   - Matrices with duplicate values in the nth column.
   - Matrices where the nth column has only one element (in which case the function would still return that single element as the maximum).

Overall, based on the provided code and the problem description, I believe the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
