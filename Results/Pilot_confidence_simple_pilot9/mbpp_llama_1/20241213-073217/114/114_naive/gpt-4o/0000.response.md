Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, takes in a tuple `tup` and an `element` as input and returns the count of occurrences of the `element` in the `tuple`. The function uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which counts the number of occurrences of the specified element.

This function will work correctly for all possible inputs because it does not have any explicit or implicit assumptions about the input values. It can handle tuples with any number of elements and any type of elements (not just integers). It can also handle cases where the element is not found in the tuple, in which case it will correctly return 0.

For example, the provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for different cases. It correctly counts the occurrences of different elements in the tuple, including elements that are present multiple times, elements that are present only once, and elements that are not present at all.

The function is simple, readable, and maintainable, and it does not have any potential edge cases that are not handled correctly. Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided unit tests, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
