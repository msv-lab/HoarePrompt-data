Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. This function takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the count of `elem` in `tup`. The function works as expected for all possible inputs, including if the element is not found in the tuple (in which case it returns 0) or if the tuple is empty. 

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), 2)`, it will correctly return `2`. If we call `func_1((1, 2, 3), 4)`, it will correctly return `0`. 

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
