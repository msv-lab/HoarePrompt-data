Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the described functionality. The `zip` function is used to pair corresponding elements from the two input tuples, and a generator expression is used to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the elements of the first tuple. The result is then returned as a tuple.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The `zip` function ensures that the elements at the same index are paired together from both tuples.
2. The generator expression `(a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2))` correctly subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the elements of the first tuple.
3. The `tuple` function is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple, which is the expected output format.

The program handles cases where the input tuples have the same length, as it uses the `zip` function, which stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted. If the tuples have different lengths, the program will still work correctly, but the extra elements from the longer tuple will be ignored.

For example:

* `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))` returns `(-3, -3, -3)`, which is the expected result.
* `func_1((1, 2), (4, 5, 6))` returns `(-3, -3)`, which is the expected result because the extra element `6` from the second tuple is ignored.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
