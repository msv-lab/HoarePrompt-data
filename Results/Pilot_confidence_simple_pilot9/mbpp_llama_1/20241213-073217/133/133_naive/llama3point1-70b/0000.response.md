Correctness: **True**

The provided function, `func_1(tup1, tup2)`, successfully takes two tuples as input and subtracts corresponding elements. This is achieved by using the `zip` function, which pairs elements from both tuples based on their index, and a generator expression that performs the subtraction.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why this function works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Handling Tuples of Equal Length**: When `tup1` and `tup2` have the same length, `zip(tup1, tup2)` pairs each element from `tup1` with the corresponding element from `tup2`. The generator expression `(a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2))` then subtracts each pair of elements, and the `tuple(...)` function converts the resulting generator into a tuple, which is the desired output.

2. **Handling Tuples of Different Lengths**: If `tup1` and `tup2` are of different lengths, `zip(tup1, tup2)` will stop once the shorter tuple is exhausted. This means any additional elements in the longer tuple are ignored, which aligns with the typical behavior expected in such operations.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as empty tuples correctly. When either `tup1` or `tup2` (or both) are empty, `zip(tup1, tup2)` will also be empty, resulting in an empty tuple returned by the function, which is the expected result.

Since this function behaves as expected for all potential cases, including different lengths and edge cases like empty tuples, it is considered correct.
