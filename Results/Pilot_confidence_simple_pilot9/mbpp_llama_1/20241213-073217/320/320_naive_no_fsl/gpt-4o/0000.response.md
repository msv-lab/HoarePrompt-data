Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct because it correctly implements the function to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` starts by removing duplicates from the input list `nums` by converting it to a set and then sorts the unique numbers in ascending order.

2. It then checks if the length of the unique numbers list is greater than 1. If it is, the function returns the second smallest number, which is the number at index 1 in the sorted list.

3. If the length of the unique numbers list is not greater than 1, the function returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest number.

This approach handles all potential cases, including:

- Lists with multiple unique elements
- Lists with duplicate elements
- Lists with less than two unique elements (in which case it correctly returns `None`)

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness in various scenarios, and there are no obvious edge cases that the function does not handle. Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the program is correct.
