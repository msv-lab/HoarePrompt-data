Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to filter odd numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums`. It checks if a number is odd by using the condition `num % 2!= 0`, which is a standard method for identifying odd numbers (since even numbers would result in a remainder of 0 when divided by 2).

The function correctly returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios, including lists with both odd and even numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers (in which case an empty list or a list with odd numbers should be returned, accordingly).

Upon examining the code, there are no apparent edge cases or inputs for which the function would not work as expected. The function will work correctly for:

- Empty lists: It will return an empty list, which is the correct behavior for filtering odd numbers from an empty list.
- Lists with negative numbers: The modulo operation (`%`) in Python works correctly with negative numbers, so it will correctly identify odd negative numbers.
- Lists with non-integer numbers: However, the function will work as expected for non-integer inputs as well because the modulo operation will still yield a result that can be compared to 0. For floating-point numbers, the function might not behave as expected if the task implicitly assumes integers, but based on the provided problem description and the code, it seems to be designed to work with integers.

Given that the function is straightforward, uses a standard and reliable method for checking if a number is odd, and the provided unit tests cover various scenarios, there is no apparent reason to believe the function is incorrect for the described task.
