Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it uses a list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from the input list `nums`. The condition `num % 2!= 0` checks if a number is odd (i.e., if the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is not 0), and if it is, the number is included in the output list. This logic correctly filters out the even numbers and returns a list of only the odd numbers.

To test the correctness of the program, consider the following cases:

* Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Expected output: `[1, 3, 5]`. The program correctly returns this output.
* Input: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. Expected output: `[]`. The program correctly returns this output.
* Input: `[1, 3, 5, 7]`. Expected output: `[1, 3, 5, 7]`. The program correctly returns this output.
* Input: `[]`. Expected output: `[]`. The program correctly returns this output.

In all these cases, the program works as expected, filtering out the even numbers and returning a list of only the odd numbers. Since we cannot find any case where the program does not work correctly, we can conclude that the program is correct.
