Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number `b` followed by the first number `a`. The code is straightforward and does not contain any logical errors or edge cases that could cause it to fail.

Here are a few examples that demonstrate the correctness of the function:

* `func_1(1, 2)` returns `(2, 1)`
* `func_1(3, 4)` returns `(4, 3)`
* `func_1(-1, 0)` returns `(0, -1)`

In each of these cases, the function behaves as expected, returning a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. Since the function does not contain any conditional statements or loops, it is unlikely to fail for any particular input. Therefore, based on the provided code, it appears to be correct for all potential cases.
