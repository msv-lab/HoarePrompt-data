Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly convert a snake case string to camel case. The problem with the program is that it capitalizes the first letter of every component of the snake case string, but it does not remove the underscores or change the case of the first component as required for camel case. 

For example, if we call `func_1('hello_world')`, the function will return 'HelloWorld' which is correct, but if we call `func_1('snake_case_string')`, the function will return 'SnakeCaseString' which is correct, but it will not work as expected when the input is a single word like 'hello'. 

However, the main issue arises when the snake_case string starts with an underscore, the function will incorrectly capitalize the first letter of the second component. A correct implementation should handle the first component differently, it should not capitalize the first letter of the first component unless the entire string is a single word. 

To correctly convert a snake case string to camel case, we should not capitalize the first component unless it is the only component. 

Here's an example where the function does not work as expected: 

```python
print(func_1('_hello_world'))  # Should return 'helloWorld' but returns 'HelloWorld'
```
