Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly convert a snake case string to a camel case string. In a camel case string, the first word should be in lowercase and the subsequent words should be in title case. The given program capitalizes all the words, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input is "hello_world", the correct camel case conversion should be "helloWorld", but the given program will return "HelloWorld". 

Here is the correct code:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
This corrected code will ensure that the first word is in lowercase and the subsequent words are in title case, which is the correct camel case conversion.
