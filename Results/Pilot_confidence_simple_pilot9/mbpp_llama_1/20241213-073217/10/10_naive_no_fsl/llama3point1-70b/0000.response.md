Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `V = (1/2) * b * h * l`, where `b` is the base length, `h` is the height of the triangle, and `l` is the length of the prism.

The function `func_1(b, h, l)` correctly implements this formula by returning `b * h / 2 * l`. The order of operations in Python ensures that the division by 2 is performed before the multiplication by `l`, which is consistent with the formula.

I could not find any case where the program does not work correctly. The function correctly handles positive inputs for `b`, `h`, and `l`, and it also correctly handles cases where these inputs are zero or negative (although the result may not be physically meaningful in such cases).

For example, if we call `func_1(2, 3, 4)`, the function correctly returns `(2 * 3 / 2) * 4 = 12`, which is the volume of a triangular prism with a base length of 2, a height of 3, and a length of 4.

Overall, the provided Python function correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism and works as expected for all potential cases.
