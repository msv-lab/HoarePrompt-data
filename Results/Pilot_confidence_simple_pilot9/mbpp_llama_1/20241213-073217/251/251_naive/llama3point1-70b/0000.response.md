Correctness: **True**.

The provided code accurately converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. 

Here's why the code works correctly:

1. It calculates the radial distance `r` using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which is the correct formula to calculate the distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`.

2. It calculates the angle `phi` using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which is the correct function to calculate the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`. The `atan2` function is used instead of `atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero and to get the correct quadrant for the angle.

The code handles all potential cases correctly:

- It handles the case where `x` and `y` are both zero, returning `r = 0` and `phi = 0`.
- It handles the case where `x` is zero and `y` is non-zero, returning the correct angle `phi` based on the sign of `y`.
- It handles the case where `y` is zero and `x` is non-zero, returning the correct angle `phi` based on the sign of `x`.
- It handles the case where `x` and `y` are both non-zero, returning the correct radial distance `r` and angle `phi`.

Therefore, the program is correct.
