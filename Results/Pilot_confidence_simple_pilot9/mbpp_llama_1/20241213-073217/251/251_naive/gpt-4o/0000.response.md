Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correctly implemented to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function calculates the radius `r` using the Pythagorean theorem and the angle `theta` using the `atan2` function, which is the correct method for converting between rectangular and polar coordinates.

The use of `math.atan2(y, x)` instead of `math.atan(y/x)` is particularly important, as it correctly handles the case where `x` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error with the latter method. Additionally, `atan2` takes into account the quadrant of the point, ensuring that the angle is calculated correctly.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various input values. Without being able to find a counterexample or edge case where the function fails to produce the correct polar coordinates, it can be concluded that the function is correct.

It's worth noting that the function does not handle complex or non-numeric inputs, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. If the problem description required such handling, the function would be incorrect. However, based on the provided information, the function appears to be correct for all real-valued inputs.
