Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the `math.sqrt` and `math.atan2` functions.

The program calculates the radial distance `r` using the formula `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, which is a standard method for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It then calculates the angle `theta` using the `math.atan2` function, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y).

The use of `math.atan2` instead of `math.atan` is important because it handles the case where `x` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error with `math.atan`. `math.atan2` also returns the correct angle for negative values of `x` and `y`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the program works correctly for various inputs. Since the program uses standard mathematical formulas and handles edge cases correctly, it is reasonable to conclude that it will work correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
