Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function appears to correctly calculate the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. 

The function `func_1(n)` generates a list of the first n even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. Then, it calculates the sum of the cubes of these numbers using a generator expression: `sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`.

This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all positive integers n. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, and `assert func_1(4) == 800`, demonstrate the function's correctness for specific cases.

To further verify the correctness, let's consider a few more test cases:

* `func_1(1)` should return 8 (2^3), which it does.
* `func_1(5)` should return 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 + 10^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 + 1000 = 1800, which it does.

After examining the code and considering various test cases, it appears that the function correctly calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers for all positive integers n.
