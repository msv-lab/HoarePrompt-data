Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
2. It calculates the sum of the cubes of these numbers using a generator expression: `sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`.
3. It returns this sum.

The unit tests provided (`assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, and `assert func_1(4) == 800`) all pass, suggesting that the function works correctly for these cases.

In general, the function should work correctly for any positive integer `n`, since it correctly generates the list of even numbers and calculates their sum of cubes.

To verify this, we can also manually calculate the results for a few small values of `n`:

* `n = 1`: The first even natural number is 2, and its cube is 8. The function correctly returns 8.
* `n = 2`: The first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4, and their cubes are 8 and 64, respectively. The sum of these cubes is 72, which is what the function returns.
* `n = 3`: The first three even natural numbers are 2, 4, and 6, and their cubes are 8, 64, and 216, respectively. The sum of these cubes is 288, which is what the function returns.

Since the function passes all the provided unit tests and appears to work correctly for all positive integers `n`, we can conclude that it is correct.
