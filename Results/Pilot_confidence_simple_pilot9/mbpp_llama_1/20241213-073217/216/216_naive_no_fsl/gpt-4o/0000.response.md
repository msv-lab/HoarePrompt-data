Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The code first checks if the input list is empty and returns False if it is. Then, it sorts the list in ascending order. After sorting, it iterates through the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair where the difference is not 1, it immediately returns False. If it finishes checking all pairs without finding any non-consecutive numbers, it returns True.

This program works correctly for every potential case, including:

- Empty lists: The function correctly returns False for empty lists.
- Lists with consecutive numbers: The function correctly returns True for lists with consecutive numbers, such as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
- Lists without consecutive numbers: The function correctly returns False for lists without consecutive numbers, such as [1, 2, 3, 5, 6].
- Lists with duplicate numbers: The function correctly returns False for lists with duplicate numbers, such as [1, 2, 1], because the presence of duplicates means the numbers are not consecutive.

Overall, the program correctly checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers or not, handling all potential edge cases.
