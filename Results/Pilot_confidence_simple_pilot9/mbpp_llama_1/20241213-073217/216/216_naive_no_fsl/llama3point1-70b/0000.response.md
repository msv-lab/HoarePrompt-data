Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers. Here's why it is correct:

1. The function first sorts the input list `lst` in ascending order. This is necessary because the problem statement does not assume the input list is already sorted.

2. The function then checks if all differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list are equal to 1 using the `all` function with a generator expression. This ensures that the numbers in the list are consecutive.

3. The function also checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of a set created from the list. This ensures that there are no duplicate numbers in the list, which is a requirement for the numbers to be consecutive.

The combination of these two checks ensures that the function will correctly identify lists that contain consecutive numbers and reject lists that do not.

For example, the function will return `True` for the lists `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` (after sorting), and `False` for the lists `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, and `[1, 3, 4, 5]`.

Since the function handles all possible cases correctly, its correctness is **True**.
