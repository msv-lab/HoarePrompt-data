Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1`, takes a list and an integer `n` as input, and it splits the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. The function uses the modulo operator (`i % n`) to distribute the elements of the input list into separate sublists.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. The function initializes an empty list (`result`) with `n` sublists.
2. It iterates over the input list using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `element` of each item in the list.
3. For each element, it uses the modulo operator (`i % n`) to determine which sublist (`result[i % n]`) the element should be appended to.
4. Finally, it returns the `result` list containing the `n` sublists.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for different input lists and values of `n`. Additionally, the function's logic is sound and should handle any valid input.

For example, if we pass the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2` to the function, it will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which is the expected result. Similarly, if we pass the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `n = 3`, it will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5], [3, 6]]`, which is also correct.

Overall, the function is well-structured, and its logic is easy to understand. After analyzing the function and considering various input scenarios, it appears that the function is correct and should handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
