Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(month)` checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. It correctly identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) and returns `True` if the month number is in the list of these months, and `False` otherwise.

This function works as expected for all possible inputs from 1 to 12. For example, `func_1(4)` returns `True` because April has 30 days, and `func_1(1)` returns `False` because January has 31 days. 

The function handles all edge cases correctly, including the months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11) and the months with 31 or fewer days (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12). 

Since the function behaves as described for all possible inputs, it is considered correct.
