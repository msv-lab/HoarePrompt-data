Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of tuples as input and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. This is achieved using the `zip(*tuples)` expression, which transposes the tuples, and a list comprehension that calculates the average of each set of values.

The code works as follows:

- `zip(*tuples)` unpacks the tuples and transposes them, so that the first elements of each tuple are together, the second elements are together, and so on.
- `sum(val)` calculates the sum of the values at each position across all tuples.
- `len(tuples)` gives the total number of tuples, which is used to calculate the average.

For example, given the input `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, `zip(*tuples)` would result in `((1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9))`. Then, the list comprehension would calculate the averages as `[sum(1, 4, 7) / 3, sum(2, 5, 8) / 3, sum(3, 6, 9) / 3]`, resulting in `[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]`.

This function handles tuples of any length and any number of tuples, as long as all tuples have the same length. If tuples of different lengths are provided, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shortest tuple, potentially leading to incorrect averages if the remaining tuples have more elements. However, based on the problem description, it is assumed that all tuples have the same length. 

In summary, the function is correct because it accurately calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input, given that all tuples are of the same length.
