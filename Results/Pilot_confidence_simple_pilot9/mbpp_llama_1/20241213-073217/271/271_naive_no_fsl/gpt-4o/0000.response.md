Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and it meets the requirements in the problem description. It calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. 

The function `func_1` works as follows:

- It first determines the number of elements in each tuple by checking the length of the first tuple (`num_elements = len(tuples[0])`).
- Then it iterates over each position `i` in the tuples.
- For each position, it extracts the elements at that position from all tuples using a list comprehension (`elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`).
- It calculates the average of these elements by summing them up and dividing by the total number of tuples (`avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`).
- The calculated average is then appended to the `averages` list.
- Finally, the function returns the `averages` list.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases with different numbers of tuples and different numbers of elements in each tuple. It also correctly handles cases where the input tuples contain negative numbers or zeros.

I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
