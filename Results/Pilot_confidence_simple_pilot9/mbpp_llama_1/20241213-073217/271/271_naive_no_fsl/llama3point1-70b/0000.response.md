Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a function named `func_1` that takes a tuple of tuples as input and returns a list of averages for corresponding elements across all tuples. The function utilizes list comprehension and the built-in `zip` and `sum` functions along with `len` to calculate these averages.

Here's a break down of why the program works as expected:

1. **Handling of Input**: The function accepts a tuple of tuples (`tuples`), which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Use of `zip(*tuples)`**: The `zip(*tuples)` expression unpacks the input tuple of tuples and applies `zip` to these unpacked tuples. `zip` combines the i-th elements of each of the argument sequences or iterables into tuples, effectively grouping elements by their position.

3. **Calculation of Average**: For each group of elements at the same position (achieved through `zip`), the function calculates the sum of these elements using `sum(val)` and then divides by the total number of tuples (`len(tuples)`) to find the average.

4. **Handling of Positions with Different Lengths**: If the input tuples have different lengths, `zip` will stop once the shortest input iterable is exhausted. This is consistent with the problem's implicit requirement that all tuples must be of the same length for the average calculation to make sense at every position.

Given the logic and functionality implemented, the program correctly computes the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. It correctly handles the requirement for each position, computes the average of values from all tuples at that position, and does so for every potential case where the input is a tuple of tuples.

The function is concise and effectively utilizes Python's built-in functions to achieve the desired outcome without any apparent edge cases that it does not handle correctly, assuming the input tuples are of equal length as implicitly required by the problem's nature.
