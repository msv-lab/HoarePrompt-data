Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` checks whether two numbers `a` and `b` differ at one bit position only or not. The function uses bitwise operations to achieve this.

Here's how it works:

1. `a ^ b` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `b`, which sets a bit to 1 if the corresponding bits in `a` and `b` are different. The result is stored in `xor_result`.
2. `xor_result!= 0` checks if `xor_result` is not zero, which means there is at least one bit difference between `a` and `b`.
3. `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` checks if `xor_result` has only one bit set to 1. This is done by subtracting 1 from `xor_result`, which sets all bits to the right of the rightmost 1 bit to 1 and the rightmost 1 bit to 0. If the result of the bitwise AND operation between `xor_result` and `xor_result - 1` is 0, it means there is only one bit set to 1 in `xor_result`.

The function returns `True` if both conditions are met, indicating that `a` and `b` differ at one bit position only.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
