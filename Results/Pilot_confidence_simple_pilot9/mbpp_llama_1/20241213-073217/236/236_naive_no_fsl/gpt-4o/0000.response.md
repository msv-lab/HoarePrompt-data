Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It does this by iterating over each element in the list and comparing it with the next element. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates over the entire list without finding any such pair, it returns `True`.

This function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- An empty list or a list with a single element (which are considered sorted)
- A list in ascending order
- A list in descending order (which is not considered sorted)
- A list with duplicate elements

For example, the function will return `True` for the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `False` for the list `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, and `True` for the list `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

The function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, because it makes a single pass over the list. This makes it efficient for large lists.

Overall, the function is simple, efficient, and correct, and it handles all potential edge cases.
