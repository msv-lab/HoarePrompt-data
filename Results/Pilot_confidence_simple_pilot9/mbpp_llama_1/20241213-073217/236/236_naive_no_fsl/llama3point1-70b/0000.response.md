Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise.

The program works by comparing the input list `nums` with its sorted version using the built-in `sorted` function. If the two lists are equal, it means the original list is already sorted, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: The `sorted` function returns an empty list for empty input, so the comparison will be correct.
* Lists with a single element: A list with one element is always sorted, and the comparison will reflect this.
* Lists with multiple elements: The `sorted` function will rearrange the elements in ascending order, allowing the comparison to correctly identify sorted and unsorted lists.
* Lists with duplicate elements: The `sorted` function is stable, meaning it preserves the order of equal elements, so the comparison will correctly handle lists with duplicates.
* Lists with negative numbers and/or zero: The `sorted` function correctly handles negative numbers and zero, so the comparison will work as expected.

Since the program correctly handles all these cases and no other edge cases are apparent, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.
