Correctness: **True**

The given function, `func_1`, checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function works by first converting the number to a string to easily calculate the number of digits. It then calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits. Finally, it checks if this sum is equal to the original number.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(153) == True` and `assert func_1(259) == False`, demonstrate the function's correctness for several cases. The function also handles numbers of different lengths, as shown by `assert func_1(4458) == False`.

To verify the correctness of the function, I considered various potential cases:

- **Single-digit numbers**: All single-digit numbers are Armstrong numbers because any digit raised to the power of 1 is itself. The function correctly handles this case.
- **Multi-digit numbers**: The function correctly calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.
- **Edge cases**: The function should handle edge cases such as 0, negative numbers, and non-integer inputs. However, it's worth noting that the traditional definition of Armstrong numbers only applies to positive integers. The function does not explicitly handle non-integer or negative inputs, but based on the given problem description, it seems that these cases are not considered.

Since I couldn't find any potential case where the function does not work correctly according to the provided problem description, I conclude that the function is correct.
