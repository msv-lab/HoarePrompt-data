Correctness: **True**

The given Python program checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function `func_1` takes a month number as input and returns `True` if the month has 31 days, and `False` otherwise. 

The program uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. This set includes the months January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which are the months that have 31 days in the Gregorian calendar.

The function then checks if the input month is in this set, and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. This approach is correct because it covers all the months that have 31 days, and it correctly identifies the months that do not have 31 days.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. The function returns `True` for the months with 31 days and `False` for the months without 31 days. 

Therefore, based on the given problem description, the provided program is correct, and it handles all the potential cases as expected.
