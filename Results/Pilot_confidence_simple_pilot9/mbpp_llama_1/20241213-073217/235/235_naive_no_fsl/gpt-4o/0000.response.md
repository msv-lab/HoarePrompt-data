Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.

Here's why the code is correct:

* The function uses a while loop to iterate over each digit of the input number `n`.
* In each iteration, it calculates the last digit of `n` using `n % 10` and adds it to the running total `total`.
* Then, it removes the last digit from `n` by performing integer division `n //= 10`.
* This process continues until `n` becomes 0, at which point all digits have been processed and the sum of the digits is returned.
* The function handles non-negative integers of any size, as the while loop will terminate when `n` becomes 0.
* The function also handles single-digit numbers correctly, as the while loop will execute only once in such cases.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the code, as they cover different cases and the function passes all of them.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, no scenario was found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
