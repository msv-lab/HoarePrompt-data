Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1(n)`, correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It does this by first converting the integer into a string, allowing it to iterate over each digit, convert each digit back into an integer, and then sum all these digits together.

This approach works correctly for all non-negative integers because it handles every digit in the number, regardless of its position or the number's size. The use of a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function makes the code concise and efficient, as it avoids the need to create a temporary list of digits.

Since the function correctly handles any non-negative integer (including 0, single-digit numbers, and multi-digit numbers), I couldn't find a case where it does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
