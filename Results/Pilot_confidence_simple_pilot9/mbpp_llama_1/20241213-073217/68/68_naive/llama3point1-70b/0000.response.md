Correctness: **True**.

The provided program uses the `cmath.phase()` function, which calculates the phase (or angle) of a complex number in radians. This function takes into account all possible cases, including complex numbers with zero real part, zero imaginary part, and negative real or imaginary parts.

The program correctly constructs a complex number from the input real and imaginary parts and then uses the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate the angle of the complex number. The `cmath.phase()` function returns the counterclockwise angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number.

The program does not have any edge cases that it does not handle correctly. For example, it can handle complex numbers with zero magnitude (both real and imaginary parts are zero), in which case `cmath.phase()` returns zero.

Here are some examples of the program working correctly:
- `func_1(1, 1)` should return approximately `math.pi/4` (0.785398), which it does.
- `func_1(-1, 0)` should return `math.pi` (3.14159), which it does.
- `func_1(0, -1)` should return `-math.pi/2` (-1.5708), which it does.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the angle of a complex number in all cases.
