Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then uses the `complex` function to create a complex number from these parts and the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the angle of the complex number.

The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The `cmath.phase` function returns the counterclockwise angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the description. The function handles all types of complex numbers, including those with zero real or imaginary parts, and it calculates the angle in the correct range (-π to π).

For instance, if you call `func_1(3, 4)`, it correctly returns the angle of the complex number 3 + 4j, which is approximately 0.927 radians (or 53.13 degrees).

In conclusion, the program is correct, and it should work as expected for all valid inputs.
