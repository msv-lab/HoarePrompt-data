Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. This function takes a complex number as input and returns its phase (or angle) in radians. 

The program includes three unit tests using `assert` statements, which verify that the function behaves as expected for specific inputs. The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the results with the expected values, allowing for a small relative tolerance to account for floating-point precision issues.

After reviewing the code, it appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. The `cmath.phase` function is a standard and reliable way to calculate the phase of a complex number in Python.

The program handles various cases, including complex numbers with positive and negative real and imaginary parts, as well as cases where the real or imaginary part is zero. The `cmath.phase` function returns the correct result for these cases, which is verified by the provided unit tests.

Since no potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected, the program is considered correct. It implements the required functionality, handles various input cases, and includes unit tests to verify its correctness.
