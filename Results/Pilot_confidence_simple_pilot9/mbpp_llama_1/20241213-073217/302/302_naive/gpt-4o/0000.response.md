Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's why:

1. The function uses a modified binary search algorithm, which is suitable for finding the first occurrence of an element in a sorted array.
2. When the middle element matches the target, the function updates the result and continues searching in the left half of the array to find the first occurrence.
3. The function maintains the `result` variable to store the index of the first occurrence of the target element. This variable is updated only when a match is found, and it is initialized to -1 to handle the case where the target element is not found.
4. The function returns the `result` variable, which will be the index of the first occurrence of the target element if found, or -1 if not found.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input cases. Additionally, the function handles edge cases such as:

* The target element is not found in the array (returns -1).
* The target element is the first element in the array (returns 0).
* The target element is the last element in the array (returns the correct index).

Overall, the function appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
