Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it uses a modified binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The algorithm works as follows:

*   It starts by initializing two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the beginning and end of the array respectively.
*   It then enters a while loop, which continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
*   Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `mid` and checks if the element at `mid` is equal to the target.
*   If the element is equal to the target, it updates the `result` variable with the current `mid` index and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This is done to continue searching for the first occurrence of the target on the left side of `mid`.
*   If the element at `mid` is less than the target, it moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.
*   If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, it moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`.
*   Once the loop ends, it returns the `result` variable, which holds the index of the first occurrence of the target.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array, making it efficient for large inputs.

The provided unit tests also pass, which further confirms the correctness of the program. The program handles the cases where the target is present in the array, as well as the cases where it is not present. The program also correctly handles the case where the target is the first element in the array.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
