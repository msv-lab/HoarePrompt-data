Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to extract the rear index element of each string in a given tuple. The function uses list comprehension to achieve this. 

Here's a breakdown of why this function is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a tuple of strings as input, which is as per the problem description.
2. **Indexing**: Python uses zero-based indexing, and `s[-1]` is the standard way to access the last character of a string `s`. This aligns with the requirement to extract the rear index element.
3. **List Comprehension**: The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates over each string in the input tuple and extracts the last character, creating a new list with these characters. This is a concise and efficient way to achieve the desired result.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Strings**: If a string in the tuple is empty, `s[-1]` will raise an `IndexError` because there is no last character to access. However, this is a reasonable behavior given that the task doesn't specify how to handle empty strings, and it's a clear indication that an operation cannot be performed as intended.
   - **Single-Element Strings**: For strings with a single character, `s[-1]` will correctly return that character.
   - **Non-String Elements in Tuple**: The function does not include error checking to ensure all elements in the tuple are strings. If the tuple contains non-string elements, the function may fail or behave unexpectedly when trying to access the last character. This is a potential issue but considering the task focuses on strings, it's reasonable to assume the input will comply, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Given the problem description's focus and the assumption of compliant input (a tuple of strings), the function correctly implements the required behavior for extracting the rear index element of each string. It handles typical cases as expected and follows standard Python practices for string manipulation.
