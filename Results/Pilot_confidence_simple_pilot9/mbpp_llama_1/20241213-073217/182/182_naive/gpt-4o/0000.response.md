Correctness: **True**.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. The function uses a list comprehension to achieve this, which is a concise and efficient way to create a new list by iterating over an existing iterable (in this case, the tuple of strings).

The code works as expected for all the provided test cases, and upon reviewing the code, there are no apparent edge cases that would cause the function to fail. For example, if the input tuple is empty, the function will correctly return an empty list. If the input tuple contains strings of varying lengths, the function will still correctly extract the last character of each string.

The key line of code `[s[-1] for s in tup]` uses Python's slice notation to access the last character of each string. The `-1` index refers to the last element of the string, and the list comprehension iterates over each string in the tuple to create a new list containing these last characters.

Therefore, based on the provided code and test cases, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
