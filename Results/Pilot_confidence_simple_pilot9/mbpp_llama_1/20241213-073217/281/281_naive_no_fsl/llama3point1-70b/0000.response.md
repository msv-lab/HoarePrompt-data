Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly finds even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `numbers` and checks if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0 using the modulo operator `%`. If the condition `num % 2 == 0` is met, the number is included in the output list.

This function handles all potential cases correctly:

- It correctly identifies even numbers in the list.
- It ignores odd numbers and non-integer values (if present, though the problem description doesn't explicitly mention non-integer values).
- It works with empty lists, returning an empty list.
- It works with lists containing only integers.

For example, given the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the function would return `[2, 4, 6]`, which are the even numbers in the list.

Given that the function behaves as expected for all possible inputs and edge cases considered, it is deemed correct according to the provided problem description.
