Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly identifies and returns even numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses list comprehension to iterate through the input list `numbers` and checks each number `num` to see if it is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This condition is true for even numbers because they divide by 2 without leaving a remainder. 

The function works correctly for various inputs, including lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with all even numbers, and lists with all odd numbers (in which case it returns an empty list, which is the expected behavior for finding even numbers).

To confirm its correctness, let's consider edge cases:

1. **Empty list**: If the input is an empty list `[]`, the function should return an empty list `[]` because there are no even numbers to find. This works as expected.

2. **List with negative numbers**: The function should also correctly identify negative even numbers because the modulo operation in Python works with negative numbers, treating them as expected in mathematical terms. For example, `-4 % 2` equals `0`, so `-4` would be correctly identified as an even number.

3. **List with floating-point numbers**: While the problem description and the provided assertions only deal with integers, it's worth noting how the function would behave with floating-point numbers. The function would correctly identify even integers within a list of floats but would not consider any floating-point numbers as even because they would not satisfy `num % 2 == 0` due to their fractional parts. This aligns with the typical interpretation of "even" in the context of integers.

Given that the function behaves as expected across these scenarios and the provided assertions validate its correctness for specific cases, there are no apparent edge cases or inputs for which the function fails to meet the problem's description. Thus, the program is considered correct.
