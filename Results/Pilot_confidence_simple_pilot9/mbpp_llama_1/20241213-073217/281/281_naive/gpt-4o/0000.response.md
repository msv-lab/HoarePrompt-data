Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses a list comprehension to generate a new list that includes only the even numbers from the input list. The condition `num % 2 == 0` checks whether a number is even. This approach is straightforward and correct for all potential cases.

The code works as follows:

- It iterates over each number `num` in the input list `numbers`.
- For each number, it checks if the remainder of the division of `num` by 2 is 0. If it is, then `num` is even, and it is included in the output list.
- The function returns this list of even numbers.

All provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `[2, 4]`, which are the even numbers in the input list.
- `func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1])` returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, correctly identifying all even numbers, including 0.
- `func_1([8, 12, 15, 19])` returns `[8, 12]`, which are the even numbers in the list.

Since the code handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases like the presence of 0 (which is an even number) in the list, it can be concluded that the program is correct. There are no obvious cases where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description.
