Correctness: **True**.

The provided program uses the built-in `min()` function in Python, which returns the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list). This function works correctly for all non-empty lists of numbers. 

One potential issue could be if the input list is empty, because the `min()` function will raise a `ValueError` in this case. However, the problem description does not specify what the function should do in this case, and it is generally reasonable to assume that the input list is non-empty unless otherwise specified. 

Another potential issue could be if the input list contains non-numeric values, because the `min()` function will also raise a `TypeError` in this case. However, again, the problem description asks for the smallest number in the list, implying that the list should only contain numbers. 

In the absence of any specification about how the function should handle empty lists or non-numeric values, and assuming that the input list is non-empty and contains only numbers, the program works correctly in all cases. 

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description, assuming that the input list is non-empty and contains only numbers.
