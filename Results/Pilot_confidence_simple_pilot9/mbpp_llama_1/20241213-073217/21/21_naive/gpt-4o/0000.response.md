Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function is designed to return the smallest item in an iterable, which in this case is the list of numbers.

The function works correctly for all the provided test cases, and it should work correctly for any list of numbers. The `min` function can handle lists of any size, including empty lists (although it will raise a `ValueError` in this case, which could be considered a potential edge case).

However, based on the problem description, which asks to write a function to find the smallest number in a list, and assuming that the input will always be a non-empty list of numbers, the function works as expected.

One potential edge case is an empty list. If the input list is empty, the `min` function will raise a `ValueError`. If the problem description guaranteed that the input list will never be empty, then this edge case is not relevant. But if the function is expected to handle empty lists, it could be modified to return a specific value, such as `None` or a message indicating that the list is empty.

In general, without considering the edge case of an empty list, the function works correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description.
