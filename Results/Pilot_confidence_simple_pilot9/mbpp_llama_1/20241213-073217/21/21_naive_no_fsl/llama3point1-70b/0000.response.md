Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function is designed to handle lists of numeric elements and returns the smallest element. Since the `min()` function is a standard Python function that is well-tested and well-documented, it is reasonable to assume that it works correctly for all valid inputs.

The function `func_1` does not include any error checking or handling code, but in this case, it is not necessary because the problem description does not specify what should happen if the input is not a list of numbers. However, if the input is a list of numbers, the function will work as expected.

Here are a few examples of how the function works:
- If the input list is `[5, 2, 9]`, the function will return `2`.
- If the input list is `[10, 10, 10]`, the function will return `10`.
- If the input list is `[-1, 0, 1]`, the function will return `-1`.

Since the `min()` function handles all these cases correctly, and there are no edge cases that the code does not handle (such as an empty list or a list containing non-numeric elements), it can be concluded that the function works correctly for all valid inputs. 

However, it's worth noting that the function does not handle the case of an empty list. If an empty list is passed to the function, it will raise a `ValueError`. If you want to handle this case, you could add a simple check at the beginning of the function to return a specific value (such as `None` or a custom error message) when the input list is empty. But based on the problem description alone, it's not clear what the expected behavior should be in this case. 

Despite this, since we can't think of any example where the program does not work as expected according to the provided description (assuming the input is a non-empty list of numbers), the program is correct according to the given problem description.
