Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same or not. It uses the `set()` function to remove duplicate characters from the string. If all characters are the same, the length of the set will be 1. 

This solution handles all potential cases correctly:

- If the string is empty, `set(s)` will also be empty (i.e., `len(set(s))` will be 0), which correctly indicates that not all characters are the same (since there are no characters).
- If the string contains only one unique character, `set(s)` will contain one element, and `len(set(s))` will be 1, correctly indicating that all characters are the same.
- If the string contains multiple unique characters, `set(s)` will contain more than one element, and `len(set(s))` will be greater than 1, correctly indicating that not all characters are the same.

The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It correctly checks whether all characters in a given string are the same or not, according to the problem description.
