Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle. This function correctly implements the problem description, as it accurately calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

The function handles both positive and negative inputs correctly, as the area of a rectangle is defined as the product of its length and width, regardless of the sign of these values. However, it does not include any error checking to handle non-numeric inputs, which could potentially cause issues if the function is called with such inputs.

Despite this potential limitation, based on the provided problem description alone, which only asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, the program is correct. It meets the requirements as stated, and there are no obvious cases where the program does not work as expected according to the description. 

To improve the program's robustness, you could add error handling to ensure that both `length` and `width` are numbers before attempting to calculate the area. But given the problem description and focusing strictly on correctness as defined, the program is correct.
