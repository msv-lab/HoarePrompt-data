Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct as it accurately calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the area of the rectangle. 

All the test cases provided also pass, demonstrating that the function behaves as expected. The code does not have any apparent logical errors or missing edge cases, making it correct according to the problem description. It will work correctly for all positive and non-zero input values of length and width. 

The formula used (area = length * width) is mathematically correct for finding the area of a rectangle, making the program a valid implementation of the problem description.
