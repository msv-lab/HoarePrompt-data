Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly implements the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers `t` and returns a new tuple where each element at index `i` is the product of the elements at indices `i` and `i+1` in the original tuple. 

Here is a breakdown of why the code works correctly:

1. The function uses a generator expression inside the `tuple()` constructor to generate the desired output tuple.
2. The expression `(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))` iterates over the indices of the input tuple `t`, excluding the last one, and multiplies each element with the next one.
3. The `range(len(t) - 1)` ensures that `i + 1` never exceeds the valid index range for `t`, avoiding an `IndexError`.
4. The function handles the edge case where the input tuple has only one element (or no elements), returning an empty tuple as expected.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases, including tuples with different lengths and element values. Since the code correctly implements the problem description and handles potential edge cases, its correctness is confirmed.
