Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(numbers)` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where the i-th element is the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input tuple.

Here is a breakdown of why the code is correct:

- The function uses the `zip` function to pair each element in the input tuple `numbers` with the next one (`numbers[1:]`), effectively creating pairs of adjacent elements.
- It then uses a generator expression to multiply each pair of adjacent elements together.
- The result is converted back into a tuple before being returned, which matches the problem's requirement for the output format.
- The length of the output tuple will be one less than the length of the input tuple because the last element of the input tuple does not have a successor to pair with, which matches the problem's description.

The code correctly handles the edge cases, such as an empty tuple or a tuple with one element, by returning an empty tuple, which aligns with the requirement to return a tuple of length N when the input is of length N+1.

For example, given the input `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, the function correctly returns `(1*2, 2*3, 3*4) = (2, 6, 12)`. 

Overall, the function implements the required behavior as described in the problem statement, and it does so in a way that correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases.
