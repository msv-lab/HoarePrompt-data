Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not work correctly when the size of the lists is odd. In this case, the middle index of the merged list should be the index of the median, which is `size + size - 1` divided by 2 (or simply `2 * size - 1` divided by 2), because Python uses 0-based indexing.

A specific example where the program fails is when `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]` with `size = 2`. In this case, the merged list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Since the total size is 4 (even), the program should calculate the median as the average of the two middle numbers, which are 2 and 3. However, the program will calculate the median as the average of 3 and 4, which are the numbers at indices `size - 1` and `size`, resulting in an incorrect median of 3.5 instead of the correct median of 2.5.

Here's a correct version of the program:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    total_size = 2 * size
    middle_index = total_size // 2
    if total_size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
In this corrected version, I've changed the calculation of `middle_index` to `total_size // 2`, and adjusted the indices accordingly to correctly handle both even and odd total sizes.
