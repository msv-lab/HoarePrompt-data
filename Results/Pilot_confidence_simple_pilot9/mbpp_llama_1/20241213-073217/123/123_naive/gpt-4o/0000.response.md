Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the provided integer `L`. It uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this. The expression `lst[:L]` creates a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and `lst[L:]` creates a new list containing the remaining elements of `lst`.

The function handles various cases correctly:

- When `L` is less than the length of the list, it splits the list into two parts of length `L` and the remaining elements.
- When `L` is equal to the length of the list, it returns a tuple containing the original list and an empty list.
- When `L` is greater than the length of the list, it still works as expected, returning the original list and an empty list (since `lst[L:]` will be an empty list).

The unit tests provided also support this conclusion, demonstrating the function's correctness for different input scenarios.

Overall, based on the problem description and the function's implementation, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
