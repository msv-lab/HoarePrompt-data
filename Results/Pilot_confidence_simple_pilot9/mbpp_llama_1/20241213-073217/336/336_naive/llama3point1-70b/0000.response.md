Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(lst)` checks whether every odd index in a given list `lst` contains an odd number. The function iterates over the list using a for loop, checking each index `i` and its corresponding value `lst[i]`. If the index `i` is odd (`i % 2!= 0`) and the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), the function immediately returns `False`.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

* If all odd indices in the list contain odd numbers, the function returns `True`.
* If any odd index in the list contains an even number, the function returns `False`.
* The function works correctly for lists of any length, including empty lists.
* The function also works correctly for lists with a single element, regardless of whether the index is even or odd.

Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description for all potential cases, I conclude that it is correct.
