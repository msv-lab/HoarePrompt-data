Correctness: **True**

The provided code is correct because it checks every odd index of the input list to ensure that it contains an odd number. The function `func_1` uses a loop with a step size of 2, starting from index 1, to iterate over the odd indices of the list. For each odd index, it checks if the number at that index is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If any odd index contains an even number, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

The unit tests provided also validate the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` returns `True` because all odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) contain odd numbers (1, 3, 7, 3). Another example, `func_1([1, 2, 3])`, returns `False` because index 1 is an odd index and it contains an even number (2), which is the expected behavior.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code handles lists of varying lengths and correctly identifies whether every odd index contains an odd number.
