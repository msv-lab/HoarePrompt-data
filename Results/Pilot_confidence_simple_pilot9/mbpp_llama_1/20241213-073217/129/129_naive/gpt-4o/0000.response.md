Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function. This function works correctly for all possible character inputs, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

The `ord` function is a standard Python function that returns the Unicode code point for a one-character string. Since the ASCII character set is a subset of the Unicode character set, `ord` will return the correct ASCII values for characters within the ASCII range (0-127).

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to behave incorrectly. The function does not perform any error checking or handling, but this is not necessary since the `ord` function will throw a `TypeError` if the input is not a one-character string.

The provided unit tests (`assert func_1('A') == 65`, `assert func_1('R') == 82`, `assert func_1('S') == 83`) demonstrate the function's correctness for specific inputs, but the function's behavior is consistent and correct for all possible character inputs.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is considered correct.
