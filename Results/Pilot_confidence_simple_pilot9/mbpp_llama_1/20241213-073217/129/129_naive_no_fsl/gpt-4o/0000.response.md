Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the ASCII value of a character. The function utilizes the built-in Python function `ord()`, which returns the Unicode code point for a one-character string, effectively giving the ASCII value for characters within the ASCII range.

This function is correct for every potential case because `ord()` handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, returning their respective ASCII values. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate this functionality for specific characters.

For example, `func_1('A')` correctly returns `65`, which is the ASCII value for 'A'. Similarly, `func_1('R')` and `func_1('S')` return `82` and `83`, respectively, which are the ASCII values for 'R' and 'S'.

The function is robust and works as expected for any single-character string passed to it. It does not have any visible edge cases that would cause it to fail according to the problem description, as `ord()` is designed to handle single characters and return their Unicode code points, which, for ASCII characters, are their ASCII values.
