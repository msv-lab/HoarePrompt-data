Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. This function works correctly for all possible single character inputs.

The `ord()` function in Python returns an integer representing the Unicode character. Since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, `ord()` works perfectly for finding ASCII values. 

The given function does not handle cases where the input is not a single character, but the problem description does not specify what should happen in such cases. However, considering the description "A single character", it can be inferred that the function is intended for single characters only, and it does its job correctly for all single characters. 

If the program were intended to handle cases where the input is not a single character (like strings of length more than 1 or non-string inputs), the function would need to include error checking code to handle these cases. But based on the problem description provided, the function works as intended. 

Therefore, without considering potential edge cases not mentioned in the problem description (like handling non-string or multi-character inputs), the program works correctly for its specified purpose.
