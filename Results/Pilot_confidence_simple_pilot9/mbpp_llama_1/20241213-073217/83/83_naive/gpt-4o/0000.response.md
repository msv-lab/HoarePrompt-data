Correctness: **False**.

The code provided attempts to sort a list of elements, but it contains several issues. 

1. The `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are using a variable `arr`, which is not defined within their scope. They should be using the array that is passed to `func_1`.

2. Even if the `arr` variable was correctly passed to `find_max_index` and `flip`, the algorithm would not correctly sort the list. The code seems to be implementing a modified version of selection sort or pancake sort, but it is not correctly implemented. The `flip` function is used to move the maximum element to the end of the current subarray, but it is not correctly used in the context of the `func_1` function.

3. The `find_max_index` function only finds the index of the maximum element in the subarray from index 0 to `n-1`, but it does not correctly move the maximum element to the end of the subarray.

A correct version of the code would need to correctly implement a sorting algorithm, such as selection sort, bubble sort, or insertion sort.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input: `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]`
Expected output: `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]`
Actual output: The program will throw a `NameError` because `arr` is not defined in the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions. Even if `arr` was correctly passed, the output would still be incorrect because of the flawed algorithm. 

To correctly solve the problem, the code should be modified to correctly implement a sorting algorithm. For example, a modified version of the selection sort algorithm could be used:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
    return arr
```
