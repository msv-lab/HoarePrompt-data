Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct as it meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element as input, checks if the element is in the array, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating the presence of the element and its index position (or -1 if not found).

The program uses the built-in `index` method of Python lists, which raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found. This exception is caught and handled by returning `(False, -1)`, which is in line with the problem description.

The program works correctly for the following cases:
- When the element is present in the array: It returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element.
- When the element is not present in the array: It returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`.
- When the array is empty: It raises a `ValueError` exception when trying to access an element, which is caught and handled correctly, returning `(False, -1)`.
- When the element is `None` or any other type of object: The program works as expected, checking for presence and returning the correct result.

Since all possible cases are handled correctly according to the problem description, the program is considered correct.
