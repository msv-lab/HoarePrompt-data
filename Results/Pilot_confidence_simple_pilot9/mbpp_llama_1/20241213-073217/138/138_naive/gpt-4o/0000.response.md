Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to take in an array and an element, then return a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). 

Here's why I believe the code is correct:

1. **Element found in array**: The function iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which returns both the index and the value of each element. If the value matches the target element, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. This matches the problem description for the case where the element is found.

2. **Element not found in array**: If the function iterates over the entire array without finding the target element, it returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`. This also matches the problem description for the case where the element is not found.

3. **Empty array**: Although not explicitly stated in the problem description, the function will correctly handle an empty array by returning `(False, -1)`, since the loop will not execute and thus will not find the element.

4. **Edge cases**: The function does not have any apparent issues with edge cases, such as duplicate elements or a single-element array, as the `enumerate` function will iterate over each element correctly.

5. **Input validation**: While the function does not explicitly validate its inputs (e.g., checking that the input is a list and the element is a valid value), the problem description does not specify input validation as a requirement. If input validation were required, the function would need to be modified accordingly.

Overall, based on the problem description and the provided code, I believe the function is correct and will behave as expected for all potential inputs.
