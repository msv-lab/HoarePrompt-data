Correctness: **True**

The given program is a simple implementation of a function that checks if an element exists in an array and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating its presence and the index position of the element. 

The function iterates over the array using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index and the value of each element in the array. If the current element matches the target element, it immediately returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element.

If the function iterates over the entire array without finding a match, it returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`, indicating that the element is not present in the array.

This implementation correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- When the element is present in the array, it returns the correct index.
- When the element is not present in the array, it returns `False` and `-1`.
- When the array is empty, the function will correctly return `(False, -1)` because the `for` loop will not execute and the function will return the default value.
- When the element is at the start or end of the array, the function will also work correctly.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
