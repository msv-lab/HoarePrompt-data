Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is one where the digits alternate between two different digits. The function first converts the number into a string to easily access each digit. It then checks if the length of the string is less than 3, in which case it returns `False` because an undulating number must have at least 3 digits.

The function then checks if the first two digits are the same, returning `False` if they are, because an undulating number must start with two different digits. It then iterates over the rest of the digits, checking if each even-indexed digit is the same as the first digit, and if each odd-indexed digit is the same as the second digit. If it finds any digit that does not match this pattern, it returns `False`. If it checks all the digits without finding any that do not match the pattern, it returns `True`.

The provided unit tests suggest that the function is working as expected. For example, the number 1212121 is undulating because it alternates between the digits 1 and 2, so the function correctly returns `True`. The number 1991 is not undulating because it does not alternate between two different digits, so the function correctly returns `False`.

I could not find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
