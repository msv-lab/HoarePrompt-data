Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function, `func_1`, takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as input, and it returns the total count of occurrences of all elements in the list within the tuple. 

The code uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples to count the occurrences of each element in the tuple, and then sums up these counts using a generator expression.

The function appears to correctly implement the problem description. It handles various edge cases, such as when the tuple or the list is empty, or when the list contains multiple occurrences of the same element.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness, covering different scenarios with string and integer elements.

There do not appear to be any obvious edge cases where the function would fail to work as expected, such as when the input tuple contains duplicated elements, or when the list contains elements that are not present in the tuple.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
