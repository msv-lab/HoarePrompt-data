Correctness: **False**.

The program is trying to extract the elementwise AND operation between two tuples. However, it does not handle the case when the two tuples are of different lengths. 

For example, if we have `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, and the result will be `(1 & 4, 2 & 5)`, which is `(0, 0)`. The elements from the longer tuple (`3` in this case) will be ignored.

Another issue with the program is that the description asks for the extraction of elementwise AND operation and also tuples, but the program only does the elementwise AND operation. It does not handle the extraction of tuples.

To make the program correct, we need to add error checking to ensure that the two tuples are of the same length, and we need to modify the program to handle the extraction of tuples if required. 

Here is a possible corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    if len(tup1)!= len(tup2):
        raise ValueError("The two tuples must be of the same length")
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```
