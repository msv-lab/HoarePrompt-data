Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description correctly. The problem description asks for a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided code performs an element-wise bitwise AND operation between the two tuples using the `&` operator, which does not match the problem description.

A correct implementation would compare the elements of the two tuples and return a tuple of values based on the comparison. For example, it could return 1 if the corresponding element in the first tuple is greater, 0 if it is less, and the difference if the elements are equal.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:
```python
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 9))!= (1, 1, 1, 0)
```
In this case, the program returns `(0, 0, 2, 9)` which is incorrect because it's performing a bitwise AND operation instead of comparing the elements and returning the expected result. 

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to compare the elements and return the expected result. Here is an example of a function that would correctly compare the elements:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(1 if a > b else 0 if a < b else a - b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
