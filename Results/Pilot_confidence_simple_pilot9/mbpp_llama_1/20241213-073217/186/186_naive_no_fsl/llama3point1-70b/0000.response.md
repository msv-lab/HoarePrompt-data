Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(tup1, tup2)` is supposed to extract the element-wise operations of the given two tuples, but it only performs a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between corresponding elements.

However, the problem statement does not specify that only bitwise AND operation should be performed. It mentions "elementwise and tuples", which could be interpreted as performing a logical AND operation (`and`) between corresponding elements of the tuples, assuming these elements are boolean values, or it could imply a more generic operation depending on the context. The function given does not cover the full range of potential "element-wise" operations that might be intended or needed.

Moreover, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input tuples are of different lengths. The `zip` function in Python stops once the shortest input iterable is exhausted, potentially leading to a loss of data if one tuple is longer than the other. This might not be the intended behavior if the problem requires handling tuples of varying lengths in a specific way (e.g., padding the shorter tuple with a default value, raising an error, etc.).

An example where the program does not work as expected could be when the tuples contain non-integer values that do not support bitwise operations, or when the intention is to perform a logical AND operation between boolean values:

```python
tup1 = (True, False)
tup2 = (True, True)
```

In this case, the function would not return the expected result of `(True, False)`, because the `&` operator does not perform a logical AND operation on boolean values in the way that the `and` keyword does. Instead, it would attempt to perform a bitwise AND, which is not applicable or meaningful for boolean values in the context of the `&` operator. 

Additionally, consider a scenario where the tuples are of different lengths or contain different data types for which bitwise operations are not defined. In such cases, the function might either fail or produce unexpected results, highlighting the need for more comprehensive error handling or type checking to ensure it behaves as intended across a broader range of inputs.
