Correctness: **True**

The given program is a Python function `func_1` that takes a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The function uses a list comprehension to apply the built-in `sorted` function to each sublist.

The program works correctly for all the provided test cases, and it is expected to work correctly for all potential cases. The reason is that the `sorted` function in Python is stable and works correctly for lists of strings. It sorts the strings based on their Unicode code points, which for English letters is their alphabetical order.

Here are a few reasons why the program is correct:

* The function handles lists of lists of varying lengths, as shown in the test cases.
* The function handles lists of strings with varying lengths and contents.
* The function correctly sorts each sublist in ascending order.

Since the `sorted` function is a built-in Python function, it is expected to work correctly for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct, and it is expected to work correctly for all potential cases.

It's worth noting that the program assumes that the input is a list of lists of strings. If the input can contain other types of data, the program may not work correctly. However, based on the problem description and the provided test cases, it appears that the input is expected to be a list of lists of strings.
