Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` is designed to sort each sublist of strings in a list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and applies the built-in `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument to ensure case-insensitive sorting.

The function handles the task correctly for all potential cases. It can handle:

1. Empty sublists: The function will simply return an empty list for empty sublists, as there's nothing to sort.
2. Single-element sublists: The function will return the original sublist, as a single-element list is already sorted.
3. Sublists with duplicate elements: The function will sort the sublists correctly, even if there are duplicate elements.
4. Sublists with elements in different cases: The function will sort the sublists correctly, ignoring the case of the elements due to the `key=str.lower` argument.

Overall, the function is correct and will work as expected for any input list of lists of strings. There are no edge cases that the function does not handle, and it will always return the correct sorted sublists.
