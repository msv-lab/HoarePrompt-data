Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it successfully merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into a single list `combined_list`, and then sorts this list using the built-in `sorted` function in Python. The sorted list is then returned.

The program handles various cases, including lists with duplicate elements, lists with negative numbers (although none of the test cases include negative numbers, the `sorted` function in Python can handle negative numbers), and lists of different lengths. The `sorted` function sorts the combined list in ascending order, which is the expected behavior.

All the provided test cases demonstrate the correct functionality of the program, and based on the code provided, there doesn't appear to be any case where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
