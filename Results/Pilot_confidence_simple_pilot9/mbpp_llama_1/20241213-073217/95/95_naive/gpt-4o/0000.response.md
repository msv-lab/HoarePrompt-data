Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of occurrences of a substring in the string. In this case, it correctly counts the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in the given string `s`. 

The function is case-sensitive, so it will only count occurrences of 'std' in lowercase. However, the problem description does not specify that the function should be case-insensitive, so this behavior is not necessarily incorrect.

The unit tests provided also suggest that the function is working as expected. They cover various scenarios, including strings with multiple occurrences of 'std', strings with only one occurrence, and an empty string. 

Since I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the description, I conclude that the program is correct.
