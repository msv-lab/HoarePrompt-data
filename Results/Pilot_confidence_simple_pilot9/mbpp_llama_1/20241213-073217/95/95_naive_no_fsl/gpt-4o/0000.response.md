Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string. The function utilizes the built-in string method `count`, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specified value in the string. 

This function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty strings: It correctly returns 0 when the input string is empty.
- Strings with no occurrences of 'std': It returns 0, indicating that 'std' does not appear in the string.
- Strings with one or more occurrences of 'std': It accurately counts the number of times 'std' appears.
- Overlapping occurrences of 'std': Although not explicitly stated, it's worth noting that `count` in Python does not count overlapping occurrences. For example, if the string were 'stdstd', it would count only 1 occurrence of 'std', not 2. However, this is actually the correct behavior as per standard string matching rules where 'std' cannot overlap itself in a string. 

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios. Since I couldn't find any potential case where the program doesn't work as expected according to the problem description, the program is considered correct.
