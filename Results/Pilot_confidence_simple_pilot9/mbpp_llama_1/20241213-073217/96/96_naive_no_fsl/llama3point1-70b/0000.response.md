Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks if all elements in a given tuple have the same data type. This function works by using a set comprehension to generate a set of the types of all elements in the tuple. In Python, a set automatically removes duplicate values, so if all elements in the tuple have the same type, the set will contain only one element. The function then checks if the length of this set is equal to 1, returning `True` if it is (indicating all elements have the same type) and `False` otherwise.

The program correctly handles various potential cases, including but not limited to:

1. **Tuples with elements of the same type:** For example, `(1, 2, 3)` or `('a', 'b', 'c')`.
2. **Tuples with elements of different types:** For example, `(1, 'a', 3.5)` or `('a', 2, True)`.
3. **Empty tuples:** The function should return `True` for an empty tuple because there are no elements with different types.
4. **Tuples with nested structures:** For example, `((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))` or `({'a': 1}, {'b': 2}, {'c': 3})`. Each element in the tuple could itself be a complex structure, but as long as all these structures are of the same type (e.g., all are tuples, all are dictionaries), the function will correctly return `True`.

The function is concise, readable, and correctly implements the described functionality. It does not miss any edge cases that could cause it to fail according to the provided problem description. Therefore, based on the given information and considering the function's logic, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.
