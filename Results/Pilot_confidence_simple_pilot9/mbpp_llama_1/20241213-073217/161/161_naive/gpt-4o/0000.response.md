Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1(n)` calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point: 2 and 1, instead of 0 and 1. The function uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number, starting from the base cases of `func_1(0)` returning 2 and `func_1(1)` returning 1. 

For `n > 1`, the function initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1) and then iteratively updates these variables `n-1` times to calculate the n'th Lucas number. 

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) verify that the function returns the correct results for specific inputs. After analyzing the function and considering different possible inputs, it appears that the function correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number for all non-negative integers `n`. 

There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to return an incorrect result. The function handles the base cases correctly, and the iterative approach ensures that the function can calculate the n'th Lucas number for any non-negative integer `n`. Therefore, the function seems to be correct, and the correctness is **True**.
