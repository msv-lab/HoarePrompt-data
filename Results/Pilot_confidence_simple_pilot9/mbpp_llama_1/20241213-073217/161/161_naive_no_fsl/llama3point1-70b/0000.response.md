Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be a correct implementation of a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is a series of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point. The first two numbers in the Lucas sequence are 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Base Cases**: The function correctly handles the base cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1`, returning 2 and 1 respectively.
2. **Recursive Formula**: The program uses a loop to iteratively calculate the n'th Lucas number using the recursive formula `(a, b) = (b, a + b)`, where `a` and `b` are the previous two numbers in the sequence.
3. **Correct Calculation**: The loop runs from 2 to `n + 1`, ensuring that the n'th Lucas number is correctly calculated.

The program does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. It handles both the base cases and the recursive formula correctly, and the loop ensures that the calculation is performed correctly for any positive integer `n`.

To verify this, you can test the function with various inputs, such as:

* `func_1(0)` should return 2
* `func_1(1)` should return 1
* `func_1(2)` should return 3
* `func_1(3)` should return 4
* `func_1(4)` should return 7

All of these test cases should produce the correct results, confirming that the program is correct.
