Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct because it accurately implements the formula to convert degrees to radians. The formula is `radians = degrees * (Ï€ / 180)`, which is correctly implemented in the `func_1` function.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs, including 90, 60, and 120 degrees. These tests cover a range of values and help to validate that the function behaves as expected.

Additionally, the use of the `math.pi` constant ensures that the conversion factor is accurate and consistent.

Since I couldn't find any edge cases or potential inputs where the program would not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct. It correctly implements the conversion formula and passes the provided unit tests, making it a robust and reliable implementation of a degrees-to-radians converter.
