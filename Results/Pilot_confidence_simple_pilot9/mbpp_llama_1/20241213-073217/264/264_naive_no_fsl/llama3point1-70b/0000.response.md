Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(deg)` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input degree by `math.pi` and dividing by 180. This is a fundamental conversion formula between these two angle units.

The function should work correctly for all real number inputs, including positive, negative, and zero degrees. There are no obvious edge cases where the function would not behave as expected, as the division by 180 is a constant operation and `math.pi` is a known constant in the math library.

Examples where the function works as expected include:

- Converting 0 degrees to radians: `func_1(0)` should return `0.0`
- Converting 90 degrees to radians: `func_1(90)` should return approximately `1.5707963267948966`
- Converting 360 degrees to radians: `func_1(360)` should return approximately `6.283185307179586`
- Converting negative degrees: `func_1(-90)` should return approximately `-1.5707963267948966`

Given that the function follows the basic mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians and there are no missing logic or edge cases identified, the correctness of the function is confirmed.
