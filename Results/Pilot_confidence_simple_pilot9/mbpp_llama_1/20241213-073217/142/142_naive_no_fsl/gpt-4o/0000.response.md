Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. It iterates through each item in the list, and if it finds an item that is not equal to the given element, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any items that are not equal to the given element, it returns `True`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue')` returns `False` because not all items in the list are equal to `'blue'`. Similarly, `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7)` returns `False` because not all items in the list are equal to `7`. On the other hand, `func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green')` returns `True` because all items in the list are equal to `'green'`.

After examining the code and the problem description, I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles lists of different lengths and data types, and it returns the expected result for various inputs. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
