Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` appears to be correct. It finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function works by continuously generating triangular numbers and checking their length until it finds one with `n` digits.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The function starts with `k = 1`, which is the index of the first triangular number.
2. It then enters a loop where it generates the `k`-th triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
3. The function checks the length of the generated triangular number by converting it to a string and using the `len()` function.
4. If the length of the triangular number matches the input `n`, the function returns `k`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.
5. If the length does not match, the function increments `k` by 1 and repeats the process.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also suggest that the function works correctly for different inputs.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. The function seems to handle all possible inputs correctly, and the logic is sound. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
