Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1(s)` checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word, by splitting the string into words and then iterating over each word. For each word, it checks if the word has a length greater than 1 (to ensure 'z' is not at the start or end) and if 'z' is present in the substring excluding the first and last characters. If it finds such a word, it immediately returns `True`. If it doesn't find any such words after checking all words, it returns `False`. 

This approach correctly handles all potential cases:

1. **Words with 'z' in the middle:** The function will return `True` as expected because it checks the substring excluding the first and last characters of each word.
2. **Words without 'z':** The function will correctly not return `True` for these words, as the condition for returning `True` is not met.
3. **Words that start or end with 'z':** Since the function checks the substring from index 1 to -1 (excluding the last character), 'z' at the start or end of a word is correctly ignored.
4. **Single-character words:** These are correctly handled by the condition `len(word) > 1`, ensuring 'z' in single-character words does not trigger a false positive.
5. **Empty string or strings with only spaces:** The `split()` method will return an empty list if the string is empty or contains only spaces, and the function will correctly return `False` without attempting to access any characters.
6. **Edge cases like null or non-string inputs:** While the function does not explicitly check for these, in Python, passing a non-string input to `split()` or attempting to iterate over a non-iterable would raise an exception. However, based on the problem description, the input is assumed to be a string.

Overall, the function accurately implements the required functionality for all potential cases.
