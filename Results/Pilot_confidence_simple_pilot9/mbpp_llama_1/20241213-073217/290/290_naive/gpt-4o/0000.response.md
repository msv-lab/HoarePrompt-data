Correctness: **True**.

The provided code checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. This is achieved by slicing the string from index 1 to -1, effectively removing the first and last characters, and then checking if 'z' is present in the resulting substring.

The code works correctly because it handles all edge cases:

* If 'z' is at the start or end of the string, it will not be included in the sliced substring `s[1:-1]`, so the function will return `False` as expected.
* If 'z' is not present at all in the string, the `in` operator will return `False`, so the function will return `False` as expected.
* If 'z' is present anywhere in the middle of the string, the `in` operator will return `True`, so the function will return `True` as expected.

The provided unit tests also validate this behavior:

* `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the middle of the string.
* `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.
* `func_1('  lang .')` returns `False` because 'z' is not present at all in the string.

Since the code handles all possible cases correctly, it is considered correct.
