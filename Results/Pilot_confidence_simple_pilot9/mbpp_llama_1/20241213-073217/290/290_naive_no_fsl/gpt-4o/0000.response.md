Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it checks if the string 'z' is present in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters. The condition `'z' in s[1:-1]` correctly implements this check. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

- The `[1:-1]` slice extracts all characters from the string except the first and last ones.
- The `in` operator checks if 'z' is present in this substring.
- If 'z' is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that 'z' is present in the string (except at the start and end).
- If 'z' is not found, the function returns `False`, indicating that 'z' is not present in the string (except at the start and end).

The program correctly handles various edge cases, such as strings where 'z' is only at the start or end, and strings where 'z' is not present at all. 

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program for different scenarios. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is verified.
