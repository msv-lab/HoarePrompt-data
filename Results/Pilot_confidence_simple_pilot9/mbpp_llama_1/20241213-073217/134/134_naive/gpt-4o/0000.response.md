Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients of a given positive integer `n`. This function utilizes the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients in a binomial expansion is equal to `2^(n-1)`. 

To understand why this property holds, consider the binomial expansion of `(1+1)^n`, which is equal to `2^n`. Now, if we expand `(1-1)^n`, all the terms with even powers of 1 will add up to `2^(n-1)` and the terms with odd powers of 1 will cancel out.

The provided code correctly implements this mathematical property and, as a result, it calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given `n`. The unit tests provided also confirm the correctness of this implementation for different inputs.

Therefore, the function `func_1(n)` works correctly for all positive integers `n`, and thus, the program is correct.
