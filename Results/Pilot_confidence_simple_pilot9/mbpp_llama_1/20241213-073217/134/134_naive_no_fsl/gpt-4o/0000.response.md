Correctness: **True**

The given Python program calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients using the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients of order n is equal to 2^(n-1). This property is based on the symmetry of Pascal's triangle and the fact that each entry in Pascal's triangle is a binomial coefficient.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(4) == 8`, `assert func_1(6) == 32`, and `assert func_1(2) == 2`, demonstrate that the function is working correctly for different inputs.

After analyzing the code, it appears that the function is correctly implementing the mathematical formula for the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The function does not contain any loops or conditional statements that could potentially cause it to fail for certain inputs. 

Therefore, the code seems to be correct and should work as expected for all positive integer inputs.
