Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates over the array in reverse order, and as soon as it finds the target element `x`, it returns the index of that element. If the element is not found after iterating over the entire array, the function returns -1.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs, including arrays with duplicate elements. The function's approach ensures that it finds the last occurrence of the target element, which aligns with the problem description.

Since the array is sorted, the last occurrence of an element is indeed the last index at which the element appears when iterating from the end of the array towards the beginning. The function's reverse iteration strategy efficiently finds this last occurrence without needing to iterate over the entire array if the target element appears early in the reverse iteration.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, including arrays with duplicate elements and arrays where the target element does not exist, it appears that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed **True**.
