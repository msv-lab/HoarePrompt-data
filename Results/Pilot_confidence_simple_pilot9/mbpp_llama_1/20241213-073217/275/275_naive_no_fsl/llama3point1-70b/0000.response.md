Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, which is correct because an empty list does not contain any numbers.

2. The function then sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. This is done to ensure that for each number in the list, all its potential divisors are considered before it. This is necessary because the dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the function relies on previously computed values.

3. The function initializes a DP array `dp` of size equal to the length of the list `nums`. Each element `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset that ends with `nums[i]` and has the property that every pair is divisible.

4. The function then iterates over the list `nums`. For each number `nums[i]`, it checks all previous numbers `nums[j]`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it means that `nums[j]` can be a divisor of `nums[i]` in the subset. Therefore, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `dp[j] + 1` represents the size of the subset that ends with `nums[i]` and includes `nums[j]` as a divisor.

5. Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the DP array `dp`, which represents the size of the largest subset that has the property that every pair is divisible.

This approach correctly solves the problem because it considers all possible subsets of the list `nums` and checks whether each subset has the property that every pair is divisible. It also correctly handles the case where the input list is empty, and it correctly handles the case where the list contains duplicate numbers.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the length of the list `nums`, because it uses two nested loops to iterate over the list. The space complexity is O(n), because it uses a DP array of size equal to the length of the list `nums`.
