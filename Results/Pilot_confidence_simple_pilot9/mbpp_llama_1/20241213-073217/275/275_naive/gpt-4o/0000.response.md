Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the concept of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible. It uses dynamic programming to efficiently solve the problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Handling empty list**: The function correctly handles an empty list by returning 0, which is the expected result.

2. **Sorting the list**: The function sorts the input list in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the function to efficiently check for divisibility between pairs of numbers.

3. **Dynamic programming**: The function uses a dynamic programming approach, initializing an array `dp` with 1s, where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset ending at index `i`.

4. **Checking divisibility**: The function iterates through the sorted list and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the larger number is divisible by the smaller number. If it is, the function updates `dp[i]` with the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the smaller number.

5. **Returning the maximum subset size**: The function returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset of numbers where every pair is divisible.

After analyzing the code, it seems to correctly handle all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists
- Lists with a single element
- Lists with multiple elements
- Lists with duplicate elements
- Lists with elements that are not divisible by each other

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. Therefore, based on the analysis, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
