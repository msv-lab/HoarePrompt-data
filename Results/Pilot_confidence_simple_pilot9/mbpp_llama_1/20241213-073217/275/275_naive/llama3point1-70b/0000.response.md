Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(nums)` is designed to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible. The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty, in which case it returns 0. It then sorts the list in ascending order.

The function uses dynamic programming (DP) to solve the problem. It initializes a DP array `dp` of the same length as the input list, where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset ending at index `i`. The DP array is initialized with all elements set to 1, as a single number is always a subset of size 1.

The function then iterates over the sorted list, and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the current number `nums[i]` is divisible by the previous number `nums[j]`. If it is, the function updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, which represents the size of the largest subset ending at index `j` plus one (the current number).

Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the DP array, which represents the size of the largest subset of numbers where every pair is divisible.

The function handles edge cases correctly, such as an empty input list or a list with a single element. It also correctly handles cases where the input list contains duplicate numbers or numbers that are not divisible by each other.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]`, the function will return 5, as all numbers in the list are divisible by each other. If the input list is `[1, 3, 6, 12]`, the function will return 4, as all numbers in the list are divisible by each other.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
