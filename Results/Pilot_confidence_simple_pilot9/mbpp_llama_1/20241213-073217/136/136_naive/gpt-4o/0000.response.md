Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function, `func_1`, filters a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to a specified integer `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to achieve this, iterating over each key-value pair in the dictionary and including it in the new dictionary only if the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

The function handles the problem description correctly for all potential cases. It correctly filters the dictionary based on the specified condition and returns a new dictionary with the filtered entries. It does not modify the original dictionary and handles cases where the input dictionary is empty or where no entries meet the filter condition.

Additionally, the provided unit tests demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, including different threshold values and dictionaries with multiple entries. Since no potential cases have been found where the program does not work as expected, the function is considered correct.
