Correctness: **False**.

The reason this code is considered incorrect is that it does not fully meet the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the line `list1 = list2` does not have the desired effect in the context of the function because it only changes the local reference `list1` to point to `list2`, but does not modify the original `list1` outside the function. 

For example, if you call `list1 = []; func_1(list1, [1, 2, 3])`, `list1` will still be an empty list `[]` after the function call. However, according to the problem description, the function should replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. Since the first list is empty, it should be replaced with the second list. 

To fix this issue, the function should return `list2` when `list1` is empty. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    return list1 if list1 else list2
```
