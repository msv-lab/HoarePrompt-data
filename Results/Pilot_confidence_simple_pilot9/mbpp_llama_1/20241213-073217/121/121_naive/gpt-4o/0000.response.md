Correctness: **False**.

The problem description asks for a function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, but the provided program does not generate prime numbers or implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams algorithm. The function provided seems to be implementing a recursive relation to generate numbers in a sequence, but it does not check for primality.

The Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers that are defined by a specific formula. However, the given function does not follow this formula or generate prime numbers. Instead, it appears to be generating numbers in a sequence that does not correspond to the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers.

A simple test case to demonstrate the incorrectness of this function would be to check if the generated numbers are indeed prime. For example, the function `func_1(1)` returns `1`, which is not a prime number. Another example is `func_1(2)` returns `1`, which is also not a prime number.

The correct implementation of a function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number would involve generating prime numbers using the Newman–Shanks–Williams algorithm and returning the nth prime number in the sequence. The given function does not meet this requirement and therefore is incorrect.
