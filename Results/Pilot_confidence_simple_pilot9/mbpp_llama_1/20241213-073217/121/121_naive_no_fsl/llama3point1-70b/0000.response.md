Correctness: **True**

The program provided is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. A Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The program correctly implements this definition.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. `func_1(n)` checks if a number `n` is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of `n`. This is an efficient method for checking primality.

2. `func_2(n)` starts from 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and checks each subsequent number to see if it is prime and congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. It increments a counter each time it finds such a number, and returns the number when the counter reaches `n`.

The code correctly handles the base case where `n` is 1, returning 7 as expected.

For other values of `n`, the program will continue to check numbers until it finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, correctly incrementing the counter and returning the correct prime number.

The program does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly. It correctly checks for primality and the modulo condition, and it should work as expected for all positive integers `n`.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the program correctly implements the required functionality, and I was unable to find any potential cases where it does not work as expected.
