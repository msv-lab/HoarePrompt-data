Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` appears to correctly implement the problem description. It converts the input integer `n` to a string `str_n` to easily iterate over each digit. Then, for each digit, it counts the occurrences of that digit in the string using `str_n.count(digit)` and checks if this count is less than or equal to the digit itself (converted back to an integer with `int(digit)`). If any digit's frequency exceeds the digit, the function immediately returns `False`. If it checks all digits without finding any such condition, it returns `True`, indicating that the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself.

This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, including edge cases like single-digit numbers, numbers with repeated digits, and numbers with digits that are zero (since the count of '0' would be compared to the integer 0, correctly handling this edge case). 

For example, if you input `121`, the function will correctly identify that the frequency of '1' is 2, which is less than or equal to the digit '1' itself, and the frequency of '2' is 1, which is also less than or equal to the digit '2', so it will return `True`. 

Given the problem description and the provided code, there doesn't appear to be any potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
