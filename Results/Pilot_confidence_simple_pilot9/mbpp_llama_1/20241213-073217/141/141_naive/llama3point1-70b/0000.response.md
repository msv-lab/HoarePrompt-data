Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself. It works by first converting the integer to a string `str_n`, then iterating over each character `digit` in the string. For each digit, it uses the `count` method to find the number of occurrences of that digit in the string. If the count is greater than the digit itself (converted back to an integer with `int(digit)`), the function immediately returns `False`.

If the function iterates over all digits without finding any with a count greater than themselves, it returns `True`, indicating that the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself.

This logic is sound and should work correctly for all possible inputs. For example, if the input is 121, the function will check that the frequency of '1' (2) is less than or equal to 1 (which is false), and return False. If the input is 1221, the function will check that the frequency of '1' (2) is less than or equal to 1 (which is false), and return False. However, if the input is 12, the function will check the frequencies of '1' and '2' and return True, because both frequencies are 1, which is less than or equal to the digits themselves.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
