Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a Python function named `func_1` which takes two lists (or tuples, as shown in the example asserts) as input and returns a tuple of shared elements from both lists. The function uses Python's built-in `set` data type to find the intersection of the two input lists, which is a very efficient way to find common elements.

The function works as follows:
- It converts both input lists into sets using `set(list1)` and `set(list2)`. This automatically removes any duplicate elements within each list.
- It then uses the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives a new set containing only the elements that are common to both.
- Finally, it converts this resulting set back into a tuple and sorts it before returning it.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists, regardless of their original order or whether they contained duplicates. The use of `sorted` ensures that the output tuple is always in a consistent order, which can be useful for further processing or comparison.

Given the problem description and the provided code, every potential case seems to be handled correctly: finding common elements, handling duplicate elements, and maintaining a consistent output order. Without finding a specific case where the code does not work as expected, it's reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.
