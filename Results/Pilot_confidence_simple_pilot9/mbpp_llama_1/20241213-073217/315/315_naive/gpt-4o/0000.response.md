Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program is designed to add the given tuple to the given list. It uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the tuple after converting the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)`. This approach ensures that the resulting list contains all elements from both the original list and the tuple.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correct functionality of the program. The function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as input and returns a new list that includes all elements from the input list followed by the elements of the tuple.

Here's a breakdown of why the code works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Conversion of Tuple to List**: By using `list(tpl)`, the tuple is successfully converted into a list, which can then be concatenated with the input list.
2. **Concatenation**: The `+` operator is used for list concatenation in Python, which works as expected in this case.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new list object that includes all elements from both the input list and the tuple. This means the original list remains unchanged, and a new list with the combined elements is returned.

Given the provided assertions and analyzing the code's behavior, there are no apparent cases where the program fails to meet the problem description. The code correctly handles the addition of a tuple to a list and returns the resulting list, making it a correct implementation.
