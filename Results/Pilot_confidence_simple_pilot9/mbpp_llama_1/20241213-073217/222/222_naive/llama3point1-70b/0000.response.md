Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not correctly implement the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. It simply iterates over each character in the string and checks if it is an uppercase letter. If it is, the character is added to the result string. However, this approach does not remove lowercase substrings; it removes all lowercase characters.

A correct implementation would involve checking for sequences of lowercase characters and skipping over them, but the provided program does not handle this case. For example, if the input string is "HeLlO", the program will return "HO", which is correct. However, if the input string is "Hello World", the program will return "HW", which is not the expected result of removing lowercase substrings.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input string is "abABcd". The program will return "AB", but the expected result of removing lowercase substrings should be "AB" because "ab" and "cd" are both lowercase substrings that should be removed. The program does not handle this case correctly because it only checks each character individually, rather than checking for sequences of characters. 

The program would need to be modified to check for sequences of lowercase characters and remove them, rather than just checking each character individually.
