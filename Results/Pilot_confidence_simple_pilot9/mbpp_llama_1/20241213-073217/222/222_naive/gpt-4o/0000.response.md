Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem asks for removing lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided program simply removes all lowercase characters from the string.

For example, if the input string is 'aBCd', the program will return 'BC', which is correct because 'a' and 'd' are lowercase characters. However, if the input string is 'abCD', the program will return 'CD', but it should have returned 'CD' as well because 'ab' is a lowercase substring and 'CD' is not. However the issue arises when you test with 'ABcd', here the output should be 'AB' but if you have 'ABCde' the output 'AB' would be still correct because 'Cde' is a substring that contains all lower case letters.

A case can be made with the string 'abABcd' the description would say it should return 'AB' whereas this function would return 'AB', actually this example still passes but when 'abcdABC' the answer 'ABC' which still follows the rule. 

Another example is 'aBcd' which should return 'B', but function also returns 'B'. In general, it seems the description of removing all lowercase characters is not exactly in line with the definition of removing lowercase substrings.

However, after further analysis of multiple test cases, an example where the function does not behave as expected according to a likely interpretation of the problem description is not easy to construct given the simple definition of the test cases given, because every test seems to remove all lowercase letters.

However the key insight is that all the test cases provided remove all the lowercase characters in the string. So it feels like the function provided is removing lowercase characters and not lowercase substrings, the two are not equivalent. Therefore even though we can't find an obvious counter example that contradicts the test cases provided the function still doesn't follow the problem description of removing lowercase substrings.

Note that the unit tests provided seem to also be checking for removal of lowercase characters, not substrings. The function provided does pass these unit tests, but does not necessarily meet the problem description. Therefore, based on the problem description alone, the function is not correct. 

However, for completeness, here's a simple example of what removing a substring would look like in python.
```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    s_new = ''
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i].islower():
            j = i
            while j < len(s) and s[j].islower():
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            s_new += s[i]
            i += 1
    return s_new
```
