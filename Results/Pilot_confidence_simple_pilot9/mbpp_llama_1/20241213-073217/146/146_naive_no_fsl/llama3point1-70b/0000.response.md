Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem statement asks for the list of maximum length in a list of lists, but the provided code returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist that has this maximum length.

A case where the program does not work as expected is when there are multiple sublists of the same maximum length. For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`, the function should return all sublists of length 3, which are `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`. However, the given program will only return the first sublist of maximum length, which is `([3, [1, 2, 3]])`.

To fix this, the function should return all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_sublists
```

This version of the function will return all sublists that have the maximum length, as required by the problem description.
