Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it iterates through each sublist in the list of lists, checks the length of the current sublist, and updates `max_len` and `max_list` if the current sublist is longer than the previous longest sublist found. This approach ensures that it will find the longest sublist(s) in the list of lists.

However, it's worth noting that if there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, this function will only return one of them (the last one it encounters). If the problem description requires returning all sublists with the maximum length, the function would need to be modified to store all such sublists. But based on the provided unit tests, it seems that returning one of the longest sublists is sufficient. 

Here's a slight modification to handle the case where there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_lists = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_lists = [lst]
        elif len(lst) == max_len:
            max_lists.append(lst)
    return (max_len, max_lists)

```

But again, based on the provided unit tests, the original function seems to be correct.
