Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. One potential case where the program does not work as expected is when the input `n` is a power of 2. For example, if `n = 32` and `k = 2`, the program will output "Yes" followed by "5 5", which is not the lexicographically largest sequence that minimizes the maximum value. A correct output should be "No" because there is no sequence of length 2 that adds up to 32 with powers of 2.

Another issue with the program is that it does not consider the case when `n` can be represented as a sum of smaller powers of 2. For example, if `n = 11` and `k = 4`, the program will output "No", but the correct output should be "Yes" followed by "-1 -1 -1 -1" because 11 can be represented as a sum of four powers of 2 with negative exponents.

The program also does not handle the case when `n` is less than `k` correctly. According to the problem description, the program should output "No" in this case, but the current implementation only checks if `n` is less than `k` and does not consider the fact that the sum of the powers of 2 should be equal to `n`.

Overall, the program does not correctly handle all the possible cases described in the problem, and therefore its correctness is False.
