Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it constructs the sequence of powers of 2 that sum up to `n`. The current implementation simply takes the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`, subtracts it from `n`, and repeats this process until `n` becomes 0 or the number of terms reaches `k`. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will have the minimum maximum value (i.e., the smallest `y` value).

A counterexample is when `n = 10` and `k = 3`. The program will output `No`, but the correct output should be `Yes` with the sequence `2 1 0` (since 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7, but 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 2 + 1 = 11 > 10, so the correct sequence is not achievable with the maximum value 2; however, the sequence 3 1 -1 (2^3 + 2^1 + 2^-1 = 8 + 2 + 0.5 = 10.5) is also not correct but the sequence 2 1 -1  (2^2 + 2^1 + 2^-1 = 4 + 2 + 0.5 = 6.5)  and the sequence 1 1 1 (2^1 + 2^1 + 2^1 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6) and the sequence 2 1 0 (2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7) shows that with three 2s it is impossible to reach 10).

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or recursion to explore all possible sequences of powers of 2 that sum up to `n`. Unfortunately, the provided program does not implement such an approach. 

Another issue with this code is when `n` equals `k`. In such cases, the code should return `Yes` with `k` zeros (since 2^0 + 2^0 +... + 2^0 = 1 + 1 +... + 1 = k), but it currently returns `No`. 

One more issue with the provided solution is that the code does not handle cases where `n` can be represented as a sum of `k` distinct powers of 2 but some of these powers are negative. For instance, when `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the code should return `Yes` with `-1 -1` (since 2^-1 + 2^-1 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1), but it currently returns `No`. 

In conclusion, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to its simplistic approach and failure to handle edge cases. A more comprehensive solution is needed to address these issues.
