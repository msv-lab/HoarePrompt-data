Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers and then determines which skewers should be turned over at each step.

The formula used to calculate the minimum number of actions `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` seems correct, as it takes into account the number of skewers that can be turned over with each action.

The loop `for i in range(l): res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` also appears to be correct, as it calculates the position of the skewer that should be turned over at each step. The position is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which ensures that the skewers are turned over in a way that covers the entire range of skewers.

The program does not seem to have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly. For example, if `n` is less than or equal to `k * 2 + 1`, the program will correctly calculate that only one action is needed. If `k` is 0, the program will correctly calculate that each skewer needs to be turned over individually.

Overall, the program seems to be a correct implementation of the problem description, and I was unable to find any cases where it does not work as expected.
