_correctness: **True**_

_The provided program seems to correctly solve the problem of turning over all skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. It calculates the minimum number of actions needed by dividing the total number of skewers by the range of skewers that can be turned over in one step (k * 2 + 1). Then it prints out the numbers of the skewers that should be turned over at each step._

_The program appears to work correctly for all cases, including edge cases such as when n is less than or equal to k * 2 + 1, or when k is 0. The formula used to calculate the minimum number of actions (l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)) ensures that the program can handle these cases correctly._

_Furthermore, the program's approach of always turning over the skewers that are at the start of each group of k * 2 + 1 skewers ensures that the minimum number of actions is used. This is because turning over any other skewer would require additional actions to turn over the remaining skewers in the group._

_I could not find any case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct._
