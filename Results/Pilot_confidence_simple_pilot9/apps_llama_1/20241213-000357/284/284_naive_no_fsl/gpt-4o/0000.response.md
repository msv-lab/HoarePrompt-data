Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the placement of the function definition `func_1(x)`. In Python, the function needs to be defined before it is used. However, in the given code, the function `func_1(x)` is defined after it is used in the for loop.

When the code is run, it will throw a `NameError` because `func_1` is not defined when it is called. To fix this, the function definition should be moved to the top of the code, before the for loop.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break
```
