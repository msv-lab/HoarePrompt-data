Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly checks all the conditions required for a fair game. Here are the key points that make the program correct:

1. **Handling the case when there is only one unique number**: If there is only one unique number, the game cannot be fair because Petya and Vasya must choose different numbers. The program correctly handles this case by printing "NO" when the number of unique numbers is less than 2.

2. **Checking if the two most frequent numbers can lead to a fair game**: The program correctly checks if the two most frequent numbers can lead to a fair game by comparing their counts to `n // 2`. If both numbers have a count equal to `n // 2`, the game can be fair, and the program prints "YES" along with the two numbers.

3. **Handling the case when no two numbers can lead to a fair game**: If no two numbers have a count equal to `n // 2`, the game cannot be fair, and the program correctly prints "NO".

The program also correctly handles the case when there are more than two unique numbers, because it checks the counts of the two most frequent numbers, which are the only ones that could potentially lead to a fair game.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For instance, in the first example, the program correctly prints "YES" and the numbers 11 and 27, because these numbers can lead to a fair game. In the second example, the program correctly prints "NO" because there is only one unique number. In the third example, the program correctly prints "NO" because no two numbers have a count equal to `n // 2`.
