Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One example where the program fails is when the input string has a length greater than 2 and all its substrings of length 1 and 2 are not palindromes, but the longest non-palindrome substring is not the entire string or the string without the first or last character.

For instance, consider the input "abbaab". The longest non-palindrome substring of this string is "abbaab" itself and its substrings "bbaab". However, the function func_1(s) checks if the entire string is a palindrome or not. It does not consider all possible substrings of the string.

The correct approach would be to generate all possible substrings of the input string and check if they are palindromes or not. If a non-palindrome substring is found, its length should be compared with the maximum length found so far.

Here's an example of how the correct code could look:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def longest_non_palindrome(s):
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if not is_palindrome(substr):
                max_length = max(max_length, len(substr))
    return max_length

s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
else:
    print(longest_non_palindrome(s))
```
This version of the code correctly handles all cases by checking all substrings of the input string and returns the length of the longest non-palindrome substring. If all substrings are palindromes, it prints 0.
