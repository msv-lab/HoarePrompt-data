Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. The main issue is that the program only checks if the entire string is a palindrome or if the string without the first or last character is a palindrome. However, it does not check all possible substrings of the string to find the longest one that is not a palindrome.

A counterexample is the string "abba". The longest non-palindrome substring of this string is "ab" or "bb", but the program would incorrectly output 0 because it only checks the entire string and the string without the first or last character.

To correctly solve this problem, the program would need to check all possible substrings of the string, not just the entire string and the string without the first or last character. 

Here is a simple example of how this could be done:

```python
def longest_non_palindrome(s):
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substring = s[i:j]
            if substring!= substring[::-1]:
                max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))
    return max_length

s = input().strip()
print(longest_non_palindrome(s))
```
This code works by checking all possible substrings of the string. If a substring is not equal to its reverse, it is not a palindrome and its length is compared to the current maximum length. If it is longer, the maximum length is updated. If no non-palindrome substrings are found, the function returns 0.
