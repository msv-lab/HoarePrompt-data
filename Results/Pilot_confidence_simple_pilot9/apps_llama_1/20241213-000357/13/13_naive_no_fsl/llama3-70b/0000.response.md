Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the optimal swap involves two 'S' characters correctly. The current implementation only checks for the case where a 'G' character is swapped with an 'S' character. However, the optimal swap might involve swapping two 'S' characters to create a longer subsegment of 'G' characters.

For example, if the input is "GGSSGGGG", the optimal swap would be to swap the two 'S' characters, resulting in the string "GGGGGGSS", which has a subsegment of 6 'G' characters. However, the current implementation would not find this optimal swap.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to check all possible swaps, not just swaps involving a 'G' character and an 'S' character. This can be done by iterating over all pairs of characters and checking the resulting string after swapping them. 

Here's a possible way to modify the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_beauty = 0

    # check all possible swaps
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            swapped_s = list(s)
            swapped_s[i], swapped_s[j] = swapped_s[j], swapped_s[i]
            beauty = 0
            max_beauty_in_swapped_s = 0
            for char in swapped_s:
                if char == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                    max_beauty_in_swapped_s = max(max_beauty_in_swapped_s, beauty)
                else:
                    beauty = 0
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, max_beauty_in_swapped_s)

    # check the case where no swap is made
    beauty = 0
    max_beauty_in_s = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == 'G':
            beauty += 1
            max_beauty_in_s = max(max_beauty_in_s, beauty)
        else:
            beauty = 0
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, max_beauty_in_s)

    print(max_beauty)
```
