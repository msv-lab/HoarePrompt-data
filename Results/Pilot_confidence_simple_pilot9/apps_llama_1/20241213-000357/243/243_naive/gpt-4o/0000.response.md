Correctness: **True**.

I believe the program is correct because it accurately implements the algorithm to find the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. 

The program uses a binary search approach to find the numbers n that satisfy the condition. It first calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given number using the `func_1` function, which is based on the mathematical property that the number of trailing zeroes in n! is equal to the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.

The `func_2` function uses a binary search approach to find the range of numbers n that satisfy the condition. It starts with a range of possible values and iteratively refines the range until it finds the exact range of numbers that have exactly m trailing zeroes in their factorial.

The program then generates the list of numbers n that satisfy the condition and returns it. 

I have reviewed the code and it seems to handle all the edge cases correctly. The code also generates the correct output for the example inputs provided in the problem description. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The code seems to be correct and should work for all possible inputs. 

One of the key points of this solution is the use of a binary search, which reduces the time complexity of the solution. The use of `func_1` to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in n! is also efficient, as it only requires a constant number of operations. 

Overall, I believe that the program is correct and should work for all possible inputs.
