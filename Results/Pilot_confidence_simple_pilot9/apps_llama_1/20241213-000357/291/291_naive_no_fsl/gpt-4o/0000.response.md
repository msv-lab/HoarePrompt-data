Correctness: **False** 

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments that Sofia needs to draw with a ruler. 

The issue lies in the calculation of the number of segments needed. The program calculates it as 2 * (a + b), where a is the number of rows and b is the number of columns. However, this is incorrect because when drawing squares, the shared sides between adjacent squares can be drawn with a guide, and thus we don't need to draw all the sides of each square.

For example, when drawing a single row of squares, we need to draw the top and bottom sides of the row, and the vertical sides of the first and last squares. For each additional square in the row, we only need to draw one more vertical side. 

So, if Sofia wants to draw n squares, the minimum number of segments she needs to draw is the perimeter of the rectangle that can be formed with n squares (2 * sqrt(n)), not 2 * (a + b).

A correct approach to solve this problem is to find the factors of n and calculate the perimeter of the rectangle for each factor pair, then return the minimum perimeter found.

Here is the correct Python program:
```python
import math

def min_segments(n):
    min_segments_needed = float('inf')
    for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % a == 0:
            b = n // a
            segments_needed = 2 * (a + b - 2) + 4 if a == 1 or b == 1 else 2 * (a + b - 2)
            min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
    return min_segments_needed

n = int(input().strip())
print(min_segments(n))
```
