Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases because it calculates the minimum number of segments needed to draw `n` squares by iterating over all possible arrangements of rows and columns, but it does not account for the fact that the number of rows and columns should be as close as possible to minimize the number of segments.

However, a more straightforward approach to find the minimum number of segments would be to arrange the squares in a way that minimizes the perimeter of the resulting shape, which can be done by making the number of rows and columns as close to each other as possible.

For example, if `n = 6`, the program will return `10`, but the correct answer should be `8`. This is because the program is considering arrangements like 1x6, 2x3, etc., but not the fact that a 2x3 arrangement will require fewer segments than a 1x6 arrangement.

A correct solution would be to find the closest factors of `n` and use those as the number of rows and columns, which would result in the minimum number of segments needed. 

Here is an example of the correct solution:
```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())

def func_1(n):
    rows = int(math.sqrt(n))
    cols = (n + rows - 1) // rows
    while rows * cols > n:
        rows -= 1
        cols = (n + rows - 1) // rows
    return 2 * (rows + cols) - 2 * math.gcd(rows, cols)

print(func_1(n))
```
This solution will correctly calculate the minimum number of segments needed to draw `n` squares in the manner described in the problem.
