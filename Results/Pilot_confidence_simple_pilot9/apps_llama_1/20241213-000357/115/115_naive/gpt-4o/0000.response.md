Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the operations to make matrix B equal to matrix A. The issue with the program is that it only checks for submatrices of size 2x2 in matrix A where all elements are 1, and then performs the operation on matrix B. However, this approach is not sufficient to make matrix B equal to matrix A.

A case where the program fails is when matrix A has a single 1 in a 2x2 submatrix. For example, if matrix A is:

```
1 0
0 0
```

The program will not perform any operations, but the correct output should be to set the top-left 2x2 submatrix of matrix B to 1, which is not possible since matrix B only has two rows and columns.

Another case where the program fails is when matrix A has a configuration where a single operation can set multiple 1s in matrix B. For example, if matrix A is:

```
1 1
1 1
```

The program will perform two operations, but the correct output should be to perform only one operation to set the entire 2x2 submatrix of matrix B to 1.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to be modified to check for all possible 2x2 submatrices in matrix A and perform the operations accordingly. Additionally, the program needs to handle edge cases where the 2x2 submatrix is not fully contained in matrix A. 

The given code does not cover all possible cases, which results in incorrect output for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.
