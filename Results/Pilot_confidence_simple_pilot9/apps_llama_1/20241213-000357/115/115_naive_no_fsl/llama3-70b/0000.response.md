Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program is attempting to solve the problem by checking each submatrix of size 2x2 in matrix A. However, the logic used in the program is incorrect.

The issue lies in the fact that the program only performs an operation (i.e., sets the corresponding submatrix in B to 1) when at least one of the elements in the submatrix of A is 1, but not all of them are 1. This approach is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the resulting matrix B will be equal to matrix A.

A counterexample to the program's correctness can be seen in the following input:

```
4 4
1 1 0 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1
0 0 1 1
```

In this case, the program will perform operations on the submatrices that contain at least one 1, but it will not ensure that the resulting matrix B is equal to matrix A. Specifically, the program will not correctly handle the case where a submatrix in A contains all 1s, and then an adjacent submatrix is operated on, potentially overwriting the previously set 1s.

Furthermore, the program does not properly handle the case where a 1 in matrix A is part of two different 2x2 submatrices that need to be operated on separately, as it only checks for the presence of 1s in the current submatrix, not considering the effects of previous operations on adjacent submatrices.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a backtracking algorithm or a recursive function to explore all possible operations and find a sequence that transforms matrix B into matrix A.
