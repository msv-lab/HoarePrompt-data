Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not accurately solve the problem. The problem asks to determine if it's possible to switch on three garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit. 

However, the program checks if the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals is divisible by each interval, which is not the correct condition to solve the problem.

One potential issue is that the program only checks if the LCM is divisible by each interval, but it doesn't consider the actual lit periods of the garlands. For example, consider the input `2 4 6`. The program will calculate the LCM as `24` and check if it's divisible by `2`, `4`, and `6`, which it is. However, if we switch on the garlands at seconds `1`, `2`, and `3`, we can see that there will be some seconds when no garland is lit.

Another issue is that the program doesn't consider the case when the intervals are not coprime. For example, consider the input `2 2 2`. The program will calculate the LCM as `2`, but it's not possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check all possible combinations of switching on the garlands and verify if there's at least one combination that satisfies the condition. The correct approach would involve checking all possible values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` and verifying if there's a combination that covers all seconds after the maximum of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`. 

Here's a simple counter-example for the given program: if we input `6 3 2`, the program will output `YES`, but it's actually not possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit.
