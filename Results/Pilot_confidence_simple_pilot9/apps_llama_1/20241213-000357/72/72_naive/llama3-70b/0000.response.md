Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to correctly implement the required logic. It calculates the maximum number of questions asked to a pupil, the minimum number of questions asked to a pupil, and the number of times Sergei is asked.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

- `max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`: This line calculates the maximum number of questions asked to a pupil. The `(n - 1)` is added to `k` to account for the case where `k` is not exactly divisible by `2 * n`. This ensures that pupils on the edge rows are considered.

- `min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`: This line calculates the minimum number of questions asked to a pupil. If `max_asked` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, then `min_asked` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to `max_asked - (n - 1)`. This accounts for the pupils who may not be asked as many times due to the cyclic nature of the questioning.

- `sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`: This line calculates the number of times Sergei is asked. The logic here is a bit more complex. The first part `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n)` calculates the number of complete cycles Sergei is asked in. The second part `((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)` checks if Sergei is asked in the incomplete cycle. If he is, then this expression evaluates to 1, and 0 otherwise. This ensures that Sergei's questions are accurately counted.

After examining the given examples, the program appears to produce the expected output for each case. Additionally, the logic seems sound for the general case, taking into account the cyclic nature of the questioning and the edge cases for Sergei's row and position. If a counterexample cannot be found, and the program produces correct results for all test cases, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.
