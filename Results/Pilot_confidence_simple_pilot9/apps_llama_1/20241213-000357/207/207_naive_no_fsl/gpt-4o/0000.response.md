Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the sum of the number of distinct integers a frog can reach within a given interval [0, m]. The program takes into account the constraints that the frog can only jump to positions k+a or k-b from a position k.

The program correctly handles two main cases: 

1. When the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b is 1, it uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of the number of distinct integers the frog can reach.

2. When the gcd of a and b is not 1, it reduces the problem to a simpler case by dividing a, b, and m by the gcd.

The program's logic and calculations are correct and consistent with the problem description. All provided examples are correctly solved by the program.

The key insight in the program is the use of the gcd of a and b to simplify the problem. If the gcd of a and b is 1, the frog can reach all integers within the interval [0, m]. If the gcd is not 1, the frog can only reach integers that are multiples of the gcd.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it passes all provided test cases. Without additional counterexamples or incorrect outputs, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
