Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly determines whether a given directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. 

The `func_1` function constructs the graph from the given edges and first checks if the graph is acyclic using the `has_cycle` function. If it is, the function returns 'YES'. 

If the graph contains a cycle, the function then tries removing each edge one by one and checks if the resulting graph is acyclic. If removing any edge makes the graph acyclic, the function returns 'YES'. 

If removing any single edge does not make the graph acyclic, the function returns 'NO', indicating that the graph cannot be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. 

The `has_cycle` function uses the topological sorting algorithm to check for cycles in the graph. It first calculates the in-degree of each node and then uses a queue to process nodes with an in-degree of 0. If the count of processed nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph, it indicates that the graph contains a cycle.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including graphs with and without cycles, and graphs that can or cannot be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. 

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
