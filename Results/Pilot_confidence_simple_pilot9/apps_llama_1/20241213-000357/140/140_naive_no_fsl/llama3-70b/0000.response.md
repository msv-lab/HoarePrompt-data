Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it doesn't properly check if removing at most one edge can make the graph acyclic. The current implementation only checks if the graph is acyclic, but it doesn't try to remove edges to make it acyclic.

A correct implementation would involve checking for cycles and then trying to remove each edge to see if the graph becomes acyclic. The current implementation doesn't handle this case.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```
The program will print 'NO', but it should print 'YES' because removing the edge 3 -> 1 makes the graph acyclic.

To fix this, we need to modify the program to check all possible edges and see if removing any of them makes the graph acyclic. Here's an example of how we can modify the function to achieve this:

```python
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
edges = []
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)
    edges.append((u, v))

def has_cycle(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if has_cycle(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False

def is_acyclic(graph):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    rec_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
    for node in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[node]:
            if has_cycle(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return False
    return True

removed_edge = False
for (u, v) in edges:
    temp_graph = [row[:] for row in graph]
    temp_graph[u] = [x for x in temp_graph[u] if x!= v]
    if is_acyclic(temp_graph):
        print('YES')
        removed_edge = True
        break

if not removed_edge:
    print('NO')
```
