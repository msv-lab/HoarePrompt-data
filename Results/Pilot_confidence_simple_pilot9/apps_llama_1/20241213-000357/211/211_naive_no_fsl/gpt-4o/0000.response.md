Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. One potential case where the program fails is when the input array has more than two non-zero elements with different sign sums. 

For example, for the input:
```
5
1 2 -3 4 -4
```
The program will output:
```
YES
1
1 5
```
However, this output does not satisfy the condition that the sum of elements in each new array is non-zero, as the sum of the entire array is zero. 

A correct solution would need to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums, which the given program does not do correctly in all cases. 

In the provided code, there is no attempt to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums when the total sum of the array is non-zero but there are multiple elements with different sign sums. The program only checks if the total sum is zero, and if not, it simply outputs the entire array as one subarray, which does not satisfy the problem's conditions. 

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
