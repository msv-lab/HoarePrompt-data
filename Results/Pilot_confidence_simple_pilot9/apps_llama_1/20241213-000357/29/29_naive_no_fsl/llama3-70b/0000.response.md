Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly in every potential case. For example, consider the case where the input is:

```
5
01 0
2 1
2extra 0
3 1
99 0
```

The program will output:

```
5
move 3 1
move 2 2
move 99 3
move 2extra 4
move 01 5
```

However, this output is incorrect because the file "2" is moved to "2" which doesn't change its name, and the file "2extra" is moved to "4" but the file "2" should be moved to "1" first and then "2" to "2" or "3" to "2" and the rest accordingly. 

The problem in the code is that it does not handle the case where a file is moved to a name that is already occupied by another file. The code simply appends the move commands to the script without considering the current state of the file system.

A correct approach would be to first sort the files by type and then by name, and then iterate through the files, assigning the correct name to each file and handling any name conflicts that may arise.

Here is an example of how the correct output should look like for the given input:

```
4
move 3 1
move 01 5
move 2extra 4
move 99 3
```
