Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the maximum number of fishes that can be caught by the scoop-net, but it does not consider the actual expected value of the number of caught fishes when the scoop-net is placed randomly.

The program assumes that the expected value is always the minimum of `k` and `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, which is incorrect. The expected value should be calculated based on the number of possible positions of the scoop-net and the number of fishes caught in each position.

A correct solution would involve distributing the `k` fishes in the pond in a way that maximizes the expected number of caught fishes. This can be achieved by placing the fishes in a grid that covers the entire pond, ensuring that each fish is caught by the scoop-net in a maximum number of positions.

For example, when `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, and `k = 3`, the program outputs `2.0`, but the correct output is `2.0`, which is correct, however, for other inputs, the program may not work correctly.

A counterexample can be found when `n = 4`, `m = 4`, `r = 2`, and `k = 4`. The program outputs `4 / 9 = 0.4444444444`, but the correct output should be higher because we can place all 4 fishes in a grid that covers the entire pond, ensuring that each fish is caught by the scoop-net in a maximum number of positions.

The correct approach would be to calculate the expected value of the number of caught fishes based on the number of possible positions of the scoop-net and the number of fishes caught in each position. This requires a more complex algorithm that takes into account the distribution of fishes in the pond and the size of the scoop-net. 

The given code doesn't take these factors into consideration and therefore doesn't always produce the correct expected value.
