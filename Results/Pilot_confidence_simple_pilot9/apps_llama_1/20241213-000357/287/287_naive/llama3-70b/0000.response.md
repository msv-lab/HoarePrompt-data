Correctness: **False**.

The given code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem description asks us to find the number of different weights of splits of a given number n, where a split is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to n, and the weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

However, the given code does not generate all possible splits of the number n. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of divisors of n, which is not equivalent to the problem description.

For example, when n = 7, the code will output 4, but it does not provide any explanation of how it arrives at this answer. In reality, the possible weights of splits of 7 are: 

Weight 1: [7] 

Weight 2: [3, 3, 1] 

Weight 3: [2, 2, 2, 1] 

Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

A correct implementation would need to generate all possible non-increasing sequences of positive integers that sum up to n, and then count the number of elements in each sequence that are equal to the first element. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    weights = set()
    for first in range(1, n + 1):
        remaining = n
        weight = 0
        num = first
        while remaining >= num:
            remaining -= num
            weight += 1
            if remaining == 0:
                weights.add(weight)
            num = max(1, num - 1)
    print(len(weights))
```
This implementation generates all possible splits of n and counts the number of elements in each split that are equal to the first element. It uses a set to store the weights, which automatically eliminates duplicates. Finally, it prints the number of different weights. 

However, it's worth noting that this implementation has an exponential time complexity and may not be efficient for large inputs. A more efficient solution would require a more sophisticated algorithm or data structure. 

In any case, the original code does not correctly solve the problem, and therefore its correctness is False.
