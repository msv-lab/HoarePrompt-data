Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. The provided function `func_1` seems to be counting the number of divisors of `n`, which is not the same as counting the different weights of splits.

For example, if we input `n = 4`, the correct output should be `3` because there are three possible weights of splits: `1` (`[4]`), `2` (`[2, 2]`), and `4` (`[1, 1, 1, 1]`). However, the program outputs `3` which happens to be correct but for the wrong reasons.

To demonstrate the incorrectness, let's consider `n = 6`. The correct output should be `4` because there are four possible weights of splits: `1` (`[6]`), `2` (`[3, 3]`), `2` (`[2, 2, 2]`), and `6` (`[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`). However, the program outputs `4` which happens to be correct but again for the wrong reasons.

However, if we input `n = 11`, the program will output `2` because it only counts the number of divisors of `11` which are `1` and `11`. But the correct output should be `5` because there are five possible weights of splits: `1` (`[11]`), `2` (`[5, 5, 1]`), `3` (`[3, 3, 3, 2]`), `5` (`[2, 2, 2, 2, 3]`), and `11` (`[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`).

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case.
