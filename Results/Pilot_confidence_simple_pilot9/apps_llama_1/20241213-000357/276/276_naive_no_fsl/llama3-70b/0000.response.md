Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the comparison of two numbers in the golden system. The program defines a function `func_1` that converts a golden system number to its decimal equivalent using the formula provided in the problem description. It then compares the decimal values of the two input numbers and prints the result accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal value of a golden system number by iterating over each digit in the reversed string, multiplying the digit by `q` raised to the power of its position, and summing up the results.

2. The program correctly handles the comparison of the decimal values of the two input numbers and prints the result as specified in the problem description.

The program is well-structured and handles all potential cases correctly. It does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases, and there is no example where the program does not work as expected.
