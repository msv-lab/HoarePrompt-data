Correctness: **True**.

The given program is designed to compare two numbers written in the golden system notation and determine which one has a larger decimal value. It first reads two inputs, converts each of them into a decimal value using the function `func_1`, and then compares these decimal values to print the result.

The conversion function `func_1` uses the formula for calculating the decimal value of a number in the golden system, which is $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$. Here, $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, and $a_i$ are the digits of the number in the golden system.

The program correctly implements this formula by iterating over the digits of the input string from right to left (using `enumerate(reversed(s))`), calculating the decimal value of each digit based on its position and the value of $q$, and summing these values to get the total decimal value of the number.

The comparison of the decimal values of the two input numbers is also correct, as it checks whether the decimal value of the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the decimal value of the second number, and prints the corresponding result.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The examples provided also work correctly with the given code. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
