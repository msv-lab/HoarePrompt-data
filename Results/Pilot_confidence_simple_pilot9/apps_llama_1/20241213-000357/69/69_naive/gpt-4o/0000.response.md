Correctness: **False**.

The provided code attempts to find the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed in the sequence of operations to move the robot from (0, 0) to (x, y). However, it has a bug in the logic of calculating the minimum length of the subsegment.

The issue lies in the fact that the code only checks if the target position is in the position_map, which is not sufficient. It should also consider the case where the target position is not in the position_map, but can be reached by changing the operations.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
RURUU
-2 3
```

The code will not correctly calculate the minimum length of the subsegment in this case.

To fix the code, we need to change the approach to find the minimum length of the subsegment. One way to do this is to use a sliding window approach, where we maintain two pointers, `start` and `end`, to represent the current subsegment. We then iterate over the operations and update the `start` and `end` pointers to find the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed.

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look like:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    for start in range(n):
        current_x = 0
        current_y = 0
        for i in range(start):
            if operations[i] == 'U':
                current_y += 1
            elif operations[i] == 'D':
                current_y -= 1
            elif operations[i] == 'L':
                current_x -= 1
            elif operations[i] == 'R':
                current_x += 1
        for end in range(start, n):
            if operations[end] == 'U':
                current_y += 1
            elif operations[end] == 'D':
                current_y -= 1
            elif operations[end] == 'L':
                current_x -= 1
            elif operations[end] == 'R':
                current_x += 1
            if current_x == x and current_y == y:
                min_length = min(min_length, end - start + 1)
    return min_length if min_length!= float('inf') else -1
```

This code iterates over all possible subsegments of the operations and checks if the current subsegment can be modified to move the robot to (x, y). If it can, it updates the minimum length of the subsegment. If no such subsegment is found, it returns -1.

Note that this is just one possible way to correct the code, and there may be other approaches as well.
