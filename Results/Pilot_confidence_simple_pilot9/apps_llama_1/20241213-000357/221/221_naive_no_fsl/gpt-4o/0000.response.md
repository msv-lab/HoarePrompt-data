Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. The problem asks for the number of possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b are positive integers, a + b = s, and a ^ b = x. The program provided does not attempt to solve this problem. It only defines two equations involving a and b, but does not calculate the sum or XOR of a and b, nor does it count the number of possible pairs.

For example, if we call `func()` with s = 9 and x = 5, the program will not return 4, which is the correct answer according to the problem description. Instead, it will not return anything because the function does not have a return statement.

A correct program would need to iterate over all possible pairs of positive integers (a, b) where a + b = s and a ^ b = x, and count the number of such pairs.

Here is a simple Python program that solves the problem correctly:
```python
def count_pairs(s, x):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    return count

s, x = map(int, input().split())
print(count_pairs(s, x))
```
