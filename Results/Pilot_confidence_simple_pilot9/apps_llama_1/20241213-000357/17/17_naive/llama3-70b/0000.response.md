Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings. 

The program checks if `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1` and if so, it prints 0, indicating that it is not possible to form a regular bracket sequence. However, this condition is not sufficient to determine the possibility of forming a regular bracket sequence.

A correct condition would be to check if the total number of opening brackets (2*cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3) is equal to the total number of closing brackets (2*cnt4 + cnt2 + cnt3), because this ensures that the sequence can be made regular.

However, the provided program doesn't consider this. For example, consider the case when cnt1 = 1, cnt2 = 1, cnt3 = 0, and cnt4 = 1. The program would print 1, indicating that it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence, but the correct output should be 0, because the total number of opening brackets (2*1 + 1 + 0 = 3) is not equal to the total number of closing brackets (2*1 + 1 + 0 = 3), but actually in this case, we can construct a regular bracket sequence: "(()())".

Another case is cnt1 = 2, cnt2 = 0, cnt3 = 1, cnt4 = 2. In this case, the program would also print 1, indicating that it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence, but it is actually impossible, because no matter how we order these strings, we will never get a regular bracket sequence.

The correct approach is to check the total balance of opening and closing brackets in the sequence, not just the relation between cnt1 and cnt3.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if 2*cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3 == 2*cnt4 + cnt2 + cnt3 and cnt3 <= cnt2 + cnt1:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)
```
