Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. It takes the initial weights of Limak and Bob as input, triples Limak's weight, and doubles Bob's weight in each iteration until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. It takes the initial weights of Limak (`a`) and Bob (`b`) as input.
2. It initializes a variable `years` to 0, which keeps track of the number of years that have passed.
3. It enters a while loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).
4. Inside the loop, it triples Limak's weight (`a *= 3`) and doubles Bob's weight (`b *= 2`), simulating the weight changes after each year.
5. It increments the `years` variable by 1 in each iteration, effectively tracking the number of years that have passed.
6. Once Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight (i.e., `a > b`), the loop terminates, and the program prints the number of years (`years`) that have passed.

This program works correctly for all possible input scenarios because it accurately simulates the weight changes after each year and stops when Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The provided examples in the problem description also demonstrate the program's correctness.

For instance, considering the example input `4 7`:

* Year 1: Limak's weight becomes `4 * 3 = 12`, and Bob's weight becomes `7 * 2 = 14`. Limak is still not heavier, so the loop continues.
* Year 2: Limak's weight becomes `12 * 3 = 36`, and Bob's weight becomes `14 * 2 = 28`. Limak is now heavier, so the loop terminates, and the program prints `2`, which is correct.

Similarly, for the example input `4 9`:

* Year 1: Limak's weight becomes `4 * 3 = 12`, and Bob's weight becomes `9 * 2 = 18`. Limak is still not heavier, so the loop continues.
* Year 2: Limak's weight becomes `12 * 3 = 36`, and Bob's weight becomes `18 * 2 = 36`. Limak is still not heavier (they are equal), so the loop continues.
* Year 3: Limak's weight becomes `36 * 3 = 108`, and Bob's weight becomes `36 * 2 = 72`. Limak is now heavier, so the loop terminates, and the program prints `3`, which is correct.

Given that the program accurately implements the problem logic and produces correct results for various input scenarios, it is indeed correct.
