Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description. The task is to calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$, where in one operation, a contiguous substring of equal letters can be deleted.

The program works by iterating over the input string $s$ and incrementing the answer $ans$ whenever it encounters a letter that is different from the previous one. This is because if two consecutive letters are different, they cannot be deleted in the same operation, so an additional operation is needed.

The initial value of $ans$ is set to 1, which corresponds to the case where the entire string consists of the same letter. In this case, only one operation is needed to delete the whole string.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided. For instance, in the example "abaca", the program outputs 3, which is correct because we need to delete "a" (1 operation), "b" (1 operation), "a" (1 operation), and "c" and "a" (1 operation) can be combined into one deletion operation of "ca", but since "b" is in between "a" and "ca", we need 3 operations.

Similarly, in the example "abcddcba", the program outputs 4, which is correct because we need to delete "a" (1 operation), "b" (1 operation), "c" (1 operation), and "dd" and "cb" and "a" can be combined into one deletion operation but "d" can be combined into one deletion of "dd", so 4 operations are needed.

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
