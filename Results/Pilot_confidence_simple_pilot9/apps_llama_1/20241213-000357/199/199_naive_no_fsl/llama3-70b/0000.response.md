Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct, and it follows the problem description accurately. It counts the number of ways to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

The code defines a function `func_1` that takes the length `n` of the stick as input. It iterates over all possible values of `a` and `b` such that `1 <= a <= n/2` and `a <= b <= (n-a)/2`. If `a` is not equal to `b` and the sum of the lengths of the four parts `2*(a+b)` equals `n`, it increments the count of ways.

This logic ensures that the sticks can be arranged to form a rectangle (since two pairs of sticks have the same length `a` and `b`), but not a square (since `a` and `b` are not equal).

The provided examples in the problem description match the output of the program, and no counterexample could be found where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is considered correct. 

However, the function `func_1(n)` should be called after its definition in the given program for it to run correctly. The correct version should look like this:
```python
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a!= b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways

n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))
```
