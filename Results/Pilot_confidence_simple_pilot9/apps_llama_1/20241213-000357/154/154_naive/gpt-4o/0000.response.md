Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum points that Polycarp can earn. The issue lies in the way it calculates the subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time after completing some tasks.

The program currently calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time by dividing the remaining time by the time required for each subtask and summing them up. However, this approach does not consider the fact that each task can have at most k subtasks, and the program should prioritize solving subtasks from the tasks that have not been completed yet.

A correct approach would be to sort the subtasks by their time requirements and then try to solve them one by one until the remaining time is used up. The program should also keep track of the number of subtasks solved for each task and ensure that it does not exceed k for any task.

Here's an example where the program fails:

Input:
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

The program will calculate the total time per task as 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31, which exceeds the available time of 10. Therefore, it will not consider any complete tasks and will try to solve subtasks with the remaining time.

However, the program will calculate the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved as 10 // 1 = 10, which exceeds the total number of subtasks available (5 tasks * 5 subtasks = 25). Then, it will limit the number of subtasks to 25, which is still incorrect because it does not consider the fact that each task can have at most 5 subtasks.

A correct solution would be to solve the first subtask of all 5 tasks, which takes 5 minutes, and then solve the second subtask of 2 tasks, which takes 4 minutes, resulting in a total of 9 points (5 + 2 + 2). The remaining 1 minute is not enough to solve any other subtask. 

Therefore, the given program does not correctly calculate the maximum points that Polycarp can earn in all cases.
