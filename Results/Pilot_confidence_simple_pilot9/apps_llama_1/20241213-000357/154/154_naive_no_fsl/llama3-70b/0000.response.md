Correctness: **False**

The given program is not entirely correct based on the problem description. The main issue lies in the way it attempts to solve the problem but does not fully address the problem's requirements. 

The problem requires finding the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit, considering that he can solve subtasks in any order and earns points for each subtask completed, with an additional point for completely solving a task. 

However, the provided Python code seems to attempt a dynamic programming solution but does not correctly implement the logic to maximize points earned within the time limit, especially considering the option to partially solve tasks and earn points for each subtask.

The code does not correctly account for the scenario where Polycarp can start solving a task but might not complete it within the time limit, thus potentially earning points for the subtasks he has completed. 

An example to illustrate the potential issue:
- Suppose we have 2 tasks (n=2), each with 3 subtasks (k=3), and the time limit is 10 minutes (M=10).
- The times to solve the subtasks are 1, 2, and 5 minutes, respectively.
- A correct approach should consider all possible combinations of solving subtasks across tasks to maximize the points within the time limit.

Given the constraints and the problem's requirements, the code provided does not fully address the problem, missing the critical aspect of dynamically choosing which subtasks to solve across multiple tasks to maximize points. 

Therefore, the Correctness is **False**. A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated approach to dynamic programming, considering all possible combinations of subtask solutions across tasks within the given time limit.
