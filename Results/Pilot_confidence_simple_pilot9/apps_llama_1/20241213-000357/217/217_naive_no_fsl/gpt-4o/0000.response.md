Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It takes the input sequence `a` and splits it into two sequences `b` and `c` in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. The sum of elements in `b` is `B`, and the sum of elements in `c` is `C`. The program then calculates the maximum possible value of `B - C` by including all positive numbers in `b` and all negative numbers in `c`, which results in the maximum possible difference between `B` and `C`.

In the given code, `B` is calculated as the sum of all positive numbers in the sequence `a`, and `C` is calculated as the sum of all negative numbers in the sequence `a`. This approach guarantees that the difference `B - C` is maximized, as including all positive numbers in `b` and all negative numbers in `c` will always result in the largest possible difference.

The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. For instance, in the first example, the program will choose `b = {1, 0}` (although `0` is not included in `B` because of the condition `x > 0`) and `c = {-2}`, resulting in `B = 1` and `C = -2`, which gives `B - C = 3`, as expected.

The program handles the edge cases correctly as well, such as when the sequence `a` contains only positive numbers, only negative numbers, or a mix of both, including zeros. In all these cases, the program will correctly calculate the maximum possible value of `B - C`.

Given the implementation and the logic behind it, the program works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem, and thus, it is correct.
