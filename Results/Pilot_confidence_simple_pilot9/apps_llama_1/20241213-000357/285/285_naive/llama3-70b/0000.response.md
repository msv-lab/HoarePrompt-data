Correctness: **True**.

The provided program attempts to determine whether it's possible to spend all of Kolya's initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. 

The program works by iterating through all possible combinations of houses (a), cars (b), and computers (c) that can be bought with the given amount of game-coins (n). 

For each combination of houses and cars, the program calculates the number of computers that can be bought with the remaining amount of game-coins. If the total cost of houses, cars, and computers equals the initial amount of game-coins (n), the program outputs 'YES' and exits.

The program iterates over all possible values of a (number of houses) from 0 to n // 1234567 (the maximum number of houses that can be bought with n game-coins) and for each value of a, it iterates over all possible values of b (number of cars) from 0 to (n - a * 1234567) // 123456 (the maximum number of cars that can be bought with the remaining amount of game-coins after buying a houses).

This ensures that all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers are considered, and if no combination is found that equals the initial amount of game-coins (n), the program outputs 'NO'.

The program seems to correctly implement the problem description, and there are no obvious edge cases or potential issues that it does not handle. 

Therefore, based on the given code and problem description, the program appears to be correct.
