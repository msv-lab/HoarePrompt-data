 Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program takes an integer `n` as input, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score.
2. It defines the costs of houses, cars, and computers as `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` respectively.
3. The program then iterates over all possible combinations of houses (`a`) and cars (`b`) that Kolya could have bought, given his initial game-coin score `n`.
4. For each combination of houses and cars, it calculates the remaining game-coins after buying the houses and cars.
5. If the remaining game-coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`), it means that Kolya can buy a combination of houses, cars, and computers that exactly equals his initial game-coin score `n`.
6. In this case, the program returns `'YES'`, indicating that it is possible for Kolya to have spent all his initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers.
7. If the program iterates over all possible combinations and finds no solution, it returns `'NO'`, indicating that it is not possible for Kolya to have spent all his initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and its logic aligns with the problem description. I couldn't find any example where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
