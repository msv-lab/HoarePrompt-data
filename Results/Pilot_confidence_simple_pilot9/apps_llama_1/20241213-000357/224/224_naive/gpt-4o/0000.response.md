Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations where $f(p)$ equals $f_{max}(n)$. The function `func_1(n, mod)` calculates the factorial of `n`, but this is not the correct solution to the problem.

To find the correct solution, we need to consider the definition of $f(p)$ and $f_{max}(n)$. The maximum value $f_{max}(n)$ is achieved when the permutation $p$ contains the numbers $1, 2, 3,..., n$ in a way that the GCD of the prefix of length $i$ is different from the GCD of the prefix of length $i-1$ for as many $i$ as possible.

However, the program simply calculates the factorial of `n-1`, which does not take into account the specific structure of the permutations that achieve $f_{max}(n)$. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

A counterexample is when `n = 3`. The program calculates `func_1(2, MOD) = 2`, but the correct answer is `4`, as there are four permutations `p` of length `3` where $f(p) = f_{max}(3) = 2$: `[2,1,3]`, `[2,3,1]`, `[3,1,2]`, and `[3,2,1]`.
