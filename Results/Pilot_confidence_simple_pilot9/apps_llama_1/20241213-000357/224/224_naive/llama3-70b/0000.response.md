Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the code lies in the `func_2` function. The function is intended to calculate the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`. However, the current implementation simply calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers from `1` to `n`, which is not equivalent to finding the maximum value of `f(p)`.

A correct implementation of `func_2` would involve calculating the GCD of all prefixes of each permutation and then finding the maximum number of distinct GCDs among all permutations.

Another issue with the code is that the `func_3` function does not correctly calculate the number of permutations `p` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max_n`. The current implementation uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of permutations, but it does not take into account the fact that the GCD of the prefixes of a permutation can change as the permutation is constructed.

A correct implementation of `func_3` would involve generating all permutations of the numbers from `1` to `n`, calculating the GCD of each prefix of each permutation, and then counting the number of permutations that have the maximum number of distinct GCDs.

For example, when `n = 3`, the `func_2` function returns `1`, which is incorrect. The correct maximum value of `f(p)` for `n = 3` is `2`, which can be achieved by the permutations `[2, 1, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, `[3, 1, 2]`, and `[3, 2, 1]`. The `func_3` function should return `4` for `n = 3`, but the current implementation returns a different value. 

Here's a simple example where the code fails:
Input:
```
3
```
The output should be `4`, but the code does not produce the correct output.
