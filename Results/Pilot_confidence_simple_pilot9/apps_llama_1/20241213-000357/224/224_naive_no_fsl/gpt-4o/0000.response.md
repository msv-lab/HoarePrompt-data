Correctness: **False**

The given program is attempting to calculate the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`. However, it does not correctly solve the problem. The issue is that it simply calculates the factorial of `n-1` for `n > 2`, which does not consider the actual algorithm required to calculate `f(p)` and `f_max(n)`.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when `n = 6`. According to the problem description, `f_max(6)` is the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `6`, and we need to count the number of permutations `p` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(6)`. The program simply returns `5! = 120`, which is not necessarily the correct answer.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value `f_max(n)` and then count the number of permutations `p` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`. This requires implementing the function `f(p)` and iterating over all permutations of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`. The given program does not implement this algorithm correctly.
