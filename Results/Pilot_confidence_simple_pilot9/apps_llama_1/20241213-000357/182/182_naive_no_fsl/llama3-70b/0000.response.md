Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function appears to correctly implement the necessary logic to determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation of an image from vertical, given the camera's rotation angle.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It first reads the camera's rotation angle from the input and stores it in the variable `x`.
2. It then normalizes the angle to the range [-360, 360) by taking the modulus of `x` with 360. This is done to simplify the subsequent calculations.
3. If the normalized angle `x` is 0, it means the camera is not rotated, so the function prints 0, indicating no turns are needed.
4. Otherwise, the function calculates the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns required using the formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`.

The formula works as follows:

- The expression `x + 90` shifts the angle to the range [90, 450), which allows us to calculate the number of 90 degrees clockwise turns needed to reach an angle that minimizes the deviation from vertical.
- The expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90` calculates the number of 90 degrees clockwise turns needed to reach an angle that is closest to a multiple of 90 degrees. The `- 1` is used to handle cases where `x` is a multiple of 90.
- The `% 4` expression ensures that the result is within the range [0, 3], which corresponds to 0, 1, 2, or 3 turns.

The function's logic seems to cover all possible cases, and the provided examples demonstrate its correctness. Therefore, it appears that the program is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.
