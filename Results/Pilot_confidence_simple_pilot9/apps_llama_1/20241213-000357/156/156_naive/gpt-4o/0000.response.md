Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly simulates Lara's movement through the dungeon and determines her current position after moving `k` times.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If `k` is less than `n-1`, it means Lara has not yet reached the bottom left corner of the dungeon. In this case, her current position is the `k+1`-th row in the first column, which is correctly calculated by `print(k+1, 1)`.

2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it means Lara has reached the bottom left corner and has started moving in a snake-like pattern. The program calculates the number of full rows Lara has traversed (`full_rows = k // (m-1)`) and the remaining steps in the current row (`remaining_steps = k % (m-1)`).

3. Depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, the program determines the current row and column of Lara's position. If `full_rows` is even, the row is calculated as `n - full_rows`, and the column is `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, the row is the same, but the column is `m - remaining_steps`.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where `k` is 0 or `n*m - 1`, which means Lara is at the starting position or the ending position, respectively. The examples provided also demonstrate the program's correctness.

Overall, the program accurately simulates Lara's movement and determines her current position after moving `k` times, making it correct for all potential cases.
