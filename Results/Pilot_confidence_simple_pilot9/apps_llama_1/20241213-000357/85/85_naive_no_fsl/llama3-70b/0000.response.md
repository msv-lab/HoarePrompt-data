Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all cases. 

The issue with the given code is that it only checks for pairs of numbers where one is `i` and the other is `n-i`. However, the problem statement asks for pairs of shovels where the total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The total cost of two shovels is `i + j`, not `i + (n - i)`.

For example, if `n = 10`, the program will only check for pairs `(1, 9)`, `(2, 8)`, `(3, 7)`, `(4, 6)`, and `(5, 5)`. However, it should also check for pairs like `(1, 8)`, `(2, 7)`, `(3, 6)`, and so on.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible pairs of shovels and check if their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    count = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            total = i + j
            nines = 0
            while total % 10 == 9:
                nines += 1
                total //= 10
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                count = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                count += 1
    print(count)
```

This code iterates over all possible pairs of shovels, calculates the total cost, and checks if it ends with the maximum possible number of nines. If it finds a pair with more nines than the current maximum, it updates the maximum and resets the count. If it finds a pair with the same number of nines as the current maximum, it increments the count.
