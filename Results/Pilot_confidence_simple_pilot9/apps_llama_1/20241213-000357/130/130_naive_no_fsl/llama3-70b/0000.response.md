Correctness: **True**

The program seems to be correct based on the problem description. The conditions for the friends to gift coins to Ivan are:

1. Everyone must gift as many coins as others.
2. All coins given to Ivan must be different.
3. Not less than L coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

The program checks if the number of friends (M) is greater than or equal to the number of coins that Ivan doesn't have (N - K + 1) and if M is also greater than or equal to L. If both conditions are met, it prints 1, meaning that each friend can gift 1 coin, and the conditions will be satisfied.

This logic is correct because if M is greater than or equal to N - K + 1, it guarantees that each friend can give a unique coin that Ivan doesn't have. Also, if M is greater than or equal to L, it ensures that the total number of new coins given to Ivan is at least L.

The program handles the edge case where it's impossible to satisfy the conditions by printing -1. This happens when M is less than N - K + 1 or M is less than L, indicating that the friends cannot give unique coins or the total number of new coins is less than L.

The examples provided in the problem description also support the correctness of the program. In the first test case, the program correctly outputs 1, and in the second test case, it correctly outputs -1.

Overall, the program seems to be correct based on the problem description and the examples provided.
