Correctness: **True**.

The program provided appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

The logic behind the code is as follows:

- It calculates the minimum number of coins (`min_x`) that each friend needs to give to Ivan, such that at least `L` new coins are guaranteed to be added to Ivan's collection. This is done by dividing `L` by `M` (the number of friends) and rounding up to the nearest integer using `(L + M - 1) // M`.
- It then checks if it's possible to satisfy the condition of each friend giving `min_x` coins, without exceeding the total number of different coins that can be given (`N - K`), where `N` is the total number of different coins and `K` is the number of coins Ivan already has. 
- If the condition `M * min_x <= N - K` is met, it means that it's possible for each friend to give `min_x` coins without exceeding the total number of different coins that can be given, and the program prints `min_x`.
- If the condition `M * min_x <= N - K` is not met, it means that it's impossible to satisfy the conditions, and the program prints `-1`.

This logic correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It checks if it's possible to satisfy the conditions and prints the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give if it is, or `-1` if it's not. 

The provided examples also support the correctness of the program, as it produces the expected output for both cases. 

Without being able to find a counterexample where the program does not work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.
