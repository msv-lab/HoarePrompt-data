Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. It simply generates all divisors of the input number `n` and creates fractions of the form `1/d` for each divisor `d`. However, the problem requires that the sum of these fractions equals `1 - 1/n`.

For example, if `n = 6`, the program will output `YES` followed by the fractions `1 2`, `1 3`, and `1 6`. However, the sum of these fractions is `1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 6/6 = 1`, which does not equal `1 - 1/6 = 5/6`.

A correct implementation would need to carefully select the fractions to ensure that their sum equals `1 - 1/n`. The given program does not perform this check and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.

Here is an example where the code fails: Input `n = 6`, the code outputs `YES` followed by the fractions `1 2`, `1 3`, `1 6` but the correct output should be `YES` followed by the fractions `1 2`, `1 3` because `1/2 + 1/3 = 1 - 1/6`. 

The code should check if the sum of fractions is equal to `1 - 1/n` before printing the result. 

In the given code, the function `func_1(n)` returns 'YES' and the fractions as soon as it finds any divisors of `n`, without checking if the sum of the fractions is equal to `1 - 1/n`. This is the main reason why the code is incorrect. 

To fix this, we need to modify the code to only return 'YES' if the sum of the fractions is equal to `1 - 1/n`. 

In addition to the incorrect handling of the sum of fractions, the code also includes `n` itself as a divisor when `n` is not a square, which is incorrect according to the problem description. 

To fix this, we need to modify the code to only consider divisors `d` such that `1 < d < n`. 

Here's how the corrected code could look:

```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i!= n // i and n // i < n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(1, 2**len(divisors)):
        subset = [divisors[j] for j in range(len(divisors)) if (i >> j) & 1]
        sum_fractions = sum(1 / d for d in subset)
        if math.isclose(sum_fractions, 1 - 1/n):
            return f'YES\n{len(subset)}\n' + '\n'.join(f'1 {d}' for d in subset)
    return 'NO'

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)
