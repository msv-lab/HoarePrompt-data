Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks for divisors of the input number `n` and returns a sequence of fractions where each numerator is 1 and each denominator is a divisor of `n`. However, the problem requires that the sum of these fractions be equal to `1 - 1/n`.

For example, when `n = 6`, the program correctly returns `YES` and the sequence `1/2, 1/3`, which sums to `1 - 1/6`. However, when `n = 4`, the program returns `YES` and the sequence `1/2, 1/4`, which sums to `3/4`, not `1 - 1/4 = 3/4`. But this is correct. 

However, the issue is that the program assumes that all divisors of `n` should be included in the sequence, which is not necessarily the case. It does not consider the sum of the fractions and whether it equals `1 - 1/n`.

A counterexample is when `n = 5`. The program returns `YES` and the sequence `1/5`, but this does not satisfy the condition `1/5 = 1 - 1/5`, since `1/5` equals `0.2` and `1 - 1/5 = 4/5 = 0.8`. However, the problem description requires that the sequence of fractions sums to `1 - 1/n`, which in this case is `4/5`.

So the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, specifically for `n = 5` and potentially other values of `n`. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect. 

To correctly solve the problem, a more complex approach would be needed, potentially involving a search for the correct sequence of fractions or a proof that no such sequence exists for certain values of `n`.
