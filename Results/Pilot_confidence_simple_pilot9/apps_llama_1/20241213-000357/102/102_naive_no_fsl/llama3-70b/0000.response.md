Correctness: **True**

The program provided appears to correctly solve the problem described. It iterates over all possible non-negative integer values of x (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) up to n/a (since x*a cannot exceed n), calculates the corresponding y (the number of Bars bars) such that x*a + y*b equals n, and checks if the equation holds. If it finds a pair (x, y) that satisfies the equation, it prints 'YES' along with the values of x and y, and exits. If no such pair is found after checking all possible values of x, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the requirements specified in the problem description:

1. It considers all non-negative integer numbers of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars.
2. It checks for the condition where the total cost equals n burles.
3. It provides the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

All the example test cases provided also work correctly with this program, and no counterexample was found where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is considered correct.
