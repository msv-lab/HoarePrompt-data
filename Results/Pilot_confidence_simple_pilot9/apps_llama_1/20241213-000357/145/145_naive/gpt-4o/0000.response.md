Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The issue lies in the fact that the program only considers segments of a fixed length, which is not the requirement. The problem statement allows segments of varying lengths as long as their sums are equal.

For example, consider the input `n = 4` and `ticket = 1122`. The program will return "NO" because it only checks for segments of lengths 1 and 2, but the ticket can be divided into segments of lengths 1 and 3 with equal sums: 1, 1, and 22 (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 and 2 + 2 = 4).

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible segment lengths and positions, not just a fixed length. This can be achieved by using a more dynamic approach, such as iterating over all possible segment start and end indices, calculating the sum of each segment, and checking if the sums are equal. 

Here is a simple example of how the corrected program might look like:

```python
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for target_sum in range(1, sum(map(int, ticket))):
        segments = []
        current_sum = 0
        current_segment = []
        for digit in ticket:
            current_sum += int(digit)
            current_segment.append(digit)
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                segments.append(current_segment)
                current_sum = 0
                current_segment = []
        if current_sum == 0 and len(segments) > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

This version of the program correctly checks all possible segment sums and returns "YES" if it finds a sum that can be used to divide the ticket into two or more segments. Otherwise, it returns "NO".
