Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. Here's why:

1.  The program first reads the number of digits and the base for both numbers X and Y.
2.  It then reads the digits of X and Y.
3.  The `func_1` function is used to convert the digits of X and Y from their respective bases to decimal.
4.  The conversion is done by iterating over the digits from left to right (most significant to least significant) and calculating the decimal value using the formula `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit`.
5.  Once both numbers are converted to decimal, the program compares them and prints the result.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

*   Different bases for X and Y
*   Different numbers of digits for X and Y
*   Leading zeroes are not present in the input, as specified in the problem description
*   All digits are given in the standard decimal numeral system

The provided examples in the problem description are also handled correctly by the program.

Since the program correctly implements the logic for comparing numbers in different bases and handles all possible cases according to the problem description, it is correct.
