Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions. It simply counts all the lowercase letters in the string, which does not guarantee that there are no uppercase letters between the positions.

A counterexample can be the string "aBa". The program will output 2, because there are two lowercase letters. However, there is an uppercase letter 'B' between them, so the correct output should be 1.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to use a more complex approach, such as dynamic programming, to ensure that we are considering all possible combinations of positions and checking that there are no uppercase letters between them. 

For example, here is a corrected version of the function in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_len = 0

    for mask in range(1 << n):
        positions = [i for i in range(n) if (mask & (1 << i))]
        lowercase = True
        distinct = len(positions) == len(set([s[i] for i in positions]))
        valid = True

        for i in range(len(positions) - 1):
            for j in range(positions[i] + 1, positions[i + 1]):
                if s[j].isupper():
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break

        for pos in positions:
            if not s[pos].islower():
                lowercase = False
                break

        if lowercase and distinct and valid:
            max_len = max(max_len, len(positions))

    print(max_len)
```
This corrected function uses a bitmask to generate all possible combinations of positions, checks if the letters at these positions are lowercase and distinct, and if there are no uppercase letters between them. It then updates the maximum length accordingly.
