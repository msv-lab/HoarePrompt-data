Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length x into an equilateral triangle of side length y. 

The issue lies in the line `print(abs(x - y))`, which simply calculates the absolute difference between the starting and ending side lengths. However, the problem statement requires modifying the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area) at each step.

A counterexample can be found with the input `6 3`. The program will output `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output, as shown in the problem description, is `4`. This is because the transformation requires a series of steps that modify the triangle's sides in a way that maintains its non-degenerate property at each step.

For example, one possible sequence of transformations is `(6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3)`, which indeed takes 4 steps.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
