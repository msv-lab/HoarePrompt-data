Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

For example, let's consider the input: `5 4 4`. The area should be `5` (since `n*m/k = 5*4/4 = 5`).

However, the program will print `YES` followed by the points `(0 0)`, `(10 1)`, and `(0 1)`. The problem is that the point `(10 1)` is outside the given bounds (`0 <= x <= n` and `0 <= y <= m`), since `10` is greater than `5`.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case, making it incorrect.
