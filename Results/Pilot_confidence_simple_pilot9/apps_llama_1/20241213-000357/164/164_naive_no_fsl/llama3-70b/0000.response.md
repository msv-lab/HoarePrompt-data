Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n]!= '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` is incorrect because it checks if the obstacles are between the start and end position in the sequence order, but it does not consider the jump pattern of the grasshopper.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the obstacles are in such a way that they are not in the sequence order but are still in the path of the jump. For example, if the input is `6 2` and the string is `T.G..#G`, the program will incorrectly output `YES` because it does not consider the obstacle in the jump path.

The correct condition should be to check if there is a path from the start position to the end position by jumping `k` steps at a time, considering the circular nature of the jump. The program should use a more sophisticated approach like BFS or DFS to find the path. 

Here is an example of how the program could be corrected using BFS:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        queue = deque([g])
        visited = {g}
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            if current == t:
                print('YES')
                return
            for next_pos in [current + k, current - k]:
                if 0 <= next_pos < n and next_pos not in visited and s[next_pos]!= '#':
                    queue.append(next_pos)
                    visited.add(next_pos)
        print('NO')

```
