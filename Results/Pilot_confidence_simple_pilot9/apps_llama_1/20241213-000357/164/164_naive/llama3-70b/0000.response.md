Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not properly handle the case where the grasshopper can jump over obstacles to reach the target. 

The line of code `all((s[(g + i * k) % n]!= '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` checks if all the cells that the grasshopper will land on during its jumps are empty, but it does not consider the fact that the grasshopper can jump over obstacles.

However, a more significant issue with the code is that it only checks if the grasshopper can reach the target in a single sequence of jumps, from its initial position to the target, without considering the possibility of reaching the target in multiple jumps, potentially visiting the same cell multiple times.

For example, if the input is `6 2` and the string is `...G..T`, the grasshopper can jump to the right twice to reach the target, but the code will incorrectly return 'NO' because it only checks if the grasshopper can reach the target in a single sequence of jumps.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to implement a more complex algorithm that can handle these cases, such as a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. 

Here is a potential correct implementation:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i

    visited = set()
    queue = deque([g])

    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        if current == t:
            print('YES')
            return

        if current in visited:
            continue

        visited.add(current)

        for jump in [k, -k]:
            new_position = current + jump
            if 0 <= new_position < n and s[new_position]!= '#':
                queue.append(new_position)

    print('NO')
```
