Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it handles all possible cases according to the problem description.

Here's the explanation:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the program simply prints `t`, which is the number of spectators standing at time `t`. This is correct because, at time `t`, the first `t` spectators are standing.

2. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the program prints `k`, which is the number of spectators standing at time `t`. This is correct because, after the first `k` spectators have stood, the number of spectators standing at any time will be `k` until the end of the first wave.

3. If `t` is greater than `n`, the program prints `n + k - t`, which is the number of spectators standing at time `t`. This is correct because, after the first wave has ended, the number of spectators standing decreases by one at each time step, so the number of spectators standing at time `t` is `k` minus the number of time steps that have passed since the end of the first wave.

Since the program handles all possible cases correctly, it is correct for every potential case. 

I couldn't find any example where the program does not work correctly according to the description, so the program is correct.
