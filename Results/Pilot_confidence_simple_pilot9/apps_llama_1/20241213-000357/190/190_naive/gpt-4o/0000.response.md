Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It tries all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100 and calculates the total cost of changing the lengths of the sticks to be almost good for each `t`. It keeps track of the `t` value with the minimum cost and finally prints this `t` value and the corresponding minimum cost.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the number of sticks is 1 or all sticks have the same length. It also correctly handles cases where the optimal `t` value is at the boundaries (i.e., 1 or 100).

The program's logic is sound, and it does not miss any potential cases. The use of a brute-force approach to try all possible `t` values ensures that the program finds the optimal solution.

The time complexity of the program is O(n*m), where n is the number of sticks and m is the range of possible `t` values (in this case, 100). This is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

Overall, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
