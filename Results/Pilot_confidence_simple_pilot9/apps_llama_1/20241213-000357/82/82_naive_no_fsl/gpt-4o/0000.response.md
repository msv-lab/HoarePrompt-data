Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case when the optimal `k` is 0. In the problem description, it is stated that if there are multiple optimal integers `k`, the smallest one should be chosen. However, in the provided program, the loop for `k` starts from 1, and 0 is not considered.

When `a` and `b` are already multiples of their least common multiple (LCM), the smallest possible `k` is indeed 0, as adding 0 to both `a` and `b` results in the smallest possible LCM. 

For example, if `a = 6` and `b = 12`, the LCM of `a` and `b` is 12. Since both `a` and `b` are already multiples of 6, adding 0 to both results in 6 and 12, and their LCM remains 12, which is the smallest possible.

However, the provided program does not consider `k = 0` and will return a non-zero value for `k` in such cases. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
