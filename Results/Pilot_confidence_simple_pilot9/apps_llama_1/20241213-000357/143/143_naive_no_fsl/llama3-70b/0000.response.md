Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to find the minimum cost of buying at least L liters of lemonade. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The program initializes a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` with `L + 1` elements, all set to infinity except `dp[0]`, which is set to 0. This represents the minimum cost of buying 0 liters of lemonade, which is 0.

2. The program then iterates over each volume from 1 to L. For each volume `i`, it iterates over each bottle type `j`.

3. For each bottle type `j`, it calculates the volume `vol` of the bottle, which is `2 ** j - 1`. If the volume of the bottle is less than or equal to the current volume `i`, it updates the DP table `dp[i]` with the minimum cost of buying the current volume `i` by either buying the current bottle and adding its cost to the minimum cost of buying the remaining volume (`dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`) or not buying the current bottle (`dp[i]`).

4. Finally, the program prints the minimum cost of buying at least L liters of lemonade, which is stored in `dp[L]`. If `dp[L]` is still infinity after the iterations, it means that it's impossible to buy at least L liters of lemonade with the given bottle types, so the program prints -1.

The program works correctly for all the provided examples and should work correctly for all possible inputs because it considers all possible combinations of buying bottles to achieve the minimum cost. The time complexity of the program is O(nL), where n is the number of bottle types and L is the required amount of lemonade, which is efficient enough to handle the given constraints.
