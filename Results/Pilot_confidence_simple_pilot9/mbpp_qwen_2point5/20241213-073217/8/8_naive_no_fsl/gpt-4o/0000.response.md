Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string. Let's analyze some edge cases:

1. **Case with Multiple Occurrences**: The function handles strings with multiple occurrences of the character correctly. For example, `func_1('abcda', 'a')` returns `'bcd'`.
2. **Case with Single Occurrence**: If the character appears only once, the function returns the string as is, which is correct. For example, `func_1('PHP', 'P')` returns `'H'`.
3. **Case with No Occurrence**: If the character does not appear in the string, the function returns the string as is, which is also correct. For example, `func_1('world', 'z')` would return `'world'`.
4. **Case with Edge Characters**: If the character is at the beginning or end of the string, the function correctly removes these occurrences. For example, `func_1('hello', 'l')` returns `'heo'`.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly, and no counterexample was found where the function does not meet the requirements, the program is correct.
