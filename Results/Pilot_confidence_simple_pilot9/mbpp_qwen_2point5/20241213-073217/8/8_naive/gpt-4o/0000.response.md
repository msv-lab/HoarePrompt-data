Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. It handles cases where the character is not found in the string, or when the first and last occurrences are the same index. The function uses `find` and `rfind` to locate the indices of the first and last occurrences of the character, and then constructs a new string without these occurrences. The test cases provided also validate its correctness across different scenarios.
