Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists using a case-insensitive comparison (`key=str.lower`). This means that the function will sort the sublists correctly regardless of the capitalization of the strings. Since the function uses a list comprehension to apply the `sorted` function to each sublist, it will handle any input list of lists of strings appropriately. There are no obvious edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the provided problem description.
