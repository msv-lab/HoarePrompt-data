Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the given string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring and then calculates the ending index correctly. There doesn't seem to be any missing logic or edge cases that this code is not handling based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
