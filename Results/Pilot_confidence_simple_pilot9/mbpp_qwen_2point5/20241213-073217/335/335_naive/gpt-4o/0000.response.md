Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the main string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting position of the substring and calculates the end position accordingly. The test cases provided cover various scenarios, including exact matches and non-matches, and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the function works correctly for the given problem description.
