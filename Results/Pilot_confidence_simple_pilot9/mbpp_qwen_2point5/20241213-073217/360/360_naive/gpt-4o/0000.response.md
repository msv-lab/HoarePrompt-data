Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list within the list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The function iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. The provided test cases cover various scenarios including lists of different lengths and values, and the function passes all these tests. Since the function works correctly for the given examples and no other edge cases were identified that the function might fail, we can conclude that the function is correct.
