Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The function handles all potential cases where the expression could be balanced or unbalanced, including edge cases such as empty strings and expressions with mismatched or unbalanced brackets. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
