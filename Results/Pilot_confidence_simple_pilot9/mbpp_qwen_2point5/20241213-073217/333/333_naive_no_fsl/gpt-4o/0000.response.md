Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly check if the given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket. 

Let's analyze a few more cases to ensure thoroughness:

1. `func_1('()')` should return `True`.
2. `func_1('[]')` should return `True`.
3. `func_1('{}')` should return `True`.
4. `func_1('([{}])')` should return `True`.
5. `func_1('([{]}))')` should return `False`.

Given the structure of the function and the provided test cases, it handles various scenarios correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the provided examples and additional reasoning. Therefore, the function seems to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
