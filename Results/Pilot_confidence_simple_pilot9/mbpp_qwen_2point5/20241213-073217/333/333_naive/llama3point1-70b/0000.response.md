Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and ensures that each corresponding closing bracket matches the last unmatched opening bracket. The function handles all possible cases where the expression is balanced or unbalanced, including edge cases like empty strings and strings with only opening or closing brackets. Since the function works correctly for all potential cases, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
