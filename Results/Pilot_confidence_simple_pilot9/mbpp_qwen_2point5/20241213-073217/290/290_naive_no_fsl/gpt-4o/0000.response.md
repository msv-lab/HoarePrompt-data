Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where 'z' appears at the beginning or the end of the string. For example, `func_1('pzxyz')` should return `True` because 'z' is found in the middle of the string, but the current implementation will return `False`. Additionally, the space before and after the string in the third test case `func_1('  lang  .')` should not affect the result, but the function returns `False`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
