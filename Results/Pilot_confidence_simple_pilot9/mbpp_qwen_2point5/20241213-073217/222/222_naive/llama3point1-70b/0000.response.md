Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the given string. Instead, it only keeps uppercase characters and removes all other characters. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the expected output would be "HW", but the program will return an empty string because it does not handle the removal of lowercase substrings as described. A correct implementation would involve removing any substring that contains lowercase characters, not just individual lowercase characters.
