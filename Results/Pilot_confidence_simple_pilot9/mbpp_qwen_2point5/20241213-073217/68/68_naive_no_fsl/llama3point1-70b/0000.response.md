Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly computes the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function from the `cmath` module. The function takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It creates a complex number from these parts and then returns its phase angle.

Given the problem description to get the angle of a complex number, the function `func_1` meets this requirement for all potential cases since the `cmath.phase` function handles all valid complex numbers appropriately, including zero and special cases like positive and negative infinity. Therefore, no specific case can be found where this function fails to meet the requirement.
