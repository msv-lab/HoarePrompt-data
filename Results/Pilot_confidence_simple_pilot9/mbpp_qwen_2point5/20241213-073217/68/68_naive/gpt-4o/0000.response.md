Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` method. The test cases given also correctly validate the function with different inputs:

- For `(0, 1j)`, the expected angle is approximately `1.5708` radians (90 degrees), which matches the result.
- For `(2, 1j)`, the expected angle is approximately `0.4636` radians (26.565 degrees), which also matches the result.
- For `(0, 2j)`, the expected angle is again approximately `1.5708` radians (90 degrees), matching the result.

The function uses the `cmath.phase` method, which computes the phase angle of a complex number, ensuring the code works as expected for the given problem description. No edge cases or potential issues were found that would make the program incorrect.
