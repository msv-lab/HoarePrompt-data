Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The function works by first checking if the tuple is empty, in which case it returns `True`. Otherwise, it determines the type of the first element and then iterates through the rest of the tuple to ensure all elements match this type. 

The test cases provided cover different scenarios:
1. An all-integer tuple: `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True`
2. A mixed-type tuple: `func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False`
3. Another all-integer tuple: `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True`

Since the function handles these cases correctly and the logic appears sound, it should work for all potential cases where the tuple contains elements of the same or different data types. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail based on the given problem description and examples.
