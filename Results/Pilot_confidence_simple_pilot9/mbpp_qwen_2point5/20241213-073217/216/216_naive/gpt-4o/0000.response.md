Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program checks if a list contains consecutive numbers by sorting the list and then checking the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. However, this approach fails when the list contains duplicate numbers that are not consecutive. For example, consider the list `[1, 1, 2]`. The program will sort the list to `[1, 1, 2]` and then check the differences between adjacent elements. Since the difference between the first two elements is `0`, the program will incorrectly return `False`.

To handle this case correctly, the program should remove duplicates before performing the check. Here is an example of how to modify the function to handle duplicates:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(set(lst))
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True
```

This modified function first removes duplicates using `set()` before performing the check, ensuring that it correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers, including those with duplicates.
