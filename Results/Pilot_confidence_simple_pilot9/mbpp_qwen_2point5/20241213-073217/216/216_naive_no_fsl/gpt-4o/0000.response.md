Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. It first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then it sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each pair of adjacent elements has a difference of 1. If any pair does not satisfy this condition, it immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- A list with consecutive numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (expected output: `True`)
- A list with non-consecutive numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` (expected output: `False`)
- A list with repeated numbers (not consecutive): `[1, 2, 1]` (expected output: `False`)

Since the function handles these cases correctly and there are no obvious edge cases that the function fails to handle based on the provided information, the program is correct.
