Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The function iterates through all indices from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index is even, and if so, adds the corresponding binomial coefficient to the sum. This approach is valid because the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{i}\) is defined for all non-negative integers \( i \) up to \( n \), and the function correctly sums those coefficients for which \( i \) is even.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program handles all potential cases as expected without any logical errors or omissions. Therefore, the program is correct.
