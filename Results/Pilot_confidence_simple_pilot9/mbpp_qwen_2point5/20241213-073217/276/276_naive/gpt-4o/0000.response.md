Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The approach involves merging the two lists, sorting the combined list, and then finding the median based on the length of the merged list. This method works for all potential cases since:

1. The merging and sorting of the lists ensures that the combined list is properly ordered.
2. The calculation of the median handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list correctly.

Given the examples provided, the function works as expected:

- For `[1, 12, 15, 26, 38]` and `[2, 13, 17, 30, 45]`, the merged and sorted list is `[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]`, and the median is `16.0`.
- For `[2, 4, 8, 9]` and `[7, 13, 19, 28]`, the merged and sorted list is `[2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 19, 28]`, and the median is `8.5`.
- For `[3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42]` and `[2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55]`, the merged and sorted list is `[2, 3, 6, 14, 18, 23, 27, 36, 39, 42, 49, 55]`, and the median is `25.0`.

Since the program handles the provided examples correctly and the logic is sound, it is correct for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
