Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s` using the built-in `count` method. This method handles all potential cases, including overlapping occurrences, which is what we want for counting 'std' in a string. Since the function works as expected for any input string, the program is correct.
