Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicate elements from the list and then calculates the sum of the remaining unique elements. This approach is correct for finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. 

The function works as expected for the provided test cases:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the unique elements are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and their sum is `21`.
- For the input `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]`, the unique elements are `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 45]` and their sum is `71`.
- For the input `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]`, the unique elements are `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2]` and their sum is `78`.

Since the function handles the examples correctly and the logic is sound, it is correct for the given problem description. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the provided assertions.
