Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. This matches the problem description accurately. Since the formula is correct and the program directly implements it without any logical errors or missing edge cases, it will work correctly for all valid inputs (positive values for radius and height). Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
