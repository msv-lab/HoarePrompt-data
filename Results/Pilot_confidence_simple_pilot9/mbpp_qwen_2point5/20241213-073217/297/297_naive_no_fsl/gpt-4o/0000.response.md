Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function works as expected for all the provided test cases:

- For the input `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the output is `(5, 35, 56, 80)`.
- For the input `(2, 4, 5, 6, 7)`, the output is `(8, 20, 30, 42)`.
- For the input `(12, 13, 14, 9, 15)`, the output is `(156, 182, 126, 135)`.

Additionally, the function handles the edge case where the input tuple has only one element correctly by returning an empty tuple. Since the function meets the requirements for all the potential cases presented, the correctness is **True**.
