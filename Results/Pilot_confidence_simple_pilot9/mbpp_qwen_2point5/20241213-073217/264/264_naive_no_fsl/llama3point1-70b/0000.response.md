Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula is consistent with the mathematical definition of converting degrees to radians. Since the function follows this formula and handles all inputs correctly, it meets the requirements for converting degrees to radians in every potential case.
