Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all characters in a string are the same. It handles an empty string correctly by returning `True`. For non-empty strings, it compares each character to the first character and returns `False` as soon as a different character is found. This logic ensures that the function works correctly for all cases based on the problem description. Since the examples provided also validate this behavior (`'python'` returns `False`, `'aaa'` returns `True`, and `'data'` returns `False`), the function appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
