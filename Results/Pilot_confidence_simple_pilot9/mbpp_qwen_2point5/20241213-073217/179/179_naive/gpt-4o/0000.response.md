Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Given the assertions:
- `func_1(2) == 72`
- `func_1(3) == 288`
- `func_1(4) == 800`

Let's verify the logic:
1. For `n=2`, the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
2. For `n=3`, the first three even natural numbers are 2, 4, and 6. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
3. For `n=4`, the first four even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, and 8. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\).

The program correctly generates the even numbers using the list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]` and then sums their cubes using a generator expression within the `sum()` function. Based on the provided examples and logical verification, the program works as expected for the given problem description.
