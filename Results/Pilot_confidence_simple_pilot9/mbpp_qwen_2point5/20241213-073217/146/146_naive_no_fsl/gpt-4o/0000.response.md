Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the maximum length in a list of lists. The function iterates through each list, updates the maximum length and the corresponding list whenever it finds a longer list. The function returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the list itself. All the provided test cases and the general logic of the function ensure that it works correctly for any list of lists where the inner lists can have varying lengths. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential scenario that the function does not handle correctly based on the given problem description.
