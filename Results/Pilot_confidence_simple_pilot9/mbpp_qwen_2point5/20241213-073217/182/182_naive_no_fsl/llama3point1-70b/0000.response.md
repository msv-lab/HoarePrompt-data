Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates through each string `s` in the tuple `strings` and appends the last character of each string to a new list. This implementation works for all potential cases where `strings` is a tuple of strings. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
