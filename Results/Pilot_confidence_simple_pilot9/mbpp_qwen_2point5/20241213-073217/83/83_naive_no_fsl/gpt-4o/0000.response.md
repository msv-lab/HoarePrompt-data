Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code appears to implement a variation of the Bubble Sort algorithm, but it does not seem to fully sort the list. Specifically, the `func_1` function uses a selection sort approach to find the maximum element in each pass and swaps it with the last unsorted element. However, this approach does not ensure that the entire list is sorted correctly after each pass. 

For example, consider the input `[3, 1, 2]`. The first pass finds the maximum element (3) and places it at the end, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`. The second pass finds the maximum element (2) and places it at the end, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`, which is partially sorted but not fully sorted according to the problem description.

The correct behavior would be to sort the entire list in ascending order. Since the provided code does not guarantee a fully sorted list after each pass, it fails to meet the requirements for sorting the entire list correctly. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
