Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the described functionality. It takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of `tup2` from `tup1`. The use of `zip` ensures that elements from both tuples are paired correctly, and the generator expression inside `tuple()` constructs the resulting tuple.

Since the program handles the operation as specified for any tuples of equal length, there are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause it to fail according to the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
