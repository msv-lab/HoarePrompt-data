Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function iterates over each position in the first tuple (assuming all tuples have the same length) and computes the average of the values at that position across all tuples. The given test cases demonstrate that the function works correctly for the provided inputs. Since the function handles the averaging process accurately and consistently across the provided examples, and there are no apparent edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
