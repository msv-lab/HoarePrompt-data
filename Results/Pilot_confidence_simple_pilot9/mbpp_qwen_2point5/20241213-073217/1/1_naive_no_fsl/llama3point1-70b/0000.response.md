Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) as input and returns a tuple containing the intersection of the two input tuples. This meets the requirement of finding shared elements from the given two lists (tuples in this case). The function uses sets to find the common elements, which ensures that the result is unique and works correctly for any input tuples, including edge cases like empty tuples or tuples with duplicate elements. Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, the program is correct.
