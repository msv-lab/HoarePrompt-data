Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The test cases provided in the assertions cover different scenarios:
1. A purely imaginary number with positive imaginary part (0 + 1j).
2. A complex number with both real and imaginary parts (2 + 1j).
3. A purely imaginary number with negative imaginary part (0 + 2j).

Since the function uses the `cmath.phase` function, which is designed to handle complex numbers and return their phase angle, the implementation is correct for the given problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or errors in the provided code that would cause it to fail for other potential inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
