Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list and then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is exactly 1. Additionally, it ensures that all elements in the list are unique by comparing the length of the list with the length of the set of the list. This approach correctly identifies whether the list contains consecutive numbers for all potential cases, as it handles both the order and uniqueness of the elements. Since no counterexample was found, the code is considered correct.
