Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. The function works as expected for the given assertions:

1. For the tuple `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)` and the element `4`, the function returns `0` because `4` is not present in the tuple.
2. For the tuple `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)` and the element `10`, the function returns `3` because `10` appears three times in the tuple.
3. For the tuple `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)` and the element `8`, the function returns `4` because `8` appears four times in the tuple.

Since the function handles these cases correctly and the `count` method works for any iterable, including tuples, the function is correct for all potential cases within the problem description.
