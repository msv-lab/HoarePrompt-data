Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both lists are empty. In this scenario, the function will attempt to access elements in the `merged_list`, which would lead to an `IndexError`. Additionally, the program assumes that the combined list size is even or odd and directly calculates the median without checking if the combined list is valid or not. This can lead to incorrect results if the input lists are not properly sorted or do not meet the conditions expected by the algorithm.
