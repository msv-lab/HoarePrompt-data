Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element, checks if the value matches the given element, and returns a tuple with `True` and the index if found, or `False` and `-1` if not found. The provided test cases cover some basic scenarios, and since the function logic is straightforward and there are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the function to fail, we can conclude that the function works correctly for the described problem.
