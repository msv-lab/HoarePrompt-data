Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \right) \times \text{length} \]

The function is tested with three assertions that cover different scenarios:

1. `func_1(10, 8, 6)` returns 240.
2. `func_1(3, 2, 2)` returns 6.
3. `func_1(1, 2, 1)` returns 1.

These test cases validate the function for different sets of values, and the calculations appear to be correct. Since the function handles the basic cases appropriately and follows the formula correctly, there are no potential cases found where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
