Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). This formula is correct for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, and the function correctly implements this formula. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail, as it handles the basic arithmetic operations needed for the calculation. Therefore, the function is correct for the given problem description.
