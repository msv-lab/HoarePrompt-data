Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days. It uses a list of month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the input month number `n` is in that list, and `False` otherwise. This approach covers all the relevant cases for month numbers 1 through 12. Since the function behaves as expected for all potential month numbers, the program is correct.
