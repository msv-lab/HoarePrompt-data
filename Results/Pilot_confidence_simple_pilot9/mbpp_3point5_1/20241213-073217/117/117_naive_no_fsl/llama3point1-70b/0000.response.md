Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list by using a generator expression with `isinstance(x, int)` inside the `sum()` function. This approach will iterate through each element in the list and sum up the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of whether each element is an instance of `int`. Therefore, the function will work correctly for all potential cases where the input is a list containing any type of elements.
