Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count how many times `x` is an instance of `int`. This approach works for all potential cases where the list contains elements of different types. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including a mix of integers, strings, and floats. Since the function behaves as expected for these cases and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
