Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns all even numbers from a given list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `numbers` and checks if the number is divisible by 2 (i.e., if `num % 2 == 0`). If the condition is met, the number is included in the returned list. This logic is correct and handles all potential cases, including edge cases such as an empty list or a list containing only odd numbers. Therefore, the function works as expected for all inputs related to finding even numbers from a list.
