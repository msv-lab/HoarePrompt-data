Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 30 days. It uses a list of month numbers that have 30 days and returns `True` if the input month is in this list, otherwise `False`. This logic correctly identifies months 4, 6, 9, and 11 as having 30 days, and correctly handles other months. Since there are no other months with exactly 30 days, the function works as expected for all potential cases.
