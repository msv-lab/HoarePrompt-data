Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a set to store the month numbers that have 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11) and returns `True` if the given month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. 

Given the problem description, the function handles all potential cases correctly:
- Month 4 has 30 days, so `func_1(4)` should return `True`.
- Month 2 does not have 30 days, so `func_1(2)` should return `False`.
- Month 12 does not have 30 days, so `func_1(12)` should return `False`.

Since the function works as expected for the provided test cases and no other potential edge cases violate the requirements, the program is correct.
