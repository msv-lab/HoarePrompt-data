Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach works correctly for all potential cases where the array contains at least two distinct elements. If the array has only one element, the function will still return 0, which is mathematically correct since the difference between the same element is 0. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
