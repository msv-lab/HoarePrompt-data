Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and then calculates the difference between these two values. This approach works for all possible inputs, including edge cases like arrays with duplicate elements, arrays with a single element, and arrays with both positive and negative numbers. Since the provided test cases also confirm its correctness, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
