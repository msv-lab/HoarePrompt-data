Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Let's verify this:

The function uses a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` to generate cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers starting from 2 up to `2n`. The `sum()` function then adds these cubes together.

For example:
- For `n = 1`, the function computes the cube of the first even number, which is \(2^3 = 8\).
- For `n = 2`, the function computes the cubes of the first two even numbers, which are \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).

This logic correctly implements the required functionality without any missing cases or edge cases that could cause the function to fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
