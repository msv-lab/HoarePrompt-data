Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct since an empty tuple trivially has all elements of the same type (or rather, no elements at all). The function also iterates through the tuple and compares the type of each element to the type of the first element. If any element's type differs, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The given test cases also confirm its correctness.
