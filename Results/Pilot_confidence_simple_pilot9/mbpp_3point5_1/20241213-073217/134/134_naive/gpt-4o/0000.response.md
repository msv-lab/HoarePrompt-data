Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients using the formula \(2^{n-1}\). This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices in the nth row of Pascal's triangle is \(2^{n-1}\).

Given the assertions:
- `func_1(4) == 8`: \(2^{4-1} = 2^3 = 8\)
- `func_1(6) == 32`: \(2^{6-1} = 2^5 = 32\)
- `func_1(2) == 2`: \(2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2\)

The program works correctly for these test cases and the formula holds true for any positive integer \(n\). Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
