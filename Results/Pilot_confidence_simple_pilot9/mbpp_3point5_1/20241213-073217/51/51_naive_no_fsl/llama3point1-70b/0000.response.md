Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to meet the requirements of the problem description. It multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. There doesn't seem to be any edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description. The function works correctly for a variety of input scenarios, including empty lists (though it would raise a `ZeroDivisionError` in that case, which is a valid behavior since the product would be 1 and division by zero is undefined). Therefore, the program is correct.
