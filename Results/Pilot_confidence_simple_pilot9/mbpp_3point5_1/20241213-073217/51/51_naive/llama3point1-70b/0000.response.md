Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. This operation is performed for any list of numbers, including edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, or a list with zero values. The function handles these cases appropriately:

- For an empty list, the product is 1 (since there are no elements to multiply), and dividing by the length (0) would result in 0 (though division by zero is undefined, the function implicitly handles this by returning 0 for an empty list).
- For a list with a single element, the product is simply that element, and dividing by the length (1) gives the same value.
- For a list with zero values, the product remains 0, and dividing by the length gives 0.

Since the function correctly performs the required operation for all potential cases without any logical errors, the program is correct.
