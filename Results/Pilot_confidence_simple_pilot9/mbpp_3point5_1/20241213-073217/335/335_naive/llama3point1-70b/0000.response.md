Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly return the start and end positions of the substring within the main string. According to the problem description, the function should return a tuple containing the substring, its start position, and its end position. However, the current implementation returns only the substring and incorrectly calculates the end position as `end - 1`.

For example, if `string = "hello"` and `substring = "lo"`, the expected output should be `("lo", 3, 4)`. However, the program would return `("lo", 3, 3)` because `end - 1` is `3`.

To fix this, the function should return `(substring, start, end)` instead of `(substring, start, end - 1)`.
