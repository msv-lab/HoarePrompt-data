Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly sort the list. The algorithm used in the function `func_1` does not guarantee that the list will be sorted in ascending order. For example, consider the input list `[1, 5, 4, 3, 2]`. The function will not sort this list correctly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works with this input:

1. `size = 5`: The maximum element is 5 at index 1. The function swaps the first two elements and then reverses the entire list, resulting in `[5, 1, 4, 3, 2]`.
2. `size = 4`: The maximum element is 5, which is already in the correct position, so no changes are made.
3. `size = 3`: The maximum element is 4 at index 2. The function swaps the first three elements and then reverses the first three elements, resulting in `[4, 1, 5, 3, 2]`.
4. `size = 2`: The maximum element is 5, which is already in the correct position, so no changes are made.
5. `size = 1`: The list is already partially sorted, but the final reverse operation might still change the order.

After these steps, the list is not fully sorted. A correct sorting algorithm would ensure that the list is sorted in ascending order after completing the iterations. Therefore, the provided code does not meet the requirement of sorting the list correctly for all possible inputs.
