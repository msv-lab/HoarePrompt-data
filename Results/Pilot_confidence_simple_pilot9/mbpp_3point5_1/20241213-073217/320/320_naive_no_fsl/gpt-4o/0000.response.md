Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in the list. It first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, then sorts the unique numbers, and finally returns the second element if it exists. This approach handles various edge cases:
- If the list contains duplicates (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`), the function correctly returns `None`.
- If the list has negative numbers and zeros (e.g., `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`), it correctly identifies `-2` as the second smallest number.
- If the list has repeated smallest numbers (e.g., `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`), it correctly identifies `-0.5` as the second smallest number.

Since the function works correctly for all the provided test cases and logical edge cases, the program is correct.
