Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to split a list into sublists at every nth element. The assertions provided also correctly test the function for different inputs, including edge cases like different list lengths and varying step sizes. Given the implementation and the test cases, the function works as expected for all tested scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.
