To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description given:

**Problem description:** Ivan's friends must gift him coins under three conditions. The program should ensure that:
1. Everyone must gift as many coins as others.
2. All coins given to Ivan must be different.
3. At least `L` coins from the gifts must be new in Ivan's collection, meaning the coins should not be includes in the `K` coins Ivan already has.

**Provided Program:**
```python
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

**Analysis of the provided program:**

1. **Condition Check:**
   - The first condition `M >= N - K + 1` ensures that the number of friends (M) is enough so that they can gift distinct coins while also taking into account that Ivan already has `K` of the total `N` coins. This means that the friends can at least give enough distinct new coins and the different coins do not exceed what's available.
   - The second condition `M >= L` checks if the number of friends is sufficient to gift at least `L` new coins.
   
2. **Output Logic:**
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program outputs `1`, indicating that each friend can gift 1 coin, which collectively satisfies the condition of unique gifts and ensures at least `L` new coins. 
   - If any of the conditions are not satisfied, it outputs `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to fulfill the gifting criteria.

**Identifying potential failure cases:**

1. **Case where M < L:** 
   - If Ivan has more friends than he needs to gift new coins, but not enough to fulfill the requirement of at least `L` new coins. For example, if `N = 10, M = 2, K = 1, L = 3`. The program would incorrectly output `-1`, while it's valid to gift 1 coin from each friend which would result in only 2 coins total, not satisfying `L`.

2. **Case where M > N - K:**
   - If the number of friends exceeds the available unique coins left after accounting for Ivan's collection, which would lead to the same conclusion. For example, if `N = 5, K = 3, M = 3, L = 1`, the program would output `-1`, but it is actually possible for each friend to gift at least 1.

**Conclusion:**
Given that the provided program has cases where the logic fails to account for different situations where gifting is deemed valid yet results in an incorrect output, an example demonstrated this effectively.

Correctness: **False**.
