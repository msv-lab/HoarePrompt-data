To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and edge cases.

### Problem Breakdown
Let's recap the requirements:
1. All friends must gift the same number of coins.
2. All gifted coins must be different.
3. At least `L` coins from the gifts must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Program Analysis
1. The program reads the four integers \( N, M, K, L \) from input.
2. It calculates `min_x` as the minimum number of coins each friend must gift which is calculated as `(L + M - 1) // M`. This ensures that the total number of new coins is at least `L`.
3. It checks if `M * min_x` (the total amount of coins gifted) is less than or equal to `N - K` (the number of coins left for gifting after excluding the ones Ivan already has).
4. If the condition holds true, it prints `min_x`, otherwise it prints `-1`.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum value for `M`, `K`, `L`**: 
   - If we set \( N = 1, M = 1, K = 1, L = 1 \), we already know Ivan has the only coin. The output should be `-1` since there are no new coins to gift.
  
   In this case:
   ```python
   # N = 1, M = 1, K = 1, L = 1
   min_x = (1 + 1 - 1) // 1 = 1
   M * min_x = 1 * 1 = 1
   N - K = 1 - 1 = 0
   # Here: 1 > 0 is False, so should print -1
   ```

2. **Case with impossible scenario**: 
   - Consider \( N = 10, M = 11, K = 0, L = 11 \):
     - Ivan has no coins, but his friends can't give him 11 different coins since there are only 10 available.
   
   In this case:
   ```python
   # N = 10, M = 11, K = 0, L = 11
   min_x = (11 + 11 - 1) // 11 = 1
   M * min_x = 11 * 1 = 11
   N - K = 10 - 0 = 10
   # 11 > 10 is True, so should print -1
   ```

3. **Edge case of all friends gifting zero new coins**: 
   - In a scenario \( N = 5, M = 5, K = 3, L = 3 \), the most that could fit would still reach a condition where new coins required cannot be satisfied.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis with various edge cases, we can see that the algorithm has the potential to produce incorrect results for specific scenarios. For instance:
- In the cases examined above, the checks might fail if there are discrepancies between gifted coins and available options, leading to wrong outputs compared to the specified conditions.

Therefore, when considering these flawed scenarios, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
