Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the stack is empty before a '-' operation correctly. According to the problem description, we must ensure that the pile is non-empty before each operation of taking a stone, which implies that Vasya must start with a sufficient number of stones to accommodate all '-' operations. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
---
```
In this case, the expected minimum starting number of stones would need to be at least 3 to accommodate the three '-' operations, resulting in 0 stones remaining. However, if Vasya started with fewer stones, the program does not prevent from subtracting too many stones. The logic in the program incorrectly allows the count of stones to go below 0 after the operations, which violates the problem constraints. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
