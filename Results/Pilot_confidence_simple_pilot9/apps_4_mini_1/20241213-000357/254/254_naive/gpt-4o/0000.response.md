Correctness: **False**.

The program checks whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three garland time intervals is equal to 1 to determine if it's possible to cover all seconds with at least one garland lit. However, this logic is flawed. The GCD being 1 does not guarantee that every second after the maximum starting time will be covered, as it only ensures that the cycles of the three garlands will eventually overlap at some point.

For example, consider the input `1 1 1`. In this case, the GCD is 1, and according to the program, it would print "YES". Yet, if we switch on all garlands at the same second (say at `x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 1`), they would be lit only at odd seconds (1, 3, 5,...). Thus, during seconds 2, 4, 6,... there would be no garland lit, which contradicts the requirement in the problem description that every second must have at least one garland lit.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the condition for all possible inputs, making it incorrect.
