To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, I will analyze the program logic.

**Program Analysis:**
1. The program first takes an input string `s` and strips any surrounding whitespace.
2. It checks if the length of `s` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it prints `0`, which is consistent with the requirement that single-character strings are palindromes.
3. It then checks if `s` itself is a palindrome using the helper function `func_1`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s`.
4. If `s` is a palindrome, the program checks if substring `s[1:]` (the entire string minus the first character) is a palindrome. If this substring is not a palindrome, the program prints `len(s) - 1`.
5. Next, it checks the substring `s[:-1]` (the entire string minus the last character). If this substring is also not a palindrome, it prints `len(s) - 1`.
6. If all possible substrings are palindromes, the program prints `0`. 

**Valid Cases:**
- For the input `mew`, it correctly detects that `mew` is not a palindrome and outputs `3`.
- For the input `wuffuw`, it correctly identifies `wuffuw` as a palindrome but finds that `wuffu` is not, outputting `5`.
- For the input `qqqqqqqq`, all substrings are palindromes, so it outputs `0`.

**Potential Issues:**
1. The program relies on checking only the full string and its substrings formed by removing the first or last character to find the longest non-palindrome substring. 
2. A critical oversight occurs when handling strings like "aaaab". If `s = "aaaab"`, the program will first determine this is not a palindrome, returning `5`, which is correct. However, for the string "aaaaa", the program fails to find the longer substring "aaaa" (from the second character on) which is a palindrome, yet there is a valid answer of `2` for substrings "aa".

3. The current checking does not account for non-palindromic substrings of maximal length formed from internal characters that do not sit at the start or end of the string.

### Conclusion:
While the program correctly identifies some cases of non-palindromic substrings and handles them correctly, it fundamentally lacks the logic to search for and return the longest non-palindromic substring if it exists in various configurations throughout the string. Therefore, there are cases (for instance "aaaaaa" or "aaaaa") where the program does not return the correct or expected result.

**Correctness: False**
