To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements of the problem and the provided code.

### Requirements from the Problem Description
1. We need to find the weights of all possible splits of a number `n`.
2. A split is defined as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum to `n`.
3. The weight of a split is defined as the count of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.
4. We need to return the number of different weights of the splits of `n`.

### Analysis of the Program
The provided function `func()` appears to be attempting to find the number of different weights by:
- Iterating through numbers from `1` to `âˆšn`.
- Counting how many times `n` can be evenly divided by `i`, which would give the number of different factors of `n`.

The logic of counting factors does not correlate to finding weights of splits directly:
- The first weight would be counted as a single element split (weight 1).
- Other weights correspond to repeated elements based on how many times they can be added together without exceeding `n`.

### Evaluation of Edge Cases
1. **Case n=1**:
   - Expected Output: 1 (One split: [1], weight is 1)
   - Program Output: `res = 0 + 1` (since it adds `2` to res for factors 1 and its own square root).
   - The output here would be `2`, which is incorrect as we only have one weight.

2. **Case n=2**:
   - Expected Output: 2 (Splits: [2], weight 1; [1, 1], weight 2)
   - Program Output: Would again miscount.

By investigating these cases, it becomes clear that the provided program does not accurately solve the problem as intended, because it mistakenly calculates counts based on factors instead of correctly generating and analyzing the splits.

### Conclusion
Given the discrepancies found in the analysis with sample cases, the program does not work correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
