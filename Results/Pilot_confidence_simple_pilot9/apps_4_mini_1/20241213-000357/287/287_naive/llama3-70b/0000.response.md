To analyze the given problem description and the provided program, let's break down what is needed.

The problem is asking for the number of different weights of the splits of a given integer \( n \). A weight is defined as the number of times the first element appears in a split.

Now, examining the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
    print(res)
```

### Code Analysis
1. **Variable Initialization**: The program initializes `res` to 0, which is intended to count the weights.
2. **Loop**: The loop iterates from 1 through the square root of \( n \) (inclusive). For each \( i \):
    - If \( n \) is divisible by \( i \), it increases `res` by 2 (presumably accounting for both \( i \) and \( n/i \)).
    - If \( i \) is the square root of \( n \), it decreases `res` by 1 (to correct for double-counting).
3. **Output**: Finally, it prints the result.

### Key Considerations:
The approach used here seems to be counting factors of \( n \) but does not directly relate to counting the different weights of valid splits of \( n \). As such, this logic does not consider how those weights are derived based on the criteria of valid splits (a nonincreasing sequence that sums to \( n \), starting with the greatest number).

### Finding an Issue:
Let's look at some examples to check the correctness:

1. **Case where \( n = 7 \)**:
    - The valid weights from previous examples:
        - Weight 1: \([7]\)
        - Weight 2: \([3, 3, 1]\)
        - Weight 3: \([2, 2, 2, 1]\)
        - Weight 7: \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
    - Therefore, there are 4 different weights. The expected output is 4.
  
2. **Case where \( n = 8 \)**:
    - The valid weights are anticipated to be:
        - Weight 1: \([8]\)
        - Weight 2: \([4, 4]\)
        - Weight 3: \([3, 3, 2]\)
        - Weight 4: \([2, 2, 2, 2]\)
        - Weight 5: \([2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
        - Weight 8: \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
    - Here, there are 5 different weights, which matches with the expected output.

3. **Case where \( n = 9 \)**:
    - The valid weights expected:
        - Weight 1: \([9]\)
        - Weight 3: \([3, 3, 3]\)
        - Weight 9: \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
    - Again, gives an expected output of 5.

For larger values of \( n \) (like \( n = 10 \), \( n = 11 \), etc.), the current implementation will not correctly represent different weights of valid splits; it is strictly counting divisors rather than tracking the corresponding weights of splits accurately.

### Conclusion:
The logic behind counting weights for valid splits does not appear in the provided program. Thus, since the program fails to meet the problem's requirements for correctly determining the number of different weights of splits, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly interprets the problem by counting factors of \( n \) instead of returning the counts of the distinct weights of the valid splits. For example, for \( n = 10 \), the expected output is different from what the program would provide, highlighting its inadequacy.
