The provided program aims to calculate the number of different weights of splits for the given integer `n`. However, upon examining the code, it becomes clear that it is incorrectly implemented for the problem statement.

The function `func_1` calculates the number of divisors of the input integer `num`, which does not correspond to the problem's requirement of finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`. This misunderstanding leads to a fundamental flaw in how the splits are counted.

For example, consider `n = 7`. The weights of splits should be derived from the various unique ways to split the number into nonincreasing sequences, but the function merely counts the divisors of `7`, which are `1` and `7` themselves, resulting in a count of `2`. According to the provided example, the output should be `4`, but this implementation does not cover the requirements at all.

To summarize, the program does not address the problem description correctly, and thus:

Correctness: **False**.
