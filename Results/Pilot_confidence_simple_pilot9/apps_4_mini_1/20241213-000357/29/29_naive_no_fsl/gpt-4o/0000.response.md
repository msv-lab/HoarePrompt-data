Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to correctly handle edge cases where files with names that coincide with their target names already exist. Specifically, the logic in the function `func_1` attempts to find the next available name for renaming files using `temp_counter`, and it tries to ensure that it doesn't collide with existing file names. However, the condition `while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:` does not guarantee that it will always successfully find an unused filename because if there are gaps in the existing names, it might skip over names without checking the conditions appropriately.

For example, consider the following input where there are multiple example and regular test files:

```
5
1 1
2 1
3 0
4 0
5 1
```

In this case, the expected output is:
```
5
move 1 1
move 2 2
move 5 3
move 3 4
move 4 5
```

However, the program likely fails to produce the correct moves as intended due to its flawed logic when determining the next available filename. Specifically, thereâ€™s a possibility that it would incorrectly handle checks for filenames already present, leading to incorrect moves or duplicate names. Thus, the program can produce results that do not follow the problem requirements.
