Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where files need to be moved to names that overlap or conflict with existing names. Specifically, in the second loop where the regular tests are renamed, it assigns a new name `i` (which is just the index) directly without consideration of existing names. This does not guarantee that the new name is unused (distinct). 

For example, if there are two regular files and both are being renamed in the second loop to the same name, it can cause a conflict and lead to incorrect overwriting of files. 

Suppose the input is:
```
4
a 0
b 1
c 0
d 1
```
The expected output should rename files like:
- Move `b` to `1`
- Move `d` to `2`
- Move `a` to `3`
- Move `c` to `4`

However, if the implementation does not keep track of previously renamed files correctly, there could be a scenario where it tries to rename a file to a name that has already been used, violating the distinct integers requirement. 

Thus, the requirement that all moved files have distinct names is not guaranteed, hence the program is incorrect.
