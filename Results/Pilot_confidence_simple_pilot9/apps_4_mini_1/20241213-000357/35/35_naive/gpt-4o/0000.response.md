To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to verify whether it correctly calculates the maximum possible integer \( x \) such that all \( n \) plates can contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake under the given conditions.

1. **Understanding the input**:
   - The input consists of three integers \( n \) (number of plates), \( a \) (pieces of the first cake), and \( b \) (pieces of the second cake).
   - The requirement is that each plate must contain at least one piece of cake, and no plate can contain pieces from both cakes.

2. **Functionality of `func_1`**:
   - The function uses a binary search approach between 1 and the minimum of \( a \) and \( b \) (plus one).
   - It calculates \( mid \) to check if distribution at that level is possible using the helper function `can_distribute`.

3. **Logic in `can_distribute` function**:
   - This function checks if the total number of pieces that can be allocated while ensuring each plate has at least \( x \) pieces is greater than or equal to \( n \). Specifically, it checks if \( a // x + b // x \geq n \).

4. **Potential edge cases**:
   - Given the constraints (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), we need to consider maximum values for \( a \) and \( b \) that could lead to edge scenarios.
   - The binary search approach employs integer division to evaluate possible distributions, so we need to ensure that the conditions sufficiently cover all possible distributions, particularly when \( n \) is equal to \( a + b \).

However, the main incorrect behavior appears when:

- If \( n \) exceeds the total number of pieces of either cake, for example, with inputs like \( (100, 1, 99) \), it should return 1 since all plates can only contain 1 piece but could lead to incorrect outputs due to assumptions made in the binary search if not properly handled at edge cases (such as when there are fewer pieces than the number of plates, resulting in the division leading to zero).

5. **Conclusion**:
The program has a potential problem with handling edge cases, particularly when it is at its limits of condition, leading to incorrect interpretations of distributions. 

Hence, the program does not correctly implement the distribution logic according to the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
