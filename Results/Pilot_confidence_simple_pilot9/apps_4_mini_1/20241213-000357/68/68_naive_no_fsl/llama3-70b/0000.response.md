To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description. 

The program aims to determine the voting outcome based on the number of confirmed upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and the uncertain votes (z). The program follows these steps:

1. If the number of upvotes (x) is greater than the total downvotes (y) plus the uncertain votes (z), it outputs "+".
2. If the number of upvotes (x) is less than the downvotes (y), it outputs "-".
3. If the number of upvotes (x) equals the number of downvotes (y):
   - If there are no uncertain votes (z = 0), it outputs "0".
   - If there are uncertain votes (z > 0), it outputs "?".
4. For all other cases, it outputs "?".

### Analysis of the Code

Let’s explore some potential cases and check the correctness:

1. **Input Example: `3 7 0`**
   - Upvotes = 3, Downvotes = 7, Uncertain = 0
   - There are definitely more downvotes than upvotes: Expected Output is '-' → Program outputs '-' (correct).

2. **Input Example: `2 0 1`**
   - Upvotes = 2, Downvotes = 0, Uncertain = 1
   - No matter how the uncertain vote goes, upvotes will always be more: Expected Output is '+' → Program outputs '+' (correct).

3. **Input Example: `1 1 0`**
   - Upvotes = 1, Downvotes = 1, Uncertain = 0
   - They are equal, and no uncertain votes: Expected Output is '0' → Program outputs '0' (correct).

4. **Input Example: `0 0 1`**
   - Upvotes = 0, Downvotes = 0, Uncertain = 1
   - The uncertain vote can either be up or down, leading to both '+' and '-' being possible: Expected Output is '?' → Program outputs '?' (correct).

5. **Input Example: `7 3 1`**
   - Upvotes = 7, Downvotes = 3, Uncertain = 1
   - Upvotes exceed downvotes + uncertain votes (3 + 1 = 4): Thus, the result is '+' → The program will output '+' (correct).

### Additional Edge Cases

- **Input: `5 5 1`**
   - Upvotes = 5, Downvotes = 5, Uncertain = 1
   - There are equal votes, but the uncertain vote could potentially alter the outcome. It could lead to '+' or '-', so the output should be '?'. However, the current program logic will not trigger the '?' in this scenario because `x > y + z` will not be satisfied → This is problematic. The current program will output '?' for this scenario.

Given the invalid logic for determining the output for certain conditions, the program does not account for cases where the votes are equal but uncertain votes exist, leading to multiple possible outcomes.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
