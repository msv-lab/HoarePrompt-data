To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the logic implemented in the `func` function and compare it against the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. The function reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing the number of people who will upvote, downvote, and the number of people with unknown voting intentions, respectively.
  
2. It defines:
   - `min_upvotes`: The minimum number of upvotes, which is equal to `x`.
   - `max_upvotes`: The maximum number of upvotes, calculated as `x + z`.
   - `min_downvotes`: The minimum number of downvotes, which is equal to `y`.
   - `max_downvotes`: The maximum number of downvotes, calculated as `y + z`.
  
3. It checks the following conditions:
   - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`: this means even in the best-case scenario for upvotes, downvotes will always be higher. Thus, it prints `'-'`.
   - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`: this means even in the best-case scenario for downvotes, upvotes will always be higher. Thus, it prints `'+'`.
   - If neither of the above conditions hold true, it prints `'?'`, indicating that there is uncertainty in the result due to the unknown votes.

### Examining Edge Cases:

1. **Case: (0, 0, 1)**:
   - Input: `0 0 1`
   - Minimum upvotes: `0`, Maximum upvotes: `1`
   - Minimum downvotes: `0`, Maximum downvotes: `1`
   - Neither condition (`max_upvotes < min_downvotes` or `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`) is satisfied, so it correctly prints `?`.
   
2. **Case: (0, 1, 1)**:
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Minimum upvotes: `0`, Maximum upvotes: `1`
   - Minimum downvotes: `1`, Maximum downvotes: `2`
   - Here, `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` holds true. So it should return `'-'`, which is correct.

3. **Case: (1, 1, 1)**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Minimum upvotes: `1`, Maximum upvotes: `2`
   - Minimum downvotes: `1`, Maximum downvotes: `2`
   - It will print `'?'`, which is the correct output as there is uncertainty in the votes.

4. **Case: (3, 7, 0)**:
   - Input: `3 7 0`
   - Minimum upvotes: `3`, Maximum upvotes: `3`
   - Minimum downvotes: `7`, Maximum downvotes: `7`
   - This correctly leads to `'-'` being printed.

5. **Case: (2, 0, 1)**:
   - Input: `2 0 1`
   - Minimum upvotes: `2`, Maximum upvotes: `3`
   - Minimum downvotes: `0`, Maximum downvotes: `1`
   - This leads to the correct output `'+'`.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing various test cases, I have not found any situations where the program does not behave as described in the problem statement. Every potential case has been accounted for correctly.

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**.
