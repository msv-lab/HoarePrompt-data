Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the number of years it will take for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads two integers, `a` (weight of Limak) and `b` (weight of Bob).
2. It initializes a variable `years` to count the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight.
3. It uses a `while` loop that continues as long as Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`. Within the loop:
   - Limak's weight `a` is tripled.
   - Bob's weight `b` is doubled.
   - The `years` counter is incremented by one.
4. Once Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight, the loop exits, and the program prints the total number of years.

The code adequately handles all edge cases described in the problem statement. For instance:

- If both weights are equal (as in the third example), Limak will immediately become heavier in the next calculation since he triples his weight while Bob only doubles his, leading to a correct output.
- The loop structure guarantees that the program will not exit until Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's, fulfilling the requirement stated in the problem description.

After considering various potential input scenarios, there are no cases where Limak does not exceed Bob's weight according to the rules established. Therefore, the program works as intended for the given constraints.

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
