Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem requirements for multiple cases. Specifically, while it correctly handles the input case of `n = 2` by returning "NO," it fails for values of `n` greater than 3. The fractions presented (`1, n // 2` and `1, n`) are incorrect. 

For instance, if `n` is `4`, the program outputs:
```
YES
2
1 2
1 4
```
This indicates fractions of `1/2` and `1/4`, which sum to `1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4`. However, the problem states that the fractions must sum to `1 - 1/n = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4`, and therefore, this specific case of `n = 4` does not satisfy the requirement.

Additionally, for values like `n = 5`, the output would give `1/2` and `1/5`, which will not satisfy the sum condition either.

Thus, since the code does not correctly generate a valid sequence of fractions for all values of `n > 2`, it fails to meet the problem's requirements.
