Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations such that \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \) for all possible values of \( n \). 

1. The function `func_1(n - 1, MOD)` is called for \( n \geq 3 \). However, this function only calculates the factorial of \( n-1 \) and doesn't take into account the correct logic to determine \( f(p) \) for the specified permutations.
   
2. The calculation logic for \( f_{max}(n) \) is missing, and the frequency of permutations giving \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \) is incorrectly derived by simply computing a factorial. Thus, for values of \( n \) greater than 3, the provided logic will not yield the correct output.

For instance, if we consider \( n=3 \), based on the problem description, the maximum value of \( f(p) \) is \( 2 \), and the program returns \( 2! = 2 \) which is incorrect, as there are \( 4 \) permutations with \( f(p) = 2 \).

Therefore, the program does not address the problem's requirements accurately for all potential cases of \( n \), leading to incorrect outputs for higher values of \( n \).
