To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's break down both the problem and the provided code.

**Problem Understanding:**
1. We are given a function \( f(p) \) defined over the permutations of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
2. The \( g_i \) is the GCD of the prefix of length \( i \) of permutation \( p \).
3. The goal is to find \( f_{max}(n) \), which is the maximum distinct values of \( g_i \) over all permutations.
4. For the input \( n \), we need to count the permutations where \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \).

**Analysis of the Code:**
- The code first checks if \( n == 2 \). If true, it directly returns 1, which seems correct since the only permutation of [1, 2] gives \( f(p) = 1 \).
- For \( n > 2 \), it calls `func_1(n - 1, MOD)`. This function computes the factorial of \( n-1 \):
  ```python
  def func_1(n, mod):
      result = 1
      for i in range(2, n + 1):
          result = result * i % mod
      return result
  ```
- This means for \( n = 3 \), `func_1(2, MOD)` computes \( 2! = 2 \), and `result` in this case would be 2.
- However, if we closely match this against our needs for different \( n \), it appears that the logic of determining \( f_{max}(n) \) and counting the corresponding permutations is oversimplified.

**Critical Test Cases:**
Let's analyze a few critical values:
- **When \( n = 3 \)**: From the description and the given example, \( f_{max}(3) = 2 \) and the permutations yielding this are \([2, 1, 3]\), \([2, 3, 1]\), \([3, 1, 2]\), and \([3, 2, 1]\). The code calculates \( 2! = 2 \), meaning it fails to count the actual \( 4 \) permutations.
- **When \( n = 4 \)** and beyond, similar discrepancies arise where the correct permutations counted do not match the logic of simply computing the factorial.

Thus, the code overlooks permutations that yield values of \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \) for various configurations.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not properly compute the permutations and corresponding \( f(p) \) values, specifically failing to adhere to the problem description for inputs greater than 2. 

Correctness: **False**.
