To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic in the implementation:

The task is to determine the minimum number of digits to remove from an integer `n` so that the resulting number is divisible by \(10^k\). This requires finding at least \(k\) zeros in the number, and any non-zero digits before these zeros need to be counted for removal.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)
```

### Examination of Logic

1. **Count Zeros**: The loop iterates through the digits in reverse order. It starts counting zeros. This is correct for ensuring we gather zeros from the end (which contribute to divisibility by powers of ten).

2. **Non-Zero Digits Counting**: For every non-zero digit encountered, it increases the `to_remove` count. This part correctly identifies the digits that must be removed until enough zeros are found.

3. **Break Condition**: When it has found \(k\) zeros, it stops processing further, which is efficient and correct.

4. **Final Check**: If \(k\) zeros have been found, it prints the count of digits to remove. If not enough zeros were found, it defaults to removing \(len(n) - 1\) digits. 

### Potential Issues:
- Consider the edge case where \(n\) consists of only non-zero digits (e.g., `111` and \(k=2\)). In this case, the program still outputs `2` (removing all but one digit), which does not address the actual requirement of removing necessitated digits for forming a number divisible by \(10^2\). The output in such cases could lead to misunderstandings about what constitutes valid removal since the end result can't be made valid due to lack of zeros.
  
- Another problematic scenario arises if \(n\) is exactly `0` and \(k\) is any value greater than or equal to 1. The output may not handle this special case consistently.

Given the potential missing edge case handling, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements in all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation:
The program does not handle edge cases properly, particularly when \(n\) lacks sufficient zeros, or when \(n\) contains no digits that allow for forming a number divisible by \(10^k\). Thus, the conditions set out in the problem description are not fulfilled in every potential input case.
