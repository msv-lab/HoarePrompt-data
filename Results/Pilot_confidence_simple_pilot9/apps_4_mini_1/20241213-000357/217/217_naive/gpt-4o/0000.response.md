Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible value of \( B - C \) based on the problem description. 

Explanation: 
- It partitions the sequence into two parts: one where the elements are greater than zero (`b`), and the other where the elements are less than zero (`c`). 
- By summing the positive integers into \( B \) and the negative integers into \( C \), it effectively maximizes \( B - C \) since negative contributions from \( C \) are subtracted when calculating the result.
- The program handles both the cases of including positive numbers and excluding all negative numbers correctly as per the examples provided in the problem description, and it correctly computes the result for sequences with 1 to 100 integers in the specified range.

No edge cases or scenarios contradict the given problem statement, ensuring correctness across all potential input cases.
