To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the functionality of the code in relation to the problem description.

The problem requires us to determine the number of positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial of \( n \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. The function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) by counting the number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \( n \). 

The function `func_2(m)` then performs a binary search to find all \( n \) values where \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes:

1. The search bounds are appropriately chosen as a range from 0 to \( 5 \times (m + 1) \), which is a reasonable upper limit since trailing zeroes increase with \( n \).
2. If the number of trailing zeroes from `func_1(mid)` is less than \( m \), it adjusts the lower bound (`low`). If it's more, it adjusts the upper bound (`high`), which is correct for binary search logic.
3. If it finds an exact match, it correctly expands outwards to gather all valid integers \( n \) that yield exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes in \( n! \).

However, it's important to check for:

- Edge cases where the number of trailing zeroes might not exist for certain values of \( m \). For instance, for \( m = 5 \), as shown in the given example, the output is 0 because there are no integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly 5 zeroes.
- The program may also fail to find any values for \( m \) that are not achievable within the defined range due to a condition in which \( n \) just doesn't produce the required number of trailing zeroes.

Considering this, let’s validate by checking cases. 

1. For \( m = 0 \):
   - The correct output should be 0 because no positive integer's factorial has exactly zero trailing zeroes.
  
2. For \( m = 1 \):
   - Valid outputs should be \( 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \), which is correctly handled by the program.

3. For \( m = 6 \):
   - The output should be \( 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 \).

But if we check \( m = 5 \), indeed the program states it returns 0, which might be misleading. 

Checking edge cases where \( m \) is large, such as \( m = 100000 \):
- It should correctly compute the upper bounds and might return either a large range or still be 0 depending on the number of trailing zeroes that can realistically exist.

Based on careful observation, the code logic appears sound, but theoretically does miss out on producing zero if the value can't be achieved inside the \( n \) factorial equation.

Thus, we find that this can lead to instances where the values aren’t collected properly.

Therefore:
Correctness: **False**.
Specifically, it does not correctly handle the detection and return of scenarios like \( m = 0 \) that should return 0 as well.
