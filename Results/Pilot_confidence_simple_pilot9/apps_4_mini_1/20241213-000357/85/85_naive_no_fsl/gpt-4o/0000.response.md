To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code in relation to the problem description and the provided examples.

The program attempts to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. It uses the following logic:

1. It calculates the maximum number of trailing nines in the total cost that can be achieved by repeatedly dividing the input `n` by 10 until it's no longer divisible by 10. This counts how many times `n + 1` is a multiple of 10.
2. It then calculates the total number of pairs by using the formula `(n + 1) * max_9s`, which is unclear with respect to the problem statement.

Let's evaluate given examples and their expected outputs:

1. **Input: 7**
    - Expected Output: 3 (pairs are (2,7), (3,6), (4,5))
    - According to the program, after running its logic, the calculation for pairs seems incorrect.

2. **Input: 14**
    - Expected Output: 9 (pairs are (1,8), (2,7), ..., (9,10))
    - Again, the logic for calculating pairs does not match expected outputs.

3. **Input: 50**
    - Expected Output: 1 (only (49,50) form 99)
    - The logic will not return the expected value based on the given approach.

We can identify that the program exhibits flawed logic when it shifts focus to simply multiply `max_9s` with `n + 1` without a proper foundation for calculating the unique pairs of shovels.

Additionally, let's consider the edge case:
- For the input **n = 2**, the expected output should be 0 because no pairs exist that can lead to a trailing nine, and the code does not handle that case correctly.

Given these observations, the program does not function as intended across the required use cases and is flawed in its calculation of the total pairs of shovels.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
