To verify the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze it against various potential inputs based on the conditions laid out in the problem.

### Analysis of the code:
The function `func_1(n)` counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that:
1. It is possible to form a rectangle but not a square.
2. Each part has a positive integer length and their total equals `n`.

1. **Initialization**: It starts by checking if `n < 6`. If so, it returns 0 immediately since it's impossible to make four positive integer parts that sum to less than 6.
2. **Loop from 1 up to n // 4**: The idea is to loop through possible lengths `a` of the two equal parts of the rectangle. 
3. **Condition for the remainder**: It calculates `rem` as the leftover length after taking into account the two equal parts of length `a` and `b` (which is also set equal to `a`). If `rem > 0` and is even, it checks if `a != rem // 2` to ensure that the parts do not all end up being the same length (which would form a square).

### Scenarios where this code could be incorrect:
1. **Boundary Cases**: Let's consider the edge case where `n = 6`:
   - The only valid partition is {1, 1, 2, 2}, which does result in a rectangle but not a square. This should return 1.
  
2. **Large Values**: We need to validate against larger values of `n` to ensure it behaves consistently. For instance:
   - Suppose `n = 10`, valid partitions could be {1, 1, 4, 4} and {2, 2, 3, 3}. The expected number should be 2.
  
3. **Evenness Check**: For values like `n = 8`, the function should find:
   - Partitions like {1, 1, 3, 3}, validating presence of valid configurations.

### Test Cases:
If we analyze the case `n = 7`:
- The partitions would need to adhere to the parts summing to 7 while ensuring none can be square; however, as per logic:
   - The only possibilities would eventually lead to {1, 1, 2, 2} and fail to produce additional valid rectangles, leading us to believe the addition to not count correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program logic misses edge cases where values could, despite conditions set, yield incorrect outputs based on derived conditions for valid sets, especially when found numbers do implement constructions incorrectly.

Thus, considering even a simple input/output that does not yield expected results gives enough foundation to assert an incorrect status.

Correctness: **False**.
