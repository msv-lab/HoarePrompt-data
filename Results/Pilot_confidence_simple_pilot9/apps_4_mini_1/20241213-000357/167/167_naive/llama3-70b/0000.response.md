Correctness: **False**.

The given program fails to handle a case where the path provided consists of movements that are not adjacent in the conceptual matrix defined by the problem description. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 4 2 5
```
In this case, starting from cell containing 1 (which would be at (1, 1) in a matrix) to 4 (which would be at (2, 1) if we assume a typical row-major order), then moving to 2 (which is at (1, 2)) is not a valid move as it is not adjacent either in row or column as specified by the problem. This would make the required path impossible given the constraints. However, the program may incorrectly conclude that a valid matrix configuration can be established, as it does not verify the adjacencies properly for the entire path in the `func_1` function.

Therefore, while it may output "YES" for certain cases, the program does not hold for every possible case of movement on the matrix, hence it is incorrect.
