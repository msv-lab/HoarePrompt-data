To verify the correctness of the given program against the stated problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_2(m, a, b)` and how it computes the value of \( f(i) \) for integers \( i \) from \( 0 \) to \( m \).

1. The function begins by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( a \) and \( b \) using `func_1`. If the GCD is greater than 1, it divides \( m, a, \) and \( b \) by the GCD and multiples the result by the GCD, effectively scaling down the problem. This is valid because if \( a \) and \( b \) have a common divisor, they can only reach positions that are multiples of that divisor.

2. In the next stage, it sets \( k = a + b - 1 \) and checks:
   - If \( m < k \), it calculates the sum of the first \( m \) numbers plus one (for reachable integers up to \( m \)), which seems to be a valid assessment of reachable numbers in that range. The formula \( (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2 \) corresponds to the sum of the first \( m + 1 \) integers.
   - If \( m \geq k \), the program computes two sums: one for the first \( k \) integers and another for the integers between \( k \) and \( m \). This seems reasonable since if \( m \) is greater than or equal to \( k \), it accounts for all positions that can be reached within \( m \).

### Check for Edge Cases:
Let's consider a potential edge case:
- Input scenario where \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 1 \) with \( m = 10 \):
  - \( f(i) \) should return \( i + 1 \) for \( i \) in \( [0, 10] \), meaning the sum \( f(0) + f(1) + \ldots + f(10) = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 11 = 66 \).
  - The GCD is 1, thus it proceeds to the computation block. It will fall into the second case (\( m \geq k \)) since \( k = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1 \).
  - The sum computed by the program: \( sum_k = 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 + 10 * (10 + 1) // 2 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 = 1 + 55 = 56 \). This is incorrect since the expected value is 66.

Upon this inspection, we observe that the program does not accurately handle the calculation of \( \sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) \) for certain values of \( a \) and \( b \), specifically in cases where they can jump to every successive number, as seen in the example.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program fails to compute the correct sum of reachable positions for specific edge cases like \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 1 \) for \( m = 10 \) (it results in 56 rather than 66). Therefore, it does not adhere to the full problem description across potential inputs.
