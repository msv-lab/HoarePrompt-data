To determine the correctness of the given program, we analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1(n)`.

The problem describes how Sofia will draw squares on a plane and how to minimize the number of segments she needs to draw with a ruler without guidance. According to the analysis:

1. The number of squares \( n \) can be represented by arranging them in a rectangular grid of \( a \times b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) must satisfy \( a \cdot b \geq n \).
2. The segments needed for \( a \) vertical lines and \( b \) horizontal lines can be calculated as \( 2 \cdot (a + b) \).
3. The goal is to minimize \( segments\_needed \) by iterating through possible values of \( a \).

**Now, let's find an edge case or check if the logic holds correctly.**

Let's consider \( n = 5 \):
- The valid configurations for \( a \) and \( b \) are:
    - \( a = 1, b = 5 \) -> segments needed = \( 2 \cdot (1+5) = 12 \)
    - \( a = 2, b = 3 \) -> segments needed = \( 2 \cdot (2+3) = 10 \)
    - \( a = 3, b = 2 \) -> segments needed = \( 2 \cdot (3+2) = 10 \)
    - \( a = 5, b = 1 \) -> segments needed = \( 12 \)
  
The minimum segments needed would then be \( \text{min}(12, 10, 10, 12) = 10 \), but we didn't ensure that \( a \times b \) satisfies \( n \) exactly.

Another test case can be for \( n = 8 \):
- The valid configurations for \( a \) and \( b \) are:
    - \( a = 1, b = 8 \) -> segments needed = \( 18 \)
    - \( a = 2, b = 4 \) -> segments needed = \( 12 \)
    - \( a = 4, b = 2 \) -> segments needed = \( 12 \)
    - \( a = 8, b = 1 \) -> segments needed = \( 18 \)

The minimum segments needed would be \( \text{min}(18, 12, 12, 18) = 12 \), indicating that the function can miss optimal configurations.

This already indicates there is a flaw in the program. The calculation of segments needed might not account for configurations that efficiently transfer segments drawn from fewer squares. 

Upon even further inspection based on the range of \( n \) (up to \( 10^9 \)), the logic of searching through only \( a \) values (1 to \( \sqrt{n} \)) may omit potential combinations that lead to fewer drawn segments. Consequently, this leads to incorrect outputs for various inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

Example case: For \( n = 5 \), the program will not provide the minimum segment count correctly as it fails to handle all possibilities of rectangles formed by \( a \) and \( b \) combinations and misses configurations where fewer segments can indeed be drawn effectively.
