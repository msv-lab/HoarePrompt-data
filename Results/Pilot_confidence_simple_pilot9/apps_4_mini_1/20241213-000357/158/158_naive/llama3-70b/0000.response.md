To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's examine the requirements and logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Requirements:
Nikolay has lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). The ratio of fruits for the compote is:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

From these requirements, for each lemon, he needs two apples and four pears. The output should be the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to create the compote, which can be represented as:
- Total = lemons + apples + pears = `min_lemon + (min_lemon * 2) + (min_lemon * 4)`

### Program Logic:
1. The program takes three integers as inputs:
   - `a` (lemons)
   - `b` (apples)
   - `c` (pears)

2. It calculates `min_lemon` by taking the minimum of:
   - `a` (lemons)
   - `b // 2` (to ensure enough apples for the lemons)
   - `c // 4` (to ensure enough pears for the lemons)

3. It computes the total number of fruits used as:
   ```python
   print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
   ```

### Checking for Edge Cases:
1. Consider the case where Nikolay has 0 lemons, 0 apples, and 0 pears (Though specified `1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000`, this serves as a boundary to consider). The correct output should be 0 in this circumstance.
2. Checking the provided examples:
   - For input `2`, `5`, `7`; `min_lemon` would be `1` resulting in `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` (Correct).
   - For input `4`, `7`, `13`; `min_lemon` would be `3` resulting in `3 + 6 + 12 = 21` (Correct).
   - For input `2`, `3`, `2`; Since `c` is less than required for at least 1 lemon (2 pears needed, but only 2 available). `min_lemon` would be `0`, which would result in `0` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the problem description alongside the provided program, it handles the requirements well without leaving any edge cases unaddressed within the constraints of the problem. Given the range of inputs specified (from 1 to 1000 for `a`, `b`, and `c`), the logic correctly determines the maximum number of fruits used in the compote according to the specified ratio.

Correctness: **True**.
