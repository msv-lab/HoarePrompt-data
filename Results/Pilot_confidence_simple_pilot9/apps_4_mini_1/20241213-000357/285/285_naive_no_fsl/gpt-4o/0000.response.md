Correctness: **True**

The program effectively checks if a specific amount of game-coins can be exactly spent on houses, cars, and computers as described in the problem statement. It achieves this through a nested loop approach.

1. It iterates through possible quantities of houses (`a`), which have a cost of 1,234,567 game-coins.
2. For each combination of houses, it calculates the remaining coins and then iterates through possible quantities of cars (`b`), which cost 123,456 game-coins.
3. After subtracting the cost of houses and cars from the total, it checks if the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of computers (1,234 game-coins).

This approach ensures that all combinations of houses and cars are explored while checking each resultant remaining balance for divisibility by the cost of computers.

I considered edge cases, including values where `n` is exactly the cost of a house, a car, or only computers, and the program correctly handles those situations by returning "YES". Additionally, it accurately returns "NO" when it is impossible to achieve `n` using the given costs.

No potential failing cases were identified, confirming that the program works as intended for the entire specified range of inputs. Thus, the program correctly implements the logic required to meet the problem description.
