You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
from collections import deque

bessie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
elsie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
bessie_start = func_1(bessie_puzzle)
elsie_start = func_1(elsie_puzzle)
bessie_reachable = func_2(bessie_start)
elsie_reachable = func_2(elsie_start)
if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]

def func_2(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        (empty_row, empty_col) = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        for (dr, dc) in directions:
            (new_row, new_col) = (empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc)
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                (new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos]) = (new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos])
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
    return visited


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
