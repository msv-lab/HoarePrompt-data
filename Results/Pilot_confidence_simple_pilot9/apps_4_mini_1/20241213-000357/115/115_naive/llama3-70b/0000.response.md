To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description regarding transforming matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) using operations on \( B \), we need to analyze the logic and potential edge cases of the code.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Definitions**: The program reads the dimensions of a matrix and the values for matrix \( A \). It initializes an empty list for operations that will transform matrix \( B \).
  
2. **Loop Structure**: The program iterates over the elements of matrix \( A \) (ignoring the last row and last column) to check whether a \( 2 \times 2 \) block can be formed starting from the element \( A[i][j] \).

3. **Conditions**: The checks (`if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)`) confirm if a \( 2 \times 2 \) block of \( 1s \) is present. It does this to avoid making unnecessary operations. 

4. **Operation Addition**: For any case where one of the surrounding values is \( 1 \), an operation is registered by appending the coordinates to the `ops` list.

5. **Output**: At the end, the code checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500, printing `-1` if it does. Otherwise, it prints the length of the operations and the operations themselves.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Incomplete Handling of Matrix \( A \)**: The program only adds operations if it sees a potential \( 1 \) in the surrounding submatrices. The check fails to appropriately mark non-constructible areas or those with isolated \( 1s \). If a `1` is present but cannot be part of any \( 2 \times 2 \) block due to being isolated, it won't be handled.

2. **Inability to Form \( B \)**: For example, consider the following input:
    ```
    3 3
    1 0 0
    1 0 0
    0 0 0
    ```
   Here, there are two isolated 1s, and the program does not operate to construct any \( 1s \) in \( B \), hence it will return the count of operations as `0`, which suggests it's impossible, but doesn't indicate that making \( B \) equal to \( A \) in any form was impossible, missing to accurately reflect that situation.

3. **Missing Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle cases where there is a required \( 1 \) without a surrounding \( 2 \times 2 \) structure well.

Based on the points mentioned above, specifically point 2, there exist configurations where either `1s` cannot be grouped into any \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix and therefore it cannot create the desired output \( B \).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because there are cases such as the one described that it does not handle correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
