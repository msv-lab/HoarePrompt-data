Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error that potentially leads to incorrect results based on the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle cases where the entire array can be split as required, but it fails to check all subarrays based on their sums.

Here are potential issues in the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Subarrays**: The condition `if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` is checking that the current prefix sum is not zero and also not equal to the total sum. However, the way the splitting logic is structured may result in some viable subarrays being ignored if there are more complex distributions of positive and negative sums, particularly when there are zeros in the array.

2. **For an input like** `4`, `1 1 -2 0`, the program calculates the prefix sums as:
   - `0 (initial)`
   - `1`
   - `2`
   - `0`
   - `0 (final)` 

   It starts checking prefix sums earlier without checking every possible segment. This can result in declaring No when a valid non-zero segmented splitting exists.

3. The program should ideally be checking if every possible combination results in subarrays that do not sum up to zero, which it does not do effectively.

Due to these issues, the program does not satisfy the problem description and can produce incorrect outputs for specific test cases. Thus, it is deemed incorrect.
