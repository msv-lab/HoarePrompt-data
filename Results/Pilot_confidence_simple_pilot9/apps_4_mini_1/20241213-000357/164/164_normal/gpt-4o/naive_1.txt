Now let's consider potential edge cases:
- If 'G' is immediately next to 'T' and k = 1, it should return "YES".
- If 'G' is two cells away from 'T' with k = 2, it should return "YES", provided there's no obstacle.
- If 'G' and 'T' are separated such that total distance is not a multiple of k (e.g., G is at position 0 and T at position 2 with k = 2), it should return "NO" since the grasshopper can't land exactly on T.

One crucial test case not handled is:
- If 'G' and 'T' are separated such that there exists an obstacle at each potential jump position that the grasshopper would try to land on.

For example:
Input:
```
8 2
G.#..#T.
```
Expected output is "NO" since G can't reach T without landing on obstacles.

However, the current implementation correctly identifies such cases because it breaks the loop on the first '#' it encounters and only checks within the range of possible jumps. 

Thus, all edge cases are satisfactorily addressed by the provided implementation. The indicated behavior aligns with the expected handling of the problem.
