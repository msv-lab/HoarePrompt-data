Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input integer contains the digit '0'. According to the problem description, the frequency of each digit should not exceed the digit itself. Since '0' cannot appear at all (its count cannot be greater than zero), the program fails when a number has digit '0' appearing in it. 

For example, consider the input `120`. The frequency of the digit '1' is 1 (which is fine), but the digit '0' appears once, which is not allowed since the digit itself is '0' (and thus should not appear at all). The program would return `True`, which is incorrect. 

Thus, since there are cases where the function does not meet the required logic, the correctness is **False**.
