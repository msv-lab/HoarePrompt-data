Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle a case where the input number contains the digit '0'. For example, if we input `100` into the function:

1. The digit '1' appears once, which is acceptable since `1 >= 1`.
2. The digit '0' appears twice, but since `2 > 0`, the function should return `False` because the frequency of '0' exceeds the digit itself.

Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the logic as stated in the problem description for all potential cases.
