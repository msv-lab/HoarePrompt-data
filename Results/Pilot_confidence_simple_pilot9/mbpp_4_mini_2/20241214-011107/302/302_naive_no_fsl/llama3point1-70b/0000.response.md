Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a specified number in a sorted array. The implementation uses a simple loop that checks each element of the array against the target number. If it finds a match, it returns the index; if no match is found after checking all elements, it returns -1.

Since the input array is sorted, the function adheres to the problem statement's conditions by correctly returning the index of the first occurrence. For example:

- If `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 2`, the function returns `1`, which is the correct index of the first occurrence of `2`.
- If `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 5`, the function correctly returns `-1`, indicating that `5` is not present in the array.

The function handles all edge cases, such as empty arrays and numbers not present in the array, properly according to the requirements. Thus, the program meets the specifications of the problem description.
