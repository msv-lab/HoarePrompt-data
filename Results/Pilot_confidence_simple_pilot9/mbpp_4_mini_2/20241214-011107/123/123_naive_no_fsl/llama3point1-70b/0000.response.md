To verify the correctness of the given program, we can analyze the function `func_1(lst, L)` based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Description:
The function must take in a list and an integer L, and split the list into two parts. The first part should have a length of L, and the function should return both parts in a tuple.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Types**: The function is designed to accept a list (`lst`) and an integer (`L`). This is in line with the description.
  
2. **Splitting Logic**: The function uses slicing to create two parts:
   - `lst[:L]` gives the first part with the first L elements of the list.
   - `lst[L:]` gives the second part starting from index L to the end of the list.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `L` is 0, the function returns an empty list as the first part and the whole list as the second part.
   - If `L` is greater than the length of the list, the first part returns the entire list and the second part returns an empty list.
   - If `L` is negative, Python's slicing behavior will handle it gracefully, returning empty parts appropriately.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider some test cases to confirm the behavior:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)` should return `([1, 2], [3, 4, 5])`.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0)` should return `([], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`.
3. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5)` should return `([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [])`.
4. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 10)` should return `([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [])`.
5. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], -1)` should return `([], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`.

All of the above cases behave as expected without any issues.

Since the program seems to handle all potential edge cases correctly and fulfills the problem requirements, we conclude the following:

Correctness: **True**
