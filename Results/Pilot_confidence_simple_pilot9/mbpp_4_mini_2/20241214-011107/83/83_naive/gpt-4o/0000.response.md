To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step according to the given problem description: "Write a function to sort a list of elements."

1. **Understanding the program**: The program attempts to sort an array using a combination of a `flip` method and finding the maximum element's index (`find_max_index`). This approach seems to be implementing a sorting algorithm similar to pancake sorting.

2. **Identifying potential issues**:
   - The implementation of the `find_max_index` function is incorrect because it references `arr`, which is not defined in its scope. This will cause a `NameError` when invoked.
   - Even if `find_max_index` were to access the correct array reference, the logic could still potentially fail for certain edge cases, such as input lists containing negative numbers, floats, or empty lists.

3. **Testing for edge cases**:
   - For an empty list, `func_1([])` should return `[]`, but the logic does not handle this case.
   - For a list with negative numbers or floats, the sorting logic could lead to unexpected results if not implemented correctly due to relying on how indices are managed in a flip operation.

Given these problems:
- The program will fail to compile due to the undefined variable `arr`.
- Even if the variable issue were resolved, the general sort logic does not seem robust to handle all potential cases.

Thus, I conclude:
Correctness: **False**.
