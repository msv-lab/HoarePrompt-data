Correctness: **True**.

The provided function takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and correctly subtracts the elements of `tup2` from the corresponding elements in `tup1` using the `zip` function. This will work for tuples of the same length as intended in the problem description.

Additionally, if the tuples are of different lengths, `zip` will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, which is a reasonable choice for this context and aligns with how Python handles iterable pairs.

In all potential cases, including cases where the tuples might be empty or have varying lengths, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, it is concluded that the implementation is correct.
