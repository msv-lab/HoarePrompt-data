Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as input, and successfully concatenates the tuple (converted to a list) to the existing list. The assertions provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given examples. 

The program correctly handles the addition of the tuple elements to the list for various input scenarios provided in the assertions, which indicate that it effectively meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Since I cannot think of any edge cases or examples where the function would perform incorrectly, the program is considered correct.
