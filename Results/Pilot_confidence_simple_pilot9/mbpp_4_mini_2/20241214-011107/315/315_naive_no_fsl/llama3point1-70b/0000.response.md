Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(input_list, input_tuple)` correctly meets the problem description of adding the elements of the given tuple to the given list. 

1. It takes two inputs: a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`).
2. It converts the tuple into a list using `list(input_tuple)`.
3. It concatenates the original list with the newly created list from the tuple using the `+` operator.
4. The resulting combined list is returned.

The function effectively handles various cases, including:
- An empty list and an empty tuple.
- A non-empty list and an empty tuple.
- An empty list and a non-empty tuple.
- Both the list and tuple being non-empty.

For example:
- `func_1([], ())` returns `[]`, which is correct.
- `func_1([1, 2], ())` returns `[1, 2]`, which is correct.
- `func_1([], (3, 4))` returns `[3, 4]`, which is correct.
- `func_1([1, 2], (3, 4))` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is correct.

There are no edge cases or potential issues with the logic of this function that would prevent it from fulfilling the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct in all potential cases.
