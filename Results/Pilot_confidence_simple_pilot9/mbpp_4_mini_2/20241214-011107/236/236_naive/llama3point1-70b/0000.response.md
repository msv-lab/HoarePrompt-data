Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(nums)` accurately checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted. It compares the original list with a newly sorted version of the list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. 

In all cases:

1. If the list is empty or contains one element, it is inherently sorted, and both the original and sorted versions will be the same, returning `True`.
2. For a list with multiple elements, such as `[1, 2, 3]`, it would equal its sorted version, thus returning `True`. Conversely, for a list like `[3, 1, 2]`, the sorted version would be different, resulting in `False`.
3. The function successfully handles negative numbers and mixed types (as long as they are comparable) as determined by the Python sorting rules.

Overall, this implementation correctly fulfills the problem requirements for all potential cases.
