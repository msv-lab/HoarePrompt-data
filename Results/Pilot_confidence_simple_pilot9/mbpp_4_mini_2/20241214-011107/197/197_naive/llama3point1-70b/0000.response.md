To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1`.

The problem states:
- Write a Python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple.

The given program is:
```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))
```

### Analysis:

1. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The function `tup.count(element)` counts how many times `element` appears in `tup`.
   - The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `lst`, counting its occurrences in `tup`, and then sums these counts.

2. **Input Types**:
   - The function assumes `tup` is a tuple and `lst` is a list, which is in accordance with the problem description. However, there is no type checking or handling for cases where inputs are of incorrect types.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If `tup` is empty, the program should return `0`, which it does correctly because `count` will return `0` for every element in `lst`.
   - If `lst` is empty, the program should also return `0`, which it does correctly, as there are no elements to count in the tuple.
   - If `tup` contains elements that are not in `lst`, those counts would simply not contribute to the sum, which is also handled correctly.
   - The program does not address what happens if invalid types are passed (e.g., if `tup` is a list instead of a tuple, or `lst` is a string).

4. **Conclusion about Correctness**:
   - The function works correctly to count occurrences as described and handles many edge cases properly. However, it lacks input validation and does not handle unexpected types which could lead to runtime errors.

Given that we have identified that while the function works for the described task, it does not handle cases of incorrect input types, we conclude that the program is not correct based on the strict requirements of the task, as it must work in every potential case.

Thus, the final evaluation is:

Correctness: **False**.
