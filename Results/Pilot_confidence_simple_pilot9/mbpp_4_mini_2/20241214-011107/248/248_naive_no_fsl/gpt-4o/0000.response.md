Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing the same elements in the same order. 

The assertions provided also test the function with different lists, and all tests return the expected tuple outputs. 

Additionally, the function should handle various cases well, including:
- An empty list should return an empty tuple: `func_1([])` would return `()`.
- A list with different data types, e.g., `func_1([1, 'a', None])` would return `(1, 'a', None)`.

Since there are no potential cases found where the function fails to meet the problem requirements, the implementation is correct.
