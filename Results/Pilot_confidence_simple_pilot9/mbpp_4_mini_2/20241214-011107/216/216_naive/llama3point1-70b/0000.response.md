To determine if the provided program meets the problem description, let's analyze both the description and the implementation.

**Problem description**: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Sorting**: The list is sorted to evaluate whether the numbers in it are consecutive.
2. **Checking Consecutiveness**: The function checks if every subsequent number is exactly one greater than the previous number using a generator expression.
3. **Handling Duplicates**: It checks that the list does not contain duplicates by comparing the length of the list with the length of the set of the list.

### Potential Flaw:
- The code only considers positive increments of one for checking consecutiveness. It does not handle scenarios where there are negative numbers or zero. For example:
  - Input: `lst = [3, 4, 2, 1]` would return `True` (which is correct).
  - Input: `lst = [0, 1, 2]` would return `True`, which is also correct.
  - **However**, an input like `lst = [1, 2, 4]` would return `False`, which is correct.
  - But if the input contains negative numbers, such as `lst = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]`, it would also return `True` (which may not be the intended behavior if considering only positive consecutive numbers).

### Conclusion:
The program does not explicitly check if the numbers are strictly consecutive across any range (including both negative and positive), nor does it validate mixed signed inputs. 

Thus, we can state that:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not account for all potential edge cases where the criteria for "consecutive numbers" may vary, particularly when including negative numbers or zero into the definition of consecutiveness.
