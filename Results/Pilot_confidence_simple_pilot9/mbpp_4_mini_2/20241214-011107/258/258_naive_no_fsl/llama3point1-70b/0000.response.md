To determine whether the provided program correctly identifies whether a given number is an Armstrong number, let's first clarify what an Armstrong number is. An Armstrong number for a number of `n` digits is an integer such that the sum of its digits raised to the power of `n` is equal to the number itself. 

Here are some Armstrong numbers for different digit lengths:
- 0 (0^1)
- 1 (1^1)
- 153 (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3)
- 370 (3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3)
- 371 (3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3)
- 407 (4^3 + 0^3 + 7^3)
- 1634 (1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4)

Now, let's analyze the provided function:

```python
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

### Analysis

1. **Conversion to String**: The function converts the input number `num` to a string in order to iterate over its digits, which is appropriate.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The function calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits (which is correct).
3. **Comparison**: At the end, it checks whether the calculated sum equals the original number, which is also correct logic.

### Edge Cases
- **Negative Numbers**: The function will return `False` for negative numbers, as there are no negative Armstrong numbers, which is correct.
- **Single-Digit Numbers**: All single-digit numbers (0-9) are Armstrong numbers, and the function will return `True` for these cases.
- **Zero**: Specifically, 0 is an Armstrong number as 0**1 = 0.

### Testing with Input
- For `num = 153`, the function will calculate \( 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 \) and correctly return `True`.
- For `num = 370`, it will correctly return `True`.
- For `num = 371`, it will also return `True`.
- For `num = 407`, it will return `True`.
- For `num = 1634`, it will return `True`.

The program handles these typical Armstrong number cases and edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion
Since I cannot identify any potential case where the function would return incorrect results based on the problem description, we confirm that the function meets the requirements as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
