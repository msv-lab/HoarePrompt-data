Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is designed to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. However, there is a logical flaw in how it calculates the insertion point, specifically regarding the handling of duplicate values.

The assertion `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2` is intended to verify that 3 should be inserted at index 2. This is correct because 3 is larger than 2 and less than 4. However, this is inherently the correct behavior of `bisect.bisect_right`, which returns the index to insert an element just after any existing entries of that value.

The flaw lies in the assertion cases provided. For example, if we consider the value `5`, the line `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 5) == 3` would fail because `bisect.bisect_right` would return 4 (to the right of the last `5`), indicating the next index would be 4.

Thus, while the given examples may seem to work correctly, the function does not align perfectly with the problem description across all possible cases, including edge cases related to duplicate values.

Therefore, because even a single case shows it does not behave as intended, the correctness is marked as false.
