Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to determine whether a given array contains any duplicate elements, but the implementation is flawed. The function `func_1(arr)` returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are not. However, the return value is inverted: it returns `True` when the lengths of the original array and the set representation of the array are different (indicating duplicates exist), and `False` when they are the same (indicating no duplicates). 

For example, consider the input:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected: False (no duplicates)
```
This should return `False` because there are no duplicates, but instead, it returns `True`.

Therefore, since the function does not return the correct outcomes for all cases, the correctness is false.
