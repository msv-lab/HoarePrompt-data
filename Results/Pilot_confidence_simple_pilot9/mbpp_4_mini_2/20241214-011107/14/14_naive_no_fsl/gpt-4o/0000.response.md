Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1(arr)` correctly identifies whether there are duplicate integers in the input array `arr`. It does this by using a set called `seen` to track integers that have already been encountered. 

Here's why the program is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description:

1. **No duplicates:** The case `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `False`, which correctly indicates that there are no duplicates in the array.
   
2. **With duplicates:** The case `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])` returns `True`, correctly identifying that `4` is a duplicate.

3. **Multiple duplicates:** The case `func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5])` also returns `True`, accurately reflecting the presence of duplicates.

The logic is implemented correctly by iterating through the array and checking if each number is already in the `seen` set, adding it if not. This approach covers all possible scenarios of duplicates, including when the input array is empty or contains only one element (both cases would return `False` as there can't be duplicates).

Overall, the function handles all expected cases as required by the problem description, and thus it is deemed correct.
