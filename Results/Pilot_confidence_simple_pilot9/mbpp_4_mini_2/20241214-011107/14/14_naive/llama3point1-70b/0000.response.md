Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly identifies whether an array of integers contains any duplicate elements. It does this by comparing the length of the original list `arr` with the length of the set created from `arr`. Since sets do not allow duplicate values, if the lengths are different, it implies that there were duplicates in the original list.

Here are some test cases to support its correctness:

1. Input: `[1, 2, 3]` ➔ Output: `False` (no duplicates)
2. Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3]` ➔ Output: `True` (duplicate `2`)
3. Input: `[]` ➔ Output: `False` (empty array, no duplicates)
4. Input: `[1, 1, 1]` ➔ Output: `True` (all elements are duplicates)

Since the logic works correctly across various scenarios and handles empty arrays, the program meets the problem requirements comprehensively.
