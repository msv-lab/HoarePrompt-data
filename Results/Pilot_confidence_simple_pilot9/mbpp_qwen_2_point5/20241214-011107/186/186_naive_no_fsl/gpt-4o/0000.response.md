Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to perform element-wise operations on the tuples. However, the problem description does not specify that the operation should be a bitwise AND. Instead, the problem description asks to "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples," which implies a simple comparison or extraction rather than a bitwise operation.

For instance, if the problem intended for the function to return a tuple where each element is 1 if the corresponding elements in the input tuples are equal and 0 otherwise, the function would need to be modified. Here's an example of a case where the current implementation fails:

Given input tuples `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, the expected output based on the problem description might be `(0, 0, 0, 0)` because no elements are equal.

The current implementation returns `(1, 2, 3, 0)` which is incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
