Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening symbols and ensures they match the corresponding closing symbols in the correct order. The examples given (`'{()}[{}]'`, `'{{()[]{}}}'`, and `'{{()[]{}}[]}'`) all correctly evaluate to `True`, and the example with an unbalanced expression (`'{()}[{]'`) correctly evaluates to `False`. There are no apparent edge cases or issues with the logic provided. Therefore, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases based on the problem description.
