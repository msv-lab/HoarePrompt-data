Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list with all the elements of the second list. The function works as expected for the given test cases:

1. `assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`
2. `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
3. `assert func_1(['red', 'blue', 'green'], ['yellow']) == ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']`

The function uses slicing (`list1[:-1]`) to get all elements of `list1` except the last one, and then concatenates (`+`) it with `list2`. This approach ensures that the last element of `list1` is replaced by all elements of `list2`, meeting the problem description for the given examples and a general case. Since no counterexample has been found, the program is considered correct.
