Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly handles the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the first list (`list1`) is non-empty. If it is, it replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it simply assigns `list2` to `list1`. This behavior matches the problem description exactly, as it replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list (or assigns the second list entirely if the first list is empty). There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail according to the given problem description.
