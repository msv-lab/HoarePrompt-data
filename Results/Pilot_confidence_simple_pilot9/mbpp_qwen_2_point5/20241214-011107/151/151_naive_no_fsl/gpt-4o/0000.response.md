Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided `func_1` function correctly flattens the given nested list structures. It recursively processes each element in the input list. If an element is a list, it calls itself recursively to further flatten that sublist; otherwise, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their nesting level, are added to the final flattened list. Given the examples provided and the recursive nature of the function, it appears that the function works correctly for all potential cases of nested lists.
