Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module, which returns the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list, ensuring that all elements to the left of the insertion point are less than the specified value. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns 4, which is correct because 6 would be inserted at the end of the list.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns 2, which is correct because 3 would be inserted between 2 and 4.
3. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` returns 4, which is correct because 7 would be inserted at the end of the list.

Since the function behaves correctly for the provided test cases and the behavior of `bisect_right` is well-defined, the function should handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description.
