Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and demonstrate that the function works as expected for the given inputs. There does not appear to be any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling based on the problem description and the examples provided.
