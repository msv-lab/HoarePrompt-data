Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value satisfies the condition `v >= n`. This implementation handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement without any issues.
