Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and uses the `max` function with `key=sum` to find the list with the highest sum of elements. This approach is correct because the `max` function with the `key` parameter will compare the sums of the lists and return the one with the maximum sum. Given the problem description, this function meets the requirements for any potential case where the input is a non-empty list of lists. Therefore, the program is correct.
