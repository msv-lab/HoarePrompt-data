Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements in a list of lists. The `max` function with the `key=sum` argument ensures that the list with the maximum sum is returned. This solution works for all potential cases as long as the input is a list of lists where each sublist contains numeric values. There are no edge cases or inputs that would make this function incorrect based on the problem description.
