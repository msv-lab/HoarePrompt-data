Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates through natural numbers, calculating the corresponding triangular number until it finds one that has at least `n` digits. The formula used for generating triangular numbers is correct, and the condition to check the number of digits is also accurate. Since the function handles all cases where `n` is a positive integer, and it correctly returns the index when such a triangular number is found, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
