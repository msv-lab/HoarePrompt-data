Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates through natural numbers `k`, calculates the corresponding triangular number, and checks if its string length equals `n`. Once it finds such a triangular number, it returns the value of `k`.

Given the assertions:
- For `n=2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, which is the 4th triangular number (`4 * 5 // 2 = 10`).
- For `n=3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 105, which is the 14th triangular number (`14 * 15 // 2 = 105`).
- For `n=4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 1035, which is the 45th triangular number (`45 * 46 // 2 = 1035`).

These results match the expected outputs, and the logic in the function seems sound for generating triangular numbers and checking their digit count. Since no counterexample has been found and the function passes the provided test cases, the program is correct for the described problem.
