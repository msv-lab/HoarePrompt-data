Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates over possible values of `k`, calculates the corresponding triangular number, and checks its digit length until it finds the correct value. Given the examples provided:
- For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, which corresponds to `k = 4`.
- For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 105, which corresponds to `k = 14`.
- For `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 1035, which corresponds to `k = 45`.

The function works as expected for these cases and does not seem to miss any edge cases or fail for other inputs based on the problem description.
