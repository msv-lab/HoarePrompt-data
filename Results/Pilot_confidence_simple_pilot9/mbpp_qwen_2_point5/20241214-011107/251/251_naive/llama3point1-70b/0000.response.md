Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†). The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radius \( r \) and `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle \( \phi \). These functions handle all potential cases, including negative values for x and y. There is no scenario where this function would fail to meet the requirements described in the problem statement.
