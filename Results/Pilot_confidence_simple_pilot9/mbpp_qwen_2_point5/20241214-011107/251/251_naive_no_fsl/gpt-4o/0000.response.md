Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). It calculates the radius `r` using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the angle `θ` using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which accounts for the correct quadrant of the angle. The examples given in the assertions cover different scenarios and verify the correctness of the function for those specific inputs. Since the function handles the conversion accurately for the given test cases and there is no indication of any edge cases being missed, the program appears to be correct for the described task.
