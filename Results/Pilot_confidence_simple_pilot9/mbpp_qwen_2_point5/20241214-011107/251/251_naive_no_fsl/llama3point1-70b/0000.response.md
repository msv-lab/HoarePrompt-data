Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, phi)`. The `math.hypot(x, y)` function computes the Euclidean norm (hypotenuse), which corresponds to the radius `r` in polar coordinates. The `math.atan2(y, x)` function computes the angle `phi` with respect to the positive x-axis, which is the correct way to calculate the angle in polar coordinates. This function handles all potential cases where both `x` and `y` are finite numbers. There are no edge cases like division by zero because `math.atan2` inherently avoids this issue by using the signs of both `x` and `y` to determine the correct quadrant. Therefore, the function works correctly for all valid inputs.
