Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list, filtering out elements that appear more than once using the condition `lst.count(i) == 1`. For each unique element, it returns the sum of these elements. This logic aligns with the problem description and works for all potential cases, including edge cases like empty lists or lists with duplicate elements. Therefore, the program is correct.
