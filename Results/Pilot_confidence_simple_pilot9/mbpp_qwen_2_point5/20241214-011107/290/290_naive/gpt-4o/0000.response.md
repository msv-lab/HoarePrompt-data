Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the character 'z' (except at the start and end of the word). The function checks if 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which excludes the first and last characters of the string. Given the test cases:

- `func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: This is correct because 'z' is found within the substring `pythonabc`.
- `func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: This is correct because 'z' is not found within the substring `xyabc`.
- `func_1('  lang  .') == False`: This is correct because 'z' is not present within the substring `lang`.

Since the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases and the logic correctly handles the requirement to exclude the first and last characters, the function is correct for the given problem description.
