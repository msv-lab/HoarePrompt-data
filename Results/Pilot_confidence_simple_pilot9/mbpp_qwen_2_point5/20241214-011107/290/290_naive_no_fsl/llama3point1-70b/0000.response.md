Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the character 'z' (excluding the first and last characters) for each word in the input string. The function splits the input string into words and iterates through each word. It then checks if the length of the word is greater than 1 and if 'z' is present in the substring excluding the first and last characters. This logic ensures that 'z' is not checked at the start and end of each word. Since the function adheres to the problem description for all cases, the correctness is True.
