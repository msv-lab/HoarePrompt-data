Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a set comprehension to collect the types of all elements in the tuple `tup`. Since sets cannot contain duplicate values, if all elements in the tuple have the same data type, the length of the resulting set will be 1. This approach correctly identifies tuples where all elements share the same data type, covering all potential cases without any exceptions.
