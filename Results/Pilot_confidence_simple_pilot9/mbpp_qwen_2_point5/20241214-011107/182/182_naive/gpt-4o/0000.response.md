Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (the last character) of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string in the tuple and appends its last character to the resulting list. Given the test cases:

- `func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers'))` returns `['s', 'r', 's']`
- `func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People'))` returns `['e', 'r', 'e']`
- `func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go'))` returns `['a', 't', 'o']`

These results match the problem description perfectly. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail based on the provided examples and the general logic of extracting the last character from each string. Therefore, the program is correct.
