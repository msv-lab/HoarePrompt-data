Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear (last) index element from each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string in the tuple and returns the last character of each string. This logic is consistent across all provided test cases and seems to handle the problem description accurately for the given inputs. Since no specific edge cases or inputs were mentioned in the problem description that this function might fail, and all the provided assertions pass, the function appears to be correct for the described task.
