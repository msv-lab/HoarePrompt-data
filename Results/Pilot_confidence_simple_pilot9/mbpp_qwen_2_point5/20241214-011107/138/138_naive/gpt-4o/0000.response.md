Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. It checks if the current element matches the target element and returns a tuple with `True` and the index if a match is found. If no match is found after iterating through the entire array, it returns `(False, -1)`. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases, as it handles both the presence and absence of the target element in the array. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected.
