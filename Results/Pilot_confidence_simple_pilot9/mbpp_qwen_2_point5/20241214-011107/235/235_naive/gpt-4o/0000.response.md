Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function uses a while loop to iterate through each digit of the number, adding them to the `total` variable. The modulo operation (`n % 10`) extracts the last digit, and the floor division operation (`n //= 10`) removes the last digit from the number. This process continues until all digits have been processed. Given the provided test cases and the logic of the function, it handles the problem description accurately for the tested scenarios and should work correctly for any non-negative integer.
