Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list by using a generator expression within the `sum` function. This approach effectively sums up the boolean values (`True` for integers, `False` for non-integers), resulting in the total count of integer elements. Since this logic covers all potential cases without any exceptions, the program is correct according to the problem description.
