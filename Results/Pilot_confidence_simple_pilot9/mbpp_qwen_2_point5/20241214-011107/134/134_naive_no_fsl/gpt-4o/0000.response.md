Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). This is correct because the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients in the expansion of \((1+1)^n\) is indeed \(2^{(n-1)}\).

Given the test cases:
- `func_1(4)` returns \(2^{(4-1)} = 2^3 = 8\)
- `func_1(6)` returns \(2^{(6-1)} = 2^5 = 32\)
- `func_1(2)` returns \(2^{(2-1)} = 2^1 = 2\)

These results align with the problem description, and since the formula holds true for these cases, we can infer that the function works correctly for other inputs as well. Therefore, the program is correct.
