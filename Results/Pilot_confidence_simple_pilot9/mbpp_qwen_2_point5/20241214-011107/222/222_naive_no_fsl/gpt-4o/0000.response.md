Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` removes all lowercase substrings from a given string and returns only the uppercase characters. Based on the problem description and the examples provided:

- `func_1('PYTHon')` returns `'PYTH'`, which is correct because all characters are already uppercase.
- `func_1('FInD')` returns `'FID'`, which is correct because 'I' is removed as it is lowercase.
- `func_1('STRinG')` returns `'STRG'`, which is correct because 'in' is removed and only uppercase 'S', 'T', 'R', and 'G' remain.

Since the function behaves as expected for the given examples and no other potential cases are found where the function fails, the program is correct.
