Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` removes lowercase substrings from a given string but fails to handle cases where the string contains only lowercase letters or a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters without any specific pattern that would trigger removal. For instance, if the input string consists entirely of lowercase letters, the function will return an empty string, which does not meet the requirement to remove lowercase substrings. Here's an example:

- Input: `"hello"`
- Expected Output: `""`
- Actual Output: `""`

While the output is technically correct in this specific case (since there are no uppercase characters), the function does not correctly handle the problem description for strings that do not contain any uppercase characters. Therefore, the function is not correct according to the problem description.
