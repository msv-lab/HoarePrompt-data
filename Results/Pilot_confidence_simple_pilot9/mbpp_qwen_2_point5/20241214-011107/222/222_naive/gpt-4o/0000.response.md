Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the given string. Instead, it removes all lowercase letters, leaving only uppercase letters. This does not meet the requirement of removing substrings, but rather individual characters. For example, the string "PYTHon" should result in "PYTH" after removing the lowercase substring "on", but the program returns "PYTH" which is incorrect because it treats each character individually rather than considering substrings.
