Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string in all potential cases. Hereâ€™s a brief analysis:

1. **Case when both first and last occurrences are present:**
   - For example, `func_1("hello", "l")` returns `"heo"`. This is correct as both the first and last occurrences of 'l' are removed.

2. **Case when only the first occurrence is present:**
   - For example, `func_1("hello", "h")` returns `"ello"`. This is correct as only the first occurrence of 'h' is removed.

3. **Case when only the last occurrence is present:**
   - For example, `func_1("hello", "o")` returns `"hell"`. This is correct as only the last occurrence of 'o' is removed.

4. **Case when neither the first nor the last occurrence is present:**
   - For example, `func_1("hello", "z")` returns `"hello"`. This is correct as the character 'z' is not found in the string, so the original string is returned unchanged.

5. **Case when the first and last occurrences are the same:**
   - For example, `func_1("level", "l")` returns `"ev"` after removing both the first and last 'l'. This is correct as both occurrences are removed.

Since the program handles all these cases correctly, it meets the requirements of the problem description in every potential scenario. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
