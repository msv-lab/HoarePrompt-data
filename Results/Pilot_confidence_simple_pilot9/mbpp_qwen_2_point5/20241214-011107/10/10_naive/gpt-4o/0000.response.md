Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\right) \times \text{length} \]

The examples provided also correctly validate the function for different inputs:

1. For `func_1(10, 8, 6)`, the base area is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 8 = 40 \), and the volume is \( 40 \times 6 = 240 \).
2. For `func_1(3, 2, 2)`, the base area is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 2 = 3 \), and the volume is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).
3. For `func_1(1, 2, 1)`, the base area is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 2 = 1 \), and the volume is \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \).

Since the function correctly implements the formula and the provided examples confirm its correctness, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases described in the problem.
