Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The use of `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing the function to iterate over each position across all tuples simultaneously. The sum of values at each position is divided by the number of tuples to compute the average. This approach ensures that the function works for any list of tuples with the same number of elements in each tuple, meeting the requirements of the problem description. Since no specific edge cases or examples were found where the program fails to meet the requirements, the code appears to be correct.
