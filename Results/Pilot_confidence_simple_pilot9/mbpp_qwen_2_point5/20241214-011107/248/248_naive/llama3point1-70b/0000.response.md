Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple for any input list. Since the function simply uses the built-in `tuple()` function, it will work correctly for all types of lists, including empty lists and lists containing various data types. There are no potential edge cases that this function would fail to handle within the scope of the problem description.
