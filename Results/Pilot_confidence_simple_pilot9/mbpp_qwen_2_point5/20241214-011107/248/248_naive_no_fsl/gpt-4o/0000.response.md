Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as described in the problem statement. The function uses the built-in `tuple` function to convert the input list `lst` into a tuple and returns it. All the provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected. Since there is no indication of any edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail, we can conclude that the function is correct.
