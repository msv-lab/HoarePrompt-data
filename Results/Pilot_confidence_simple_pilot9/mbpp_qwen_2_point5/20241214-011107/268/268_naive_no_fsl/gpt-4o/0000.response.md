Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The function iterates through each row of the matrix, extracts the n'th element from each row, and then finds the maximum value among these elements. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and verify the function's correctness:

1. The first test case checks a scenario where the maximum value in the specified column (2nd column) is located at the bottom of the matrix.
2. The second test case checks a scenario where the maximum value in the specified column (1st column) is located in the middle of the matrix.
3. The third test case checks a scenario where the maximum value in the specified column (1st column) is also located in the middle of the matrix but with a different set of values.

Since the function works correctly for the provided test cases and the logic seems sound for finding the maximum value in any column of a matrix, the program is correct. There doesn't appear to be any edge case or potential issue with the given implementation.
