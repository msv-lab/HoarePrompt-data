Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in the list under all potential cases. Here's why:

1. **Removing Duplicates**: By converting the list to a set and then back to a list (`unique_nums`), duplicates are removed.
2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2, the function correctly returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest element.
3. **Sorting and Returning**: The list `unique_nums` is sorted, and the second element (at index 1) is returned as the second smallest number.

Since the function handles all cases correctly, including edge cases like lists with fewer than two unique elements, the provided function meets the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is `True`.
