Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the input string. The examples given cover various scenarios including multiple spaces, leading spaces, and trailing spaces. Since the function correctly handles these cases, and the `replace` method removes all occurrences of the specified character (in this case, space), we can conclude that the function works as expected for all potential cases involving whitespace removal.
