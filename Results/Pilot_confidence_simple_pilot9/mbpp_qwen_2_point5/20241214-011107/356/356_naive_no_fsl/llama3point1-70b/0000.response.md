Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. This method will replace all occurrences of the specified space character (' ') with an empty string, effectively removing all whitespaces. Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases (i.e., it removes all types of whitespace characters), the program is correct.
