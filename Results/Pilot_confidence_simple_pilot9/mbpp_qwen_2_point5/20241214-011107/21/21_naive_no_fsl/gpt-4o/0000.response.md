Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list. The assertions in the code cover three different scenarios: a list with multiple numbers, a list with the smallest number being the first element, and a list with numbers in ascending order. Since the `min` function works correctly for these cases and the function implementation is straightforward without any missing logic or edge cases, the program is correct for the described problem.
