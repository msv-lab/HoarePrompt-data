Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` correctly uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. Given the problem description to write a function that finds the smallest number in a list, this function meets the requirement for all potential cases, assuming the list is non-empty and contains only numbers. If the list is empty, the `min()` function would raise a `ValueError`, which is a valid behavior for such an input scenario, but the problem description does not specify handling of empty lists, so we consider the function correct within its intended scope.
