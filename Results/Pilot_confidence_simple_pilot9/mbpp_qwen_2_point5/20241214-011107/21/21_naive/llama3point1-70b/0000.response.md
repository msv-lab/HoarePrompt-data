Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. This approach works for all potential cases where `nums` is a list of numbers, including lists with duplicate smallest elements, empty lists (though it would raise a `ValueError`), and lists with negative numbers. Since the function adheres to the problem description and handles all typical cases without error, it can be considered correct.
