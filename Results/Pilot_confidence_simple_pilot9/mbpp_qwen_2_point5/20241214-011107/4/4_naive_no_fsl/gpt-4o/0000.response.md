Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The logic used is sound: performing a bitwise XOR operation (`a ^ b`) will result in a number with bits set to 1 wherever the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` differ. If the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, the XOR result will be a power of 2 (i.e., its binary representation contains exactly one '1'). The condition `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` checks if the result is a power of 2. Additionally, ensuring `xor_result != 0` ensures that the numbers are not identical, which would trivially satisfy the condition of differing at exactly one bit but not be meaningful in this context.

All the provided test cases correctly validate the function's behavior. Therefore, the function is correct for the given problem description.
