Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The range function is used with a step of 2, starting from 2, which generates the sequence of the first `n` even natural numbers. The generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` computes the cube of each even number in this sequence, and the `sum` function adds them up. This approach works for all positive integer values of `n`, including edge cases such as `n = 0` (which would result in a sum of 0) and small values of `n`. Since the program handles these cases correctly, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
