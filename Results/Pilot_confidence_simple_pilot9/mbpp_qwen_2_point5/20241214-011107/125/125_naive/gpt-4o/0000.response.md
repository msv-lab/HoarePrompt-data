Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not split the list every nth element but instead splits the list into n sublists where each sublist contains elements from the original list. For example, when `n=3`, the program groups elements into three sublists based on their index modulo `n`, which is not the same as splitting the list every nth element.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 3)
```

The expected output based on the problem description would be:

```
[[1, 4, 7, 10], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
```

However, the program's output is:

```
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10]]
```

This shows that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, hence the correctness is **False**.
