Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` containing the numbers of months that have 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12). The function checks if the given month is in this set and returns the appropriate boolean value. Based on the assertions provided, the function works correctly for the given test cases (January, February, June, July). There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues that would make the program incorrect for other valid month numbers. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
