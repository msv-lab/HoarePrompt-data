Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a string are the same. The function works correctly for the given assertions and also handles edge cases such as an empty string, which is considered to have all characters the same. The logic inside the function iterates through each character in the string and compares it with the first character. If any character is different, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. Since the function correctly handles all tested cases and the logic appears to cover all potential scenarios, the program is correct.
