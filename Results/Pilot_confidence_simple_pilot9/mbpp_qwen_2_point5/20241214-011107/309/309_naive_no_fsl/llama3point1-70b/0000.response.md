Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This approach is correct because a set contains only unique elements, so if all characters are the same, the set will contain exactly one element.

Since the function works as intended for any string input, and there are no edge cases or inputs that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
