Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided `func_1` function rounds each number in the given list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The function appears to handle all cases correctly based on the assertions provided:

1. The first assertion checks a list with both positive and negative floating-point numbers.
2. The second assertion checks a list with integer values.
3. The third assertion checks a list with only positive floating-point numbers.

Since the function behaves as expected in all tested cases and there are no apparent logical errors or missing edge cases, the function is correct.
