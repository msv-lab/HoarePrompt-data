Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`.

The function correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It ensures that all elements at odd indices are odd. Since the function correctly handles all potential cases without any missing logic or edge cases that would cause it to fail, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
