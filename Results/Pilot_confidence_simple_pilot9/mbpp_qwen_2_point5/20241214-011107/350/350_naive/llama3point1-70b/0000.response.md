Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the last position of a target element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, checking for the target value. When it finds the target, it returns the current index. If the target is not found, it returns -1. This approach ensures that the last occurrence of the target is found, which meets the requirements of the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs that this program would fail for, given its straightforward implementation.
