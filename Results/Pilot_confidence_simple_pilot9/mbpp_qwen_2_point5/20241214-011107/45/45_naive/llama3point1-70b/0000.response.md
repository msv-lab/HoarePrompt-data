Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify undulating numbers. An undulating number is defined as a number which has the form ABABAB... (where A and B are its digits and A is not equal to B). The program checks only a single pass through the string and does not ensure that the pattern ABAB... continues throughout the entire number. 

For example, consider the number `121212`. According to the problem description, this should be an undulating number. However, the current implementation might fail to recognize this because it only checks up to a certain point and does not validate the entire sequence. 

A correct implementation would need to ensure that the alternating pattern of digits continues throughout the entire length of the number. Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
def is_undulating(n):
    n = str(n)
    if len(n) < 3 or n[0] == n[1]: 
        return False
    prev_digit = n[0]
    for i in range(2, len(n)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and n[i] != prev_digit:
            return False
        elif i % 2 != 0 and n[i] == prev_digit:
            return False
        prev_digit = n[i]
    return True
```

This revised function ensures that the alternating pattern of digits continues throughout the entire number, making it correctly identify undulating numbers.
