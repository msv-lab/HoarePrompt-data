Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly adds the elements of the given tuple to the end of the given list. The examples provided demonstrate this clearly:

1. `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
2. `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`.
3. `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.

Since the function correctly concatenates the list and the tuple for the given examples, and the implementation `return lst + list(tpl)` logically appends the tuple elements to the list, we can infer that the function should work for any list and tuple. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified that would make the function incorrect. Therefore, the program is correct.
