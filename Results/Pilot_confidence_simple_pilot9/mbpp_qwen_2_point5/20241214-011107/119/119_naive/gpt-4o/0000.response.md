Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input parameters and returns them as a tuple. The examples given (`func_1(10, 20)`, `func_1(15, 17)`, and `func_1(100, 200)`) all demonstrate the function working as intended. Since the function returns the second parameter followed by the first parameter in a tuple, it satisfies the problem description for the given test cases. There doesn't seem to be any potential case where this function would fail based on the problem statement.
