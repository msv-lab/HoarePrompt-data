Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a list. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that are odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The provided test cases demonstrate the function working correctly for different inputs, including lists with multiple odd and even numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers. Since the function behaves as expected in all tested cases and the logic appears sound, the program is correct.
