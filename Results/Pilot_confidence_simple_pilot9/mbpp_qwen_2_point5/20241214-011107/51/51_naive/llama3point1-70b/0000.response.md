Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. This implementation handles all potential cases, including empty lists (where the function returns 0 since `len(numbers)` would be 0), and lists with any number of elements. There is no apparent flaw in the logic that would cause the function to fail under any circumstances as per the problem description.
