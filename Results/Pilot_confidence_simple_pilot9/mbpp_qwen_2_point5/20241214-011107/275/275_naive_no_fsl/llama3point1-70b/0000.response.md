Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The program sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum subset size ending at each index. This approach ensures that for each element, it checks all previous elements to see if they can form a valid pair (i.e., the current element is divisible by the previous element), updating the DP array accordingly.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program seems to handle all edge cases correctly:
- An empty list returns 0, which is correct.
- For non-empty lists, it correctly identifies the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

Since no specific edge cases or inputs were mentioned that the program fails, and the logic aligns with the problem statement, the program is correct.
