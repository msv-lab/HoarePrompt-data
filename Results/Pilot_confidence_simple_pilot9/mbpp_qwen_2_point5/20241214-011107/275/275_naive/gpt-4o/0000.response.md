Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic for finding the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum subset size ending at each index. 

Let's break down the logic:
- It first checks if the input list `nums` is empty, returning 0 if true.
- It sorts the list to ensure that we only check divisibility from smaller to larger elements.
- It initializes a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset ending at index `i`.
- For each element, it checks all previous elements to see if they divide the current element. If so, it updates `dp[i]` accordingly.

The provided test cases:
- `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]` returns 4, which is correct as the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.
- `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]` returns 3, which is correct as the largest subset is `[10, 5, 20]`.
- `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]` returns 4, which is correct as the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.

Since the program passes the given test cases and the logic appears sound, it is correct for the described problem. There doesn't seem to be any obvious edge cases or scenarios where this function would fail based on the provided information.
