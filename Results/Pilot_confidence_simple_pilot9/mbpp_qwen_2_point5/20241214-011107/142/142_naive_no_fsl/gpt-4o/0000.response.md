Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the loop without finding any such item, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
1. An list with elements that do not match the given element (`['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white']`, `'blue'`) results in `False`.
2. A list with elements that do not all match the given element (`[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `7`) also results in `False`.
3. A list where all elements match the given element (`['green', 'green', 'green', 'green']`, `'green'`) results in `True`.

Since the function behaves as expected in these cases and no edge cases have been identified where the function fails, the program is correct.
