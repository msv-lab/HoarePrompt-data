Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through the sorted array `arr` using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. It checks if the current element `x` matches the given number `num`. If a match is found, it returns the index immediately. If no match is found after checking all elements, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the function finds the first occurrence of the given number in the sorted array and handles the case where the number is not present by returning `-1`. Since the function meets the requirements for all potential cases, the correctness is True.
