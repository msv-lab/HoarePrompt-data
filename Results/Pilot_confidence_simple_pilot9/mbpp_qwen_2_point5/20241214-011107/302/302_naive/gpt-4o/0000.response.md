Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program implements a binary search algorithm, but it does not handle the case where the `target` is not present in the array. According to the problem description, the function should return the index of the first occurrence of the `target`. However, if the `target` is not found, the function currently returns `-1`, which does not satisfy the requirement to return the first occurrence index. 

For example, consider the case where the target is `7` in the array `[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]`. The program would return `-1` because the target is not found, but the problem description requires it to return `-1` only if the target is not found, and to return the first occurrence index if the target is present.

To fix this, the function should check if the `result` variable is still `-1` after the loop and then return `-1` if no valid index was found. Here's how the corrected code might look:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1  # Continue searching to the left
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

This corrected version ensures that the function returns the index of the first occurrence of the target, or `-1` if the target is not present in the array.
