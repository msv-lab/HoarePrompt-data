Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in ascending order. The function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
1. A completely sorted list (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`) returns `True`.
2. A list that is almost sorted but has one out-of-order element (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`) returns `False`.
3. A list that is not sorted due to a swap of two elements (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`) returns `False`.

Since the function handles these cases correctly and the logic seems sound for any input list, the program is correct.
