Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle, which is the product of its length and width. Given the problem description, the function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. This approach works for all potential cases where both `length` and `width` are valid numerical values (positive or negative). There are no edge cases or special conditions that this simple multiplication operation would fail to handle within the constraints of the problem description.
