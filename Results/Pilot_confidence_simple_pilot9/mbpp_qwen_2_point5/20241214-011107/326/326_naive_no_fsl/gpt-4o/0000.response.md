Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function first checks if the array size `n` is less than 2, returning 0 immediately if true, as there would be no pairs to compare. Otherwise, it sorts the array and iterates through adjacent elements to find the smallest difference. The assertions provided in the problem description also cover various scenarios, including arrays with duplicates, different magnitudes, and different sizes. Since the function handles these cases correctly and the provided test cases pass, the function is correct for the given problem description.
