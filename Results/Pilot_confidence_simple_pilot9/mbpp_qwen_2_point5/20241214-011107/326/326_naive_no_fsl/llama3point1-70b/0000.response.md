Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The function first sorts the array, which ensures that the elements are in non-decreasing order.
2. It initializes `min_diff` to infinity, ensuring that any difference calculated will be smaller initially.
3. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the next one and updating `min_diff` if the current difference is smaller.
4. Finally, it returns the smallest difference found.

Given the problem description, this function will correctly compute the minimum difference between any two elements in the array for any valid input. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where this function would fail to meet the requirements described.
