Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function first checks if the length of the array `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in that case, which is correct since no differences can be calculated. It then sorts the array and iterates through it to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the minimum difference is found, and the provided test cases confirm its correctness. Given the logic and the test cases, the function works as expected for the described problem.
