Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array by first sorting the array and then iterating through adjacent elements to find the smallest difference. However, this program does not handle the case where the array has less than two elements. If the array is empty or contains only one element, the program will raise an `IndexError` because `arr[i+1]` would be out of bounds. 

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to return `None` or handle the case appropriately if the array has fewer than two elements. For example:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return None  # or handle the case as per the requirement
    
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

This ensures that the function handles all potential cases correctly.
