Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. It uses list comprehension to iterate over the string and includes only characters with even indices. The provided test cases ('abcdef', 'python', 'data', 'lambs') all produce the expected results ('ace', 'pto', 'dt', 'lms'). Given the logic and the test cases, the function appears to handle the problem description correctly for the given examples and similar cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
