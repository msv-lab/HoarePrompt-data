Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the occurrences of each element from the list `lst` in the tuple `tup`. However, this approach only counts the total occurrences of elements from `lst` in `tup`, not the individual occurrences of each element as required by the problem description.

For instance, consider the following inputs:
- `tup = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'a')`
- `lst = ['a', 'd']`

The program will return `2` because `'a'` appears twice in `tup`, but it should return a dictionary or a list showing the count of each element in `lst`:
- The count of `'a'` is `2`.
- The count of `'d'` is `0`.

To meet the problem description, the function should return a dictionary or a list indicating the count of each element from `lst` in `tup`. Here is an example of how the function could be corrected:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return {element: tup.count(element) for element in lst}
```

This corrected version will return the correct counts for each element in `lst` within `tup`.
