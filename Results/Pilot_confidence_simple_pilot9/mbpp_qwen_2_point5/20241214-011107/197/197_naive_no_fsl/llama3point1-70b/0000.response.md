Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the elements in the list are tuples or other unhashable types. For instance, consider the following input:

```python
func_1(('a', 'b', 'c', 'a'), ['a', ('b',)])
```

In this case, the program will raise a `TypeError` because tuples are unhashable and cannot be used as elements in the generator expression inside `sum()`. The function should be modified to handle such cases, ensuring that all elements in the list are hashable before proceeding with the counting.
