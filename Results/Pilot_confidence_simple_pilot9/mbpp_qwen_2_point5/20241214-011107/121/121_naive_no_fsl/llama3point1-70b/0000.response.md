Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. However, the implementation of `func_2` has a flaw. The NSW primes are generated using a specific recurrence relation, and the current implementation does not adhere to this relation. Instead, it checks if a number is prime and if it satisfies certain modulo conditions, which is not sufficient to generate NSW primes.

To correctly generate NSW primes, the sequence should start with 7, and each subsequent term should be calculated using the recurrence relation:

\[ S_0 = 0 \]
\[ S_1 = 1 \]
\[ S_n = 2 \cdot S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \]

Then, the NSW prime at position \( n \) is the prime factor of \( S_n + 2 \) that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.

The given code does not implement this recurrence relation and instead checks for primality and modulo conditions, which may or may not produce NSW primes. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
