Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime sequence. The sequence is defined as follows:

1. \( P_1 = 2 \)
2. For \( n > 1 \), \( P_n = 2P_{n-1}^2 - 1 \)

However, the program uses a Fibonacci-like sequence to generate the numbers, which is not the correct sequence for Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. The first few terms of the correct sequence are 2, 7, 41, 239, 1393, etc., while the program generates 1, 7, 41, etc.

For example, when \( n = 1 \), the program returns 1, but the correct value should be 2. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for the problem description in all cases.
