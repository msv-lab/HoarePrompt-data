Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It splits the input string by underscores and capitalizes each resulting word except the first one, then joins them together without any separators. This logic matches the problem description for converting snake case to camel case. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
