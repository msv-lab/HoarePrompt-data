Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each word, and then joins them together without any additional characters. This approach handles all valid snake case strings correctly and there are no edge cases (like empty strings or strings without underscores) mentioned in the problem description that this program fails to handle. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described.
