Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings. It splits the snake case string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and then joins them together without any additional characters. Based on the assertions provided:

- `func_1('python_program') == 'PythonProgram'`
- `func_1('python_language') == 'PythonLanguage'`
- `func_1('programming_language') == 'ProgrammingLanguage'`

The function works as expected for these cases. Additionally, it handles the conversion for strings that start or end with underscores, or contain multiple consecutive underscores, which are common edge cases:

- For a string like `'__python__language__'`, the function will correctly output `'PythonLanguage'`.

Since the function correctly handles all tested cases and the general structure of converting snake case to camel case, the program is correct.
