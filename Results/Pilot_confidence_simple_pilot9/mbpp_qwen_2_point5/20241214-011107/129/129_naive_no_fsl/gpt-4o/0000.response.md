Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of a character. The assertions provided in the test cases (`func_1('A') == 65`, `func_1('R') == 82`, and `func_1('S') == 83`) all pass because the `ord()` function correctly returns the ASCII values for these characters. Since the function works as expected for these cases and the `ord()` function handles a wide range of characters (including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, punctuation, etc.), we can conclude that the function is correct for all potential cases.
