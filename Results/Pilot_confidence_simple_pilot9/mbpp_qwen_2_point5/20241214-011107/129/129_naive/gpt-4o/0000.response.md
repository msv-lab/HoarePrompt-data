Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the function `func_1` to find the ASCII value of a character using the `ord()` function. The assertions provided in the code also correctly test the function for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. Since the function works as expected for these examples and the `ord()` function handles all possible ASCII characters correctly, there are no known cases where this program would fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
