Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The assertions provided in the code also pass for the given test cases (90°, 60°, 120°), which are standard angles with known radian values. Since the function works correctly for these examples and the conversion logic is accurate, we can infer that the function will work correctly for any input degree value. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
