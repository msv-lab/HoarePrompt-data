Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula is accurate and the program uses the `math.pi` constant from the `math` module, which ensures the value of \(\pi\) is precise. Since the problem description only requires converting degrees to radians, and the program accurately performs this task without any errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
