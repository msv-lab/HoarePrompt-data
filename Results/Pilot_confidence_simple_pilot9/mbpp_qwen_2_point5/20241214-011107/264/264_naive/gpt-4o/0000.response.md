Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The given test cases assert that the function returns the correct values for 90, 60, and 120 degrees, which are \( \frac{\pi}{2} \), \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), and \( \frac{2\pi}{3} \) respectively. Since the function implements the conversion correctly and passes the provided assertions, it should work correctly for any valid degree value. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described.
