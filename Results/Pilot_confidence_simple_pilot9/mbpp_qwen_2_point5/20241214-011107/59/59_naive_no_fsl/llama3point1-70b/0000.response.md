Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` merges three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) into a single list and sorts it using Python's built-in `sorted` function. This function will work correctly for any input lists, as the `sorted` function is designed to handle any iterable input and produce a sorted list. There are no edge cases or specific scenarios where this function would fail to meet the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
