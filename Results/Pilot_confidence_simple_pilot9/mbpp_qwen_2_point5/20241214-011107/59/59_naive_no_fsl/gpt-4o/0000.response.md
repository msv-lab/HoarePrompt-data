Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` merges three lists into a single list and sorts it. The examples given in the assertions cover various scenarios including lists with duplicates, lists in different orders (ascending and descending), and lists with varying lengths. The function consistently combines and sorts the lists as expected in all provided cases. Given that the function correctly handles the provided examples and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
