Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. This works for all potential cases, including edge cases such as when `L` is 0, equal to the length of the list, or when the list is empty. Here are a few examples:

- For `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `L = 2`, the function returns `([1, 2], [3, 4, 5])`.
- For `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `L = 5`, the function returns `([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [])`.
- For `lst = []` and `L = 3`, the function returns `([], [])`.

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
