Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` returns the opposite of what the problem description requires. The function should check if the parity of a given number is odd, which means it should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, the current implementation returns `True` if `n % 2 != 0`, which is equivalent to checking if the number is odd. Therefore, the function needs to be corrected to return `False` if `n % 2 != 0` and `True` if `n % 2 == 0`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

This corrected function will correctly identify whether the parity of a given number is even.
