Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd by checking if `n % 2 != 0`. This condition returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. Since the function works as expected for all integer inputs, it meets the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.
