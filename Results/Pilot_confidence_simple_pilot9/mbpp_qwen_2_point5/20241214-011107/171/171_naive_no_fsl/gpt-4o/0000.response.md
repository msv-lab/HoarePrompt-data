Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a number is odd by using the condition `n % 2 != 0`. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function should actually check if the number is even, not odd. 

For example, if we test `func_1(12)`, the expected output should be `True` (since 12 is even), but the function returns `False`. Similarly, `func_1(10)` should return `True`, but it returns `False`.

The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

This would ensure that the function correctly identifies whether a number has even parity.
