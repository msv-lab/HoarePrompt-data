Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. This method returns the number of times the specified element appears in the tuple. Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases (it works correctly for any tuple and any element), the program is correct.
