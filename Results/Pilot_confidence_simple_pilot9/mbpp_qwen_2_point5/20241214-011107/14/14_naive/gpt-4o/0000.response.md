Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements. It uses a set to keep track of seen elements and returns `True` as soon as a duplicate is found. The examples provided also correctly demonstrate the functionality:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `False` because there are no duplicates.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])` returns `True` because the number `4` appears more than once.
- `func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5])` returns `True` because each pair of identical numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) is identified as a duplicate.

Given that the function works as expected in the provided examples and there are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that would cause it to fail, the function is correct.
