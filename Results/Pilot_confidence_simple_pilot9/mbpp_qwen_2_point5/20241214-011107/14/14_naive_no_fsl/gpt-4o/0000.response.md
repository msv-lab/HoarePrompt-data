Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a set to keep track of seen numbers. It iterates through the array and checks if the current number is already in the set. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating a duplicate exists. Otherwise, it adds the number to the set and continues. This approach ensures that the function will correctly identify duplicates for any input array of integers. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including arrays with no duplicates, arrays with a single duplicate, and arrays with multiple duplicates. Since the function behaves as expected in these cases and the logic appears sound, the program is correct.
