Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided checks if the length of the array is different from the length of the set of the array. This works correctly for identifying duplicates, but it has an issue with empty arrays or arrays containing only unique elements. Specifically, an empty array would incorrectly return `True` (since `len([]) == len(set([]))`), and an array with unique elements would also incorrectly return `True` for having no duplicates. For example:

- For an empty array `[]`, the function returns `True`, which is incorrect because there are no duplicates.
- For an array with unique elements like `[1, 2, 3]`, the function also returns `True`, which is incorrect because there are no duplicates.

To fix this, the function should explicitly handle these edge cases. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return False
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))
```

This version correctly handles both empty arrays and arrays with unique elements.
