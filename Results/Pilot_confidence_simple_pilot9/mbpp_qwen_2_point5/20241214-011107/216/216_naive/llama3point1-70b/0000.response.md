Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list and then checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1 using a generator expression inside the `all()` function. Additionally, it ensures that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list, which means all elements are unique. This approach correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers, including those with duplicate elements like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and lists with missing elements like `[1, 3, 4, 5]`. Since the function handles all edge cases correctly and meets the requirements specified in the problem description, it is considered correct.
