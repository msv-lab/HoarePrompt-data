Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the total number of friends \( M \) and the required number of new coins \( L \) exceed the number of different coins \( N \). Specifically, the condition `if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:` is not sufficient to ensure that all friends can gift different coins.

For example, consider the following input:
```
10 11 2 4
```
Here, \( N = 10 \), \( M = 11 \), \( K = 2 \), and \( L = 4 \). According to the problem description, all friends must gift different coins, and not less than 4 coins must be new in Ivan's collection. However, the program incorrectly prints `1` because \( M \geq N - K + 1 \) (i.e., \( 11 \geq 10 - 2 + 1 \)) and \( M \geq L \) (i.e., \( 11 \geq 4 \)).

In reality, since there are only 10 different coins available and 11 friends, it is impossible for all friends to gift different coins. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`.
