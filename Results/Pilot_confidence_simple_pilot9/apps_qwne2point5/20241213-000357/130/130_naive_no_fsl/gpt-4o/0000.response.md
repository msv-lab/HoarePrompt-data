Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) from standard input.
2. **Calculating Minimum Coins**: It calculates the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`. This ensures that the total number of new coins received by Ivan is at least \(L\).
3. **Checking Feasibility**: It checks if \(M \times \text{min\_x} \leq N - K\). If this condition holds, it prints \(\text{min\_x}\); otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

Given the constraints and the logic used, the program correctly handles all described cases. For instance:
- In the first example, with \(N=20\), \(M=15\), \(K=2\), and \(L=3\), the calculation shows that each friend needs to gift 1 coin, which results in 15 unique coins, ensuring at least 13 are new.
- In the second example, with \(N=10\), \(M=11\), \(K=2\), and \(L=4\), it correctly identifies that it is impossible to have unique coins from each friend since there are only 10 types of coins available.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and handles all edge cases as per the problem description, it is correct.
