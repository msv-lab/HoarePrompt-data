Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of friends \( M \) is greater than the total number of unique coins \( N \), but the number of new coins \( L \) required exceeds the remaining unique coins after accounting for the ones Ivan already has. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
20 15 2 18
```
- \( N = 20 \) (total unique coins)
- \( M = 15 \) (number of friends)
- \( K = 2 \) (coins Ivan already has)
- \( L = 18 \) (new coins required)

In this case, \( N - K + 1 = 18 \) (remaining unique coins after accounting for the ones Ivan already has). Since \( M = 15 \) and \( L = 18 \), it is impossible to give \( L \) unique coins because there are only 18 unique coins available and \( M \) is less than \( L \).

However, the program prints `1` because it checks if \( M \geq N - K + 1 \) and \( M \geq L \) separately without considering the combined constraints. This leads to an incorrect output in this scenario.
