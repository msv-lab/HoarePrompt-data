Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals is 1. If the GCD is 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second after switching them on. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This approach works because if the GCD of the intervals is 1, it means that the intervals are coprime, and thus their linear combinations can cover all positive integers, ensuring that at least one garland is lit every second after a certain point. If the GCD is greater than 1, it means the intervals share a common factor, and it is impossible to cover all seconds with just these intervals.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and works correctly for all given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
