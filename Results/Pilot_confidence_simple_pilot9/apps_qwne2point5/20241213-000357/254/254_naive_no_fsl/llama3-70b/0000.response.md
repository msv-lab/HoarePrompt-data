Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution attempts to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) using the formula `lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))`, but this approach is incorrect. The LCM of three numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) should be calculated as `lcm(a, lcm(b, c))`, not as the product of the numbers divided by the product of their pairwise GCDs.

To illustrate why the provided solution is incorrect, consider the following example:

Input:
```
2 2 3
```

The expected output is "YES" because Mishka can choose \(x_1 = 1\), \(x_2 = 2\), and \(x_3 = 1\). The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., and the third — 1, 4, 7, 10, .... These cover all the seconds after the 2nd one.

However, the provided solution incorrectly calculates the LCM and prints "NO" for this input, which is not correct.

Additionally, consider another example:

Input:
```
4 2 3
```

The expected output is "NO" because there is no way to choose the moments of time to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. However, the provided solution incorrectly prints "YES" for this input.

Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, making it incorrect.
