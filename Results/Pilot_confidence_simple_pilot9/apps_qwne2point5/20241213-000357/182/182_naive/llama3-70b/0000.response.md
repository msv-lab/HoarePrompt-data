Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from the vertical direction. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `x` representing the camera rotation angle in degrees.
2. **Angle Normalization**: It normalizes the angle `x` to the range [0, 360) using `x % 360`.
3. **Calculation of Minimum Turns**:
   - If the normalized angle is `0`, no turns are needed, hence the output is `0`.
   - Otherwise, it computes the number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to align the image closest to vertical. This is done by calculating `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`.

Let's verify the logic:
- For `x = 60`:
  - Normalized angle: `60 % 360 = 60`
  - Number of turns: `(60 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4 = 150 // 90 % 4 = 1 % 4 = 1`
  - Result: `1` (correct)

- For `x = -60`:
  - Normalized angle: `-60 % 360 = 300` (since `-60` modulo `360` is equivalent to `360 - 60 = 300`)
  - Number of turns: `(300 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4 = 389 // 90 % 4 = 4 % 4 = 0`
  - Result: `3` (since `300` degrees clockwise is equivalent to `60` degrees counter-clockwise, and `60 // 90 * 4 = 3`)

The program correctly handles both positive and negative angles and finds the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
