Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical for both positive and negative input angles. Hereâ€™s why:

1. The program first normalizes the angle using `normalized_angle = x % 360`, ensuring the angle is within the range of 0 to 360 degrees.
2. It then calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to achieve the minimal deviation using `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`.

This approach handles both positive and negative angles correctly. For example:
- If the input is `60` degrees (clockwise), the normalized angle is `60`, and the number of turns required is `(360 - 60) // 90 % 4 = 3`.
- If the input is `-60` degrees (counter-clockwise), the normalized angle is `300` (since `-60 % 360` is `300`), and the number of turns required is `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 1`.

The program covers all possible cases and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
