Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for certain inputs. Specifically, the logic for counting the number of trailing zeroes in factorials is flawed. The program attempts to incrementally build the list of numbers `ans` where the factorial ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes, but it fails to handle the condition properly.

For instance, consider the input `m = 5`. According to the problem description, there should be no such positive integers `n` whose factorial ends with exactly 5 trailing zeroes. However, the program will not correctly handle this case and may return an incorrect output.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

- For `m = 5`, the program should output `0` because there is no `n` such that `n!` has exactly 5 trailing zeroes.
- Instead, the program may output a non-zero number or incorrect list of numbers, indicating it does not correctly handle this specific case.

Therefore, the program is not fully correct and hence the verdict is **False**.
