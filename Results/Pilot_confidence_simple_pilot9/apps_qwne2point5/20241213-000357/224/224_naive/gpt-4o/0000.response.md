Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program does not calculate the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \).

The provided solution calculates the factorial of \( n-1 \), which is not relevant to the problem. To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function \( f(p) \) works and find the permutations that maximize \( f(p) \). For instance, for \( n = 3 \), the maximum value of \( f(p) \) is 2, and there are 4 such permutations, which the program fails to compute.

A correct approach would involve understanding the structure of the permutations that achieve the maximum value of \( f(p) \) and counting them accordingly. The current implementation does not address this requirement.
