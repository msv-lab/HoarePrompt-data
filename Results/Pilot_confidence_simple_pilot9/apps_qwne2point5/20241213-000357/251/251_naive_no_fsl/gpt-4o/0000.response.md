Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible total volume of the special cake by using dynamic programming. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum volume that can be achieved by placing cakes in a way that respects the given constraints. The program reads the input, processes it, and calls `func_1` to compute the result. Given the problem constraints and examples, the implementation appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
