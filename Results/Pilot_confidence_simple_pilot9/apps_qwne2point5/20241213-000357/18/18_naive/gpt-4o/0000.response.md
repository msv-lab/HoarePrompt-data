Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `t` is greater than `n` but less than or equal to `n + k`. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the number of standing spectators after all initial spectators have stood up and started sitting down again.

For example, consider the input:
```
10 5 12
```

According to the problem description:
- At `t = 12`, the `12 - 5 = 7`-th spectator should sit down, and the number of standing spectators would be `5`.

However, the program will output `3` instead because it does not properly account for the cycle of standing and sitting spectators after all initial spectators have stood up.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the case where `t > n` by calculating the remaining standing spectators after the initial `n` spectators have stood up and started sitting down.
