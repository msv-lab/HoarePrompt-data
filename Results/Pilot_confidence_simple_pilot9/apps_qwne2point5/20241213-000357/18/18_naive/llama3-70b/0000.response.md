Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of spectators standing at time `t` based on the given rules. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators is simply `min(t, k)`. This is because up to time `n`, the first `t` spectators will be standing.
2. If `t` is greater than `n`, the pattern starts repeating after `n`. The formula `k - (t - n) % k` accounts for the periodic nature of the standing spectators. Specifically, `(t - n) % k` gives the relative position within the repeat cycle, and subtracting this from `k` gives the number of standing spectators.

This logic handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
