Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic:

1. For `t` values from 1 to `n`, the number of standing spectators is simply `min(t, k)`.
2. For `t` values greater than `n`, the program calculates the number of standing spectators using the formula `k - (t - n) % k`.

This logic matches the description provided in the problem statement. We can verify this by considering different scenarios:

- When `t <= n`, the number of standing spectators is indeed `min(t, k)`.
- When `t > n`, the program correctly calculates the number of standing spectators by accounting for the periodic nature of the wave.

Since the program handles all potential cases as described and the logic is consistent with the examples provided, the program is correct. Therefore, the output is `True`.
