Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to find the number of different weights of splits of a given number \( n \). However, the current implementation counts the number of divisors of \( n \), which is not related to the weights of splits.

For example, for \( n = 7 \):
- The correct answer should be 4 (as mentioned in the problem note: Weight 1: [7], Weight 2: [3, 3, 1], Weight 3: [2, 2, 2, 1], Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]).
- But the program incorrectly counts the number of divisors of 7, which is 2 (1 and 7).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
