Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over all possible integer coordinates within a specified range (-1000 to 1000) and calculating the time required to grill K or more pieces of meat. However, this approach has several issues:

1. **Range Limitation**: The program only considers integer coordinates between -1000 and 1000. This is too restrictive because the problem description allows for real number coordinates. By limiting the search space to integers, the program may miss the optimal solution if the optimal point lies between two integers.

2. **Precision Issues**: Even if the program found the optimal integer coordinates, the solution might still be suboptimal due to rounding errors. The problem requires the result to be accurate to within \(10^{-6}\), and using only integer coordinates may not achieve this precision.

3. **Efficiency Concerns**: The brute-force approach of checking all possible integer coordinates within a large range is computationally expensive and may not be efficient for larger inputs (up to \(N = 60\)).

To address these issues, a more sophisticated approach would be needed, such as using a continuous optimization method (e.g., gradient descent or other numerical optimization techniques) to find the optimal real-number coordinates.
