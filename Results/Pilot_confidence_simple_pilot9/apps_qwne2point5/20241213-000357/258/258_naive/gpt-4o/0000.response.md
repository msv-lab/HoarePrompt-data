Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a binary search approach, but it contains several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to check if a certain temperature `T` can satisfy the condition of having `K` or more pieces of meat ready. However, the logic inside the function is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of the optimal point `(mx, my)` and the subsequent count of ready pieces do not correctly implement the problem's requirement. The function does not properly account for the distances and the threshold `T`.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Edge Cases**: The function `func_2` performs a binary search to find the minimum time `T`. However, the implementation of the binary search is incomplete and does not handle all possible edge cases, such as when the lower bound `low` and upper bound `high` are very close but still do not converge to the exact solution.

3. **Incorrect Input Processing**: The way the input is processed in `func_3` can lead to issues if the input data is not split correctly. Although the current implementation seems to work, it is not robust enough to handle all possible edge cases, especially if the input data format is slightly different.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the sample input:
```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```

The correct output should be `2.4`, which represents the time required to have 3 or more pieces of meat ready by placing the heat source optimally. However, due to the flawed logic in `func_1` and `func_2`, the program may not converge to the correct solution or may return an incorrect value.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
