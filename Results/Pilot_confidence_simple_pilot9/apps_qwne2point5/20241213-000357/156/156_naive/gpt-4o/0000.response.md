Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates Lara's current position after she has moved \(k\) times according to the specified rules. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Movement Down**: Lara first moves from \((1, 1)\) to \((n, 1)\). This covers \(n - 1\) steps.
2. **Subsequent Movement**: After reaching \((n, 1)\), Lara moves in a snake-like pattern:
   - Moves right along the bottom row until the end.
   - Moves up one row and to the left to the second column.
   - Repeats this pattern.

The program handles these movements correctly:
- It first checks if \(k\) is less than \(n - 1\). If so, it directly outputs the position \((k + 1, 1)\).
- Otherwise, it subtracts \(n - 1\) from \(k\) to account for the initial downward movement.
- It then calculates the number of full rows moved (\(full\_rows\)) and the remaining steps (\(remaining\_steps\)).
- Depending on whether \(full\_rows\) is even or odd, it correctly determines the row and column.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly identifies Lara's position for any valid input \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). Therefore, the program is correct.
