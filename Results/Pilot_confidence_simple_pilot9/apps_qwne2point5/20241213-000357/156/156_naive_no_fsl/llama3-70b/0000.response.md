Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is exactly equal to `n * 2 - 2`. According to the problem description, when `k` reaches this value, Lara should be in cell (1, 2). However, the program does not account for this specific scenario, leading to incorrect output for this case.

For example, if the input is:
```
4 3 7
```
The expected output is:
```
3 2
```
But the program outputs:
```
1 2
```
This is because the program incorrectly assumes that `k < n * 2 - 2` when `k` is actually equal to `n * 2 - 2`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
