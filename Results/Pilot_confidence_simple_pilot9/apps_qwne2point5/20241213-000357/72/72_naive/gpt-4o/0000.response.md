Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum, minimum, and the specific number of times Sergei was asked based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Full Cycle Length Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the length of a full cycle which alternates between moving down and up the rows.

2. **Initial Calculations for Full Cycles**: It correctly determines the number of full cycles and the remaining questions after completing those cycles.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the special case when `n` is 1 (a single row).

4. **Sergeiâ€™s Position Handling**: The logic for calculating how many times Sergei was asked is correct. It considers his position in both the row and the overall cycle structure.

5. **Remaining Questions Handling**: The program correctly processes the remaining questions and updates the counts accordingly.

Given the complexity of the problem and the thorough handling of different scenarios, including edge cases and the alternating row traversal, the provided solution seems to cover all necessary cases as per the problem description.
