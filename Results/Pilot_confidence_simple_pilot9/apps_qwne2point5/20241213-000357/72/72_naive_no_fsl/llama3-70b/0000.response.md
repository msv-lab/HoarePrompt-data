Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the total number of questions `k` is not sufficient to complete even one full cycle of asking all pupils. Specifically, the calculation of `max_asked` and `min_asked` assumes that the teacher will ask enough pupils to complete at least one full cycle, but this is not necessarily true.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1 3 2 1 1
```
- Here, `n = 1`, `m = 3`, `k = 2`, `x = 1`, and `y = 1`.
- According to the problem description, the teacher will ask the first pupil in the first row twice.
- However, the program calculates `max_asked` as `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) = (2 + 0) // 2 = 1`, which is incorrect because the first pupil should be asked twice.
- The correct output should be `2 2 2`, but the program outputs `1 1 1`.

This case demonstrates that the program does not handle the scenario where `k` is less than the number of pupils in a full cycle, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
