Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a golden ticket can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` iterates over possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`.
2. For each segment length, it calculates the target sum needed for each segment.
3. It then checks if the ticket can be split into segments with this target sum.
4. The `segment_sum` function correctly computes the sum of digits in a specified range.

By iterating over all possible segment lengths and checking for valid splits, the program ensures that all potential cases are covered. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or specific input where the program would fail based on the given logic and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
