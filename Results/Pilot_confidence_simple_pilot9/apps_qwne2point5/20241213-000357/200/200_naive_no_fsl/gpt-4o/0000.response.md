Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where it is not possible to distribute the kvass such that the minimum keg volume is maximized while meeting the requirement of pouring exactly `s` liters. Specifically, the logic for adjusting the minimum keg volume after distributing the required kvass is flawed. 

Consider the following input:
```
3 7
1 2 3
```

The program will output `-1`, which is correct because it is impossible to pour 7 liters of kvass with only 6 liters available in total. However, the program does not account for scenarios where it is possible to meet the requirement but the distribution logic is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that after distributing the `s` liters, the minimum keg volume is calculated correctly. The current logic may incorrectly reduce the minimum keg volume if there are remaining liters that could not be fully distributed due to insufficient capacity in the other kegs. This can lead to an incorrect minimum keg volume.
