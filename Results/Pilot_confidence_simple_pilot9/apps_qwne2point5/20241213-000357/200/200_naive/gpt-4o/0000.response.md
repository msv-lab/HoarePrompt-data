Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the sum of the differences between each keg's volume and the minimum keg volume is less than the required `s` liters. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the least keg has the maximum possible amount of kvass while still meeting the requirement of `s` liters in total.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 5
5 5 5 5
```

According to the problem description, the Fair Nut wants to pour his glass by 5 liters of kvass, and each keg initially has 5 liters. The goal is to maximize the kvass in the least keg. The correct output should be 3 because the Fair Nut can take 2 liters from each keg except the least one, making the least keg have 3 liters. However, the program will output 5, which is incorrect because it does not reduce the kvass in the other kegs to achieve the maximum in the least keg.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
        return

    min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
    remaining_kvass = s
    for i in range(n):
        if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
            continue
        else:
            possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
            remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
        if remaining_kvass == 0:
            break

    # Ensure the remaining kvass is distributed among the kegs to maximize the minimum volume
    if remaining_kvass > 0:
        min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n

    print(min_keg_volume)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the remaining kvass is distributed among the kegs to maximize the kvass in the least keg, thereby meeting the problem requirements.
