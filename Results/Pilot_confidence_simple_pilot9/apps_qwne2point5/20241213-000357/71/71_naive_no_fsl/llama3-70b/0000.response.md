Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the input number `n` ends with fewer than `k` trailing zeros. Specifically, consider the input:

```
10203040 2
```

The program should output `1` because we can remove the digit `3` to make the number `102040`, which is divisible by \(10^2 = 100\). However, the current implementation will incorrectly output `3` because it will keep removing digits until the last non-zero digit is encountered, without considering the requirement to make the number divisible by \(10^k\).

To fix this, the program needs to count the trailing zeros and remove them until the remaining number is divisible by \(10^k\), or remove digits from the beginning if necessary.
