Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the input number `n` ends with fewer than `k` trailing zeros. Specifically, consider the input:

**Input**
```
10203040 2
```

**Expected Output**
```
2
```

**Actual Output**
```
0
```

The program mistakenly counts the removal of all digits except the leading '1' as correct, but it should count the removal of at least two digits ('3', '0') to make the number divisible by \(10^2 = 100\). This shows that the program fails to handle cases where the number of trailing zeros is less than `k`.
