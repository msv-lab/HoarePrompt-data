Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required to verify the conditions specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Starting from the North Pole**: The initial latitude (`curr_lat`) is set to 90, which represents the North Pole.
2. **Validating Directions**: The program checks if Limak is at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`) and ensures he only moves South, or if he is at the South Pole (`curr_lat == -90`) and ensures he only moves North.
3. **Ending at the North Pole**: After processing all movements, the program checks if the final latitude is 90 (North Pole).
4. **Latitude Boundaries**: The program ensures that Limak's latitude remains within the valid range (-90 to 90).

Given these checks, the program correctly handles all potential cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
