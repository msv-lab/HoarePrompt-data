Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that if Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move South. Specifically, the program allows Limak to move in any direction if he is already at the North Pole, which violates the problem description. For example, consider the following input:

```
2
20000 South
10 East
```

In this case, after moving 20000 kilometers South from the North Pole, Limak should be at the South Pole. However, moving 10 kilometers East from the South Pole is allowed by the program, but this is not valid according to the problem description since he cannot move away from the South Pole once he reaches it. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description.
