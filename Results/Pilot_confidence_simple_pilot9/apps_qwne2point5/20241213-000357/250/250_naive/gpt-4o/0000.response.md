Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic to determine if `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks and potential new marks is flawed.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3 250 185 230
0 20 250
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
230
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will incorrectly output `0`, suggesting no additional marks are needed. However, adding a mark at 230 cm would allow measuring both 185 and 230 cm.

The issue lies in the way the program checks for the presence of `x` and `y` or their combinations in the set of marks. It does not properly account for all possible ways to form `x` and `y` using the existing marks and potential new marks. The current implementation may miss some valid combinations.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to ensure that for each required distance (`x` and `y`), there exists either a direct match or a combination of existing marks that can form the required distance. Additionally, the logic to add new marks should consider all possible valid placements.
