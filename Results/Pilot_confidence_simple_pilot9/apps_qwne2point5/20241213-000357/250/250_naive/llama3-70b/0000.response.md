Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to account for scenarios where the required additional marks can be derived from existing marks and the values of \(x\) and \(y\).

Consider the following input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

Expected output:
```
1
230
```

The program will output:
```
1
230
```

This seems correct, but consider this input:
```
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250
```

Expected output:
```
0
```

The program will output:
```
1
230
```

In this case, the program incorrectly adds an extra mark (230) even though the marks 20 and 185 can be combined to form the required distance of 230 (185 + 20 - 20 = 230).

To correctly solve this problem, the program should check all possible sums of existing marks and the required distances \(x\) and \(y\), and ensure that no redundant marks are added.
