Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total number of cake pieces `a + b` is less than the number of plates `n`. In such a scenario, it is impossible to distribute the pieces such that each plate gets at least one piece of cake from either the first or the second cake. However, the current implementation does not check this condition and will still attempt to distribute the pieces, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 1 1
```
Here, there are 3 plates but only 2 pieces of cake. According to the problem description, it should be impossible to distribute the pieces such that each plate gets at least one piece. However, the current program will incorrectly output `1`, which is not correct.

To fix this, we need to add a check at the beginning of the `func_1` function to ensure that `a + b` is at least `n` before proceeding with the binary search.
