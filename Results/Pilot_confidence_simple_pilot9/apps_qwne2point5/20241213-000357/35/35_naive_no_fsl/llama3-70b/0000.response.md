Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total number of pieces of cakes is less than the number of plates. Specifically, the condition `x = min(n, a, b)` is not sufficient to ensure that the distribution of pieces meets the requirement that each plate must contain at least `x` pieces of cake. For example, consider the input `3 2 2`. According to the problem description, the output should be `2` because each plate can have 2 pieces of cake (one from each cake). However, the current implementation would return `1` because `min(3, 2, 2) = 2`, and the loop condition would allow `x` to decrease to `1`.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
- Input: `3 2 2`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Program Output: `1`

Thus, the program is incorrect.
