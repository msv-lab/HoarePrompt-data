Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the smallest possible frame is not sufficient to enclose all white pixels. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3 7
w....w.
.......
.......
```

The expected output would be:
```
w+++.w.
++.+.+.
++.+.+.
```

However, the current implementation will incorrectly return `-1` because it checks if the height and width of the frame are both at least 2 before attempting to draw the frame, even though a smaller frame of size 1x1 could enclose all the white pixels if placed appropriately. The current implementation fails to consider this scenario, leading to an incorrect result for this case.
