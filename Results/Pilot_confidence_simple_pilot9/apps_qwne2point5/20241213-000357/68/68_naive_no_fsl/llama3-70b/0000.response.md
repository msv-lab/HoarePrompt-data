Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all the given conditions and potential edge cases as per the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Case 1:** When \(x > y + z\), the program prints `+` which is correct because even if all the unknown votes (`z`) go to downvotes, the total upvotes will still be greater than downvotes.
2. **Case 2:** When \(x < y\), the program prints `-` which is correct because even if all the unknown votes (`z`) go to upvotes, the total downvotes will still be greater than upvotes.
3. **Case 3:** When \(x = y\):
   - If \(z = 0\), the program prints `0` which is correct because there are equal upvotes and downvotes with no unknown votes, resulting in a tie.
   - If \(z > 0\), the program prints `?` which is correct because the outcome depends on how the unknown votes are cast, making the result uncertain.
4. **Case 4:** For other scenarios where the conditions do not match the above cases, the program prints `?` indicating uncertainty, which is correct.

Since the program handles all the described cases and edge cases correctly, the program is **correct**.
