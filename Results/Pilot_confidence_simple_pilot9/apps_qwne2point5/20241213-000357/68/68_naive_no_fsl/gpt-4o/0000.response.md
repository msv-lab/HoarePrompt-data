Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, consider the following input:

Input
```
2 1 1
```

According to the problem description, with `x = 2`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`:
- If the unknown voter upvotes, the total upvotes will be `2 + 1 = 3` and downvotes will be `1`. The result is `+`.
- If the unknown voter downvotes, the total upvotes will be `2` and downvotes will be `1 + 1 = 2`. The result is `-`.

Since the result depends on the action of the unknown voter, the result is uncertain. However, the provided program does not account for this uncertainty and will incorrectly print `?` for this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
