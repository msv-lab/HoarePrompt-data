Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to produce the lexicographically largest sequence when there are multiple valid sequences with the minimum maximum value. Consider the following example:

Input:
```
23 5
```

Expected Output:
```
Yes
3 3 2 1 0
```

However, the program's output for this input is:
```
No
```

This happens because the program breaks out of the loop as soon as `n` becomes zero or less, which is too early in this case. It fails to check all possible ways to distribute the bits of `n` into `k` elements, especially when multiple bits can be used to form the desired sequence.

A correct approach would involve ensuring that all possible distributions of the bits of `n` into `k` elements are considered, and then selecting the lexicographically largest sequence among those that have the minimum maximum value.
