Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when `n` is very small and `k` is large. Let's consider the following case:

- Input: `1 10`
- Expected Output: `No` (since it's impossible to represent `1` as the sum of 10 powers of 2)

However, the current implementation will attempt to create a list of 10 elements, which is not possible since the maximum value for `n` is `10^18` and the only way to represent `1` as a power of 2 is with `-1`. The program does not check if it's possible to form the required sum with the given `k`, leading to incorrect outputs in such cases.
