You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            print('No')
        else:
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
