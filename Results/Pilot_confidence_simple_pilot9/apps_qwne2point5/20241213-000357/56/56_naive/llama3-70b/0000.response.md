Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the required sum `n` cannot be achieved with exactly `k` integers. Specifically, the program does not check if the remaining value after decomposing `n` into the largest possible powers of 2 can still form a valid sequence of length `k`.

For example, consider the input:
```
23 4
```
The correct output should be:
```
No
```
because it is impossible to express 23 as the sum of four powers of 2. However, the provided program will attempt to decompose 23 into powers of 2 and then truncate the result to a length of 4, which will incorrectly produce a sequence.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the remaining value after decomposition can be represented by a valid sequence of length `k`. If not, it should output "No".
