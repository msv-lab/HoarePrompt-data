Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a pair (a, b) is good. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to calculate the GCD and LCM, but these calculations alone do not guarantee that the pair (a, b) is good according to the definition provided in the problem description. 

For instance, consider the input `l = 1`, `r = 10`, `x = 2`, and `y = 8`. The program will iterate through all possible pairs (a, b) within the range [1, 10] and check if their GCD equals 2 and their LCM equals 8. However, the program does not ensure that the product of a and b divided by their GCD equals their LCM. This can be seen in the pair (2, 8), which has a GCD of 2 and an LCM of 8, but the program would not correctly identify this pair as valid because it does not perform the necessary validation step.

To fix this, the program should include a check that ensures the relationship \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \) holds true. Without this check, the program may incorrectly count pairs that do not satisfy the condition.
