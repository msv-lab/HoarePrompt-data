Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input string `s` has more than one unrecognized nucleotide ('?') but still allows the possibility of decoding the genome such that the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are equal. However, the program does not check if the total number of unknown nucleotides exceeds the capacity to balance the counts. For instance, consider the input:

```
Input:
8
AA??GGTT
```

In this case, the program will attempt to replace the two unknown nucleotides but might fail to ensure that the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are exactly equal. The program should also ensure that if the number of unknown nucleotides is more than the difference between the maximum and minimum counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', it should print "===" instead of attempting to decode. This specific case is not handled correctly by the provided program.
