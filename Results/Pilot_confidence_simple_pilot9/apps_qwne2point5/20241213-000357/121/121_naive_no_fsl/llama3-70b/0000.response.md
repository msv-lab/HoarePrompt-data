Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly decodes the genome by replacing '?' characters with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each type of nucleotide appears equally often. Hereâ€™s a detailed reasoning:

1. **Counting Known Nucleotides**: The program first counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the given string `s`.
2. **Calculating Required Counts**: It calculates the required number of each type of nucleotide (`avg`) which is `n // 4`.
3. **Replenishing '?' with Missing Types**: For each '?', the program finds and replaces it with the first available type from 'ACGT'.
4. **Validation**: After attempting to decode the genome, it checks if all nucleotide counts match the required average. If not, it prints '==='; otherwise, it prints the decoded string.

Given the constraints and examples, this approach ensures that if a valid decoding exists, it will be found and printed. If no valid decoding is possible, '===' is printed, meeting the problem requirements accurately. Therefore, the program works correctly for all described cases.
