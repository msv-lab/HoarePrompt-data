Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to maintain the required ratio of 1:2:4. The logic in the program is sound:

1. It reads the number of lemons, apples, and pears as input.
2. It determines the maximum number of sets of fruits (each set containing 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears) that can be formed using `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.
3. It calculates the total number of fruits that can be used based on the number of sets and prints the result.

This approach ensures that the program works correctly for all valid inputs within the specified constraints. There are no edge cases that the provided code fails to handle, as it correctly limits the number of fruits used to the smallest possible quantity that maintains the required ratio. Therefore, the program is correct.
