Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game's algorithm. Specifically, the program directly interprets the binary representation of `n-1` as a sequence of moves without considering the skipping logic and backtracking rules described in the problem statement. For example, consider the input `(3, 6)`:

- According to the problem, the correct path would be `LRLL`, which visits nodes `0, 1, 3, 6`. However, the program incorrectly calculates the path as `011`, visiting nodes `0, 1, 3`, resulting in `visited_count = 3`.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not fully implement the game's algorithm, hence it is incorrect.
