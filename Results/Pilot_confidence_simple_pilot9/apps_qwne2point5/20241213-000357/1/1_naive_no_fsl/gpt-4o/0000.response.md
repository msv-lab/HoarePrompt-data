Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple colons between the opening and closing brackets, which violates the requirement that there should be exactly two colons with vertical lines in between. For example, consider the input `|[:::|]`. The program will incorrectly output `7` instead of `-1`, as there are more than two colons, making it impossible to form a valid accordion.
