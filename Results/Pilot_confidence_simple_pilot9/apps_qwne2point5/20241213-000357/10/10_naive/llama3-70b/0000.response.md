Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the sofa that matches the given conditions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the necessary inputs correctly and stores the sofa coordinates in a list.
2. **Condition Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of sofas to the left (`left`), right (`right`), top (`top`), and bottom (`bottom`) of each sofa.
3. **Comparison and Output**: The program iterates through each sofa and compares the calculated conditions with the given conditions (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`). If a match is found, it prints the index of the sofa (plus one) and breaks out of the loop. If no match is found, it prints `-1`.

The logic for calculating the conditions in `func_1` is sound:
- For each sofa, it checks the other sofas to determine the count of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom.
- The comparisons are made correctly based on the given problem description.

Given the provided examples and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There are no obvious flaws or edge cases that the program does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
