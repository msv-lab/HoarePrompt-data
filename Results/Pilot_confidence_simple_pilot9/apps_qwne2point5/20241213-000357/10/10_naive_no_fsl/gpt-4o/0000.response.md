Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where multiple sofas can share the same pair of cells, which is a critical point in the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if a sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of another sofa based on the coordinates of the cells they cover. However, it does not ensure that no cell is covered by more than one sofa, which is explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
2
3 2
3 1 3 2
2 1 2 2
1 0 0 1
```

In this case, the program should not count the second sofa as being to the left of the first sofa because the cells (2, 1) and (2, 2) are shared. The correct solution should account for this by ensuring that each cell is only counted once for each condition.

To fix this, you would need to modify the program to properly check the conditions while respecting the constraint that no cell is covered by more than one sofa.
