Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to jump from the beginning to the end of the string, landing only on vowels. The logic in the `func_1` function iterates through the string, tracking the maximum distance between consecutive vowels and updating the maximum jump accordingly. This ensures that the program handles all potential cases where the string may contain any combination of vowels and consonants, as well as strings of varying lengths up to 100 characters. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
