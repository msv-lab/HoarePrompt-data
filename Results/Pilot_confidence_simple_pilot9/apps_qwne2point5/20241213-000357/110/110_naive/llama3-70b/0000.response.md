Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. The logic in the program simply calculates the minimum of `k` and the total number of possible positions for the scoop-net, which is incorrect. This calculation does not take into account the optimal placement of the fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

For instance, consider the following input:

Input
```
3 3 2 3
```

The correct output should be `2.0000000000`, but the program outputs `1.0000000000`. This is because the program incorrectly assumes that placing the fishes in any available positions will give the highest expected value, which is not true.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to place the fishes in such a way that each possible position of the scoop-net captures at least one fish. The optimal strategy involves placing the fishes in the cells that are most frequently covered by the scoop-net positions. For a given `r x r` scoop-net on an `n x m` pond, the best strategy is to place the fishes in cells that are in the center region of the pond, ensuring maximum overlap with scoop-net positions. However, the provided solution does not implement this logic.
