Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to ensure that it is impossible to form a square. Specifically, the program does not check that the four parts cannot all be equal. For example, if `n = 8`, the program would incorrectly count `{2, 2, 2, 2}` as a valid way to cut the stick, which is not allowed since it forms a square. The program should exclude cases where all four parts are equal.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check that the four parts are not all equal. Here is an updated version of the program that includes this check:

```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a, n // 2 + 1):
            rem = n - (a + b)
            if rem > 0 and rem >= b and a != b and rem != b:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This updated version ensures that the four parts are not all equal, thus correctly implementing the problem's requirements.
