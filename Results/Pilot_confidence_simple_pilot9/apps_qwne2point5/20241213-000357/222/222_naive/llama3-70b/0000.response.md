Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, it assumes that the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers is always \((n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)\), which is not always accurate. For instance, consider the case where \(n = 5\) and \(k = 1\):

- According to the problem, the optimal solution would be to turn over skewers 1 and 4, which requires 2 actions.
- However, the program calculates \((5 + 1 - 1) // (1 * 2 + 1) = 5 // 3 = 1\), suggesting only 1 action is needed, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the program generates the list of skewers to be turned based on a simple arithmetic sequence, which does not guarantee the minimum number of actions in all cases. Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements for certain inputs.
