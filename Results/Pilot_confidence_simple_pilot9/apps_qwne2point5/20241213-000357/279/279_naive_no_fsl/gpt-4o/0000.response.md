Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to ensure that each skewer visits all 2n placements. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the number of components that do not require any reversal (i.e., `no_reverse_components`). 

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
4
1 2 3 4
1 0 0 0
```

According to the problem description, we need to find the minimum number of changes (in the permutation `p` and/or the sequence `b`) so that each skewer visits all 2n placements. For the given input, the permutation is already a valid permutation, and the sequence `b` indicates that the first skewer should be reversed. However, the current implementation incorrectly counts this scenario as needing no changes.

The correct approach involves checking if any component (cycle) in the permutation can be made to visit all 2n placements with the minimum number of changes. The provided program does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
