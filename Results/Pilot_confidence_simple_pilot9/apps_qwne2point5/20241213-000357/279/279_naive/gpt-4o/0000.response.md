Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, it does not handle the requirement that each skewer must visit every of its 2n placements. The program attempts to count the number of cycles in the permutation and check if all elements in a cycle are set to 0 in the sequence `b`. However, this approach does not ensure that each skewer visits every possible placement in both directions.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2 3 1
0 0 0
```
According to the problem description, the output should be 1 because we only need to change one element in `b` to ensure that each skewer visits every placement. However, the provided program does not produce the correct output. It will incorrectly print 0 because all elements in the cycle are set to 0.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to ensure that each skewer visits every possible placement in both directions. This requires a different approach, such as ensuring that the permutation and the sequence `b` allow each skewer to traverse all 2n placements. The current implementation does not guarantee this, hence it is incorrect.
