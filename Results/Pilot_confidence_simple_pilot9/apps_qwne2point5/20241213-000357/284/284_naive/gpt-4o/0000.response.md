Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements a solution to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. The program iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If a non-prime number is found, it prints the value of \( m \) and exits the loop. 

The `func_1` function accurately determines whether a number is prime by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is a standard efficient method for prime testing.

Given the constraints and guarantees that the answer exists within the specified range, the program will always find a valid \( m \) and terminate successfully. Thus, the program works correctly for every potential case as described in the problem statement.
