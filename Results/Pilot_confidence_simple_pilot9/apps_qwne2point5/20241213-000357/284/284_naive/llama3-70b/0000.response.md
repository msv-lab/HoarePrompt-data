Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. It checks for each \( m \) from 1 to 1000 whether \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If it finds a non-prime number, it prints the corresponding \( m \) and stops. The function `func_1` accurately determines whether a number is prime by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number, ensuring correctness for the given range. Since the problem guarantees that the answer exists within the specified range, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \).
