Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to evaluate all 12 possible expressions and determine which one has the maximum value. It then prints the corresponding expression in the required format. Given the constraints and the examples provided, the program handles all potential cases correctly. The use of `map(float, input().split())` ensures that the inputs are treated as floating-point numbers, and the list of expressions is evaluated using the `max` function with a custom key to compare their values. This approach ensures that the program works for any valid input within the specified range and formats the output as required.
