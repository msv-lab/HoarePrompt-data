Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic used to determine if the sum of a pair of shovels ends with the maximum possible number of nines is flawed. 

For instance, consider the input `n = 50`. According to the problem description, the optimal pair would be shovels 49 and 50, since their total cost is 99, which ends with the maximum number of nines (2). However, the current implementation checks if the sum of each pair modulo 10^(number of digits - 1) equals 0, which does not always identify the correct pairs.

A counterexample is `n = 50`. The program would not correctly identify the pair (49, 50) as one of the valid pairs, because it uses the length of the string representation of the sum to determine the modulus, rather than finding the highest power of 10 that the sum can end with.

To fix this, the program should identify the highest power of 10 that the sum can end with and check if the sum modulo that value is zero. This would correctly identify the pairs that end with the maximum number of nines.
