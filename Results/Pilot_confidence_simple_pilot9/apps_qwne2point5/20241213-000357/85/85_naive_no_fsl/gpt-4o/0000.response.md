Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the program calculates `max_9s` as the number of trailing zeros in `(n + 1)`, but this approach does not accurately determine the maximum number of nines at the end of the sum of two shovels' costs.

For instance, consider the input `n = 50`. According to the problem description, the optimal pair to choose is the 49th and 50th shovels, since their total cost is 99, ending with two nines. However, the program would incorrectly calculate `max_9s` as 0 (since `(50 + 1) % 10 != 0`), leading to an incorrect result of 1 instead of the correct answer of 1.

A correct solution would involve finding the maximum number of nines that can be achieved by considering the properties of the sum of two integers from 1 to n. This typically involves more complex mathematical analysis and might require checking pairs to find the maximum number of trailing nines in their sum.
