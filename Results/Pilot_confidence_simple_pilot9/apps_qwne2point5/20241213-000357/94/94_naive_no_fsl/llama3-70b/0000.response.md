Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. Specifically, the program swaps the positions of the empty cells between the two puzzles and then checks if the sorted strings of the puzzles are equal. This approach is flawed because:

1. Swapping the empty cells does not simulate a valid move in the puzzle. A valid move involves sliding a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell.
2. Even if the sorted strings are equal after swapping the empty cells, it does not guarantee that the puzzles can be brought to the same configuration through a series of valid moves.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to generate all possible configurations of the puzzles by performing valid moves and check if any of these configurations match. The current implementation does not simulate the sliding of tiles and only checks if the sorted strings are equal after an invalid operation.
