Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over all possible values of \( t \) from 1 to 100 and calculates the cost of making all sticks almost good for each \( t \). It then selects the \( t \) with the minimum cost and prints both \( t \) and the minimum cost. Since the program handles all given examples and potential cases within the constraints, it is correct.
