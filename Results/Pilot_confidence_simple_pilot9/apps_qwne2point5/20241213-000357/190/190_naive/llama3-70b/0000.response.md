Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the median value `mid` might not be the optimal choice for `t`. The program always sets `t` to the median value `mid` and calculates the cost based on this assumption. However, the optimal `t` could be either `mid`, `mid - 1`, or `mid + 1`.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
Input:
4
1 1 2 3
```

The program will set `t` to the median value `1.5`, which is not a valid integer. It will calculate the cost based on `t = 1` and `t = 2` and return the minimum cost and corresponding `t`. However, the optimal solution here is `t = 2`, as all sticks can be changed to lengths almost good for `t = 2` with a total cost of `0`.

The correct approach would be to check the costs for `t = mid`, `t = mid - 1`, and `t = mid + 1` and return the minimum cost along with the corresponding `t`. The provided code does not account for this and may fail in cases where the median value is not the optimal choice.
