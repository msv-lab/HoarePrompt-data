Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. The logic of tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight each year, and incrementing the year counter until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's, accurately follows the problem description. The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), as demonstrated by the examples provided. There are no edge cases identified where the program fails to meet the requirements.
