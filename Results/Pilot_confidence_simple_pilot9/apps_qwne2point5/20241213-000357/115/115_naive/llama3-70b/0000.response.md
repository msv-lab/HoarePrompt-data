Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not fully implement the logic required to transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \). Specifically, the program only checks if certain elements in the matrix \( A \) are `1` and adds an operation to the list if any of the four corners of a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are `1`. However, this approach fails to ensure that all necessary \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices are turned into `1`s if they should be according to the final state of matrix \( A \).

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

The expected output would be `-1` because it is impossible to achieve the desired transformation using the allowed operations. However, the current implementation might incorrectly output a sequence of operations, which is not valid.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that every \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix that should end up being all `1`s has been operated on, regardless of whether the initial configuration allows it to be achieved through the given operations.
