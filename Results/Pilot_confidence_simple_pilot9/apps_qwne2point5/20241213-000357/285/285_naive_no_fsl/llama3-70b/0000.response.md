Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins by buying houses, cars, and computers. The nested loops iterate over all possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to see if there exists a combination that satisfies the equation \(a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n\). If such a combination is found, it prints "YES" and exits. If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It uses a brute-force approach within reasonable bounds, given the constraints. Since the program iterates over all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it will correctly identify if it is possible to spend all `n` game-coins with the given prices. Therefore, the program is correct.
