Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that the solution always exists and uses a direct approach to find points, which might not cover all scenarios.

Consider the following input:
```
1 1 3
```

For this input:
- \( n = 1 \)
- \( m = 1 \)
- \( k = 3 \)

The required area of the triangle is \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{1 \times 1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\).

However, the program tries to find integer coordinates \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle they form is exactly \(\frac{1}{3}\). Given the constraints \(0 \le x_i, y_i \le 1\), the maximum area of any triangle formed by these points is \(\frac{1}{2}\) (which is the area of the triangle formed by \((0,0)\), \((1,0)\), and \((0,1)\)).

Since \(\frac{1}{3}\) is less than \(\frac{1}{2}\) but still greater than 0, and given the integer constraints, it is impossible to form a triangle with an area of exactly \(\frac{1}{3}\). Therefore, the program should output "NO" for this case.

However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly and prints "YES" along with coordinates, which are not valid for the given input.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this specific case, leading to the conclusion that the overall correctness is **False**.
