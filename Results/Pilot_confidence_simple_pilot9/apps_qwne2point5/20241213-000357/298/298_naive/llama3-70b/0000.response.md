Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( n \times m \) is not divisible by \( k \), which violates the problem statement. According to the problem description, if \( n \times m \% k \neq 0 \), the output should be "NO". However, the provided solution does not check this condition properly and can lead to incorrect outputs. For instance, if the input is `2 3 2`, the program will incorrectly print "YES" and coordinates, whereas the correct output should be "NO" since \( 2 \times 3 / 2 = 3 \) and there are no integer points that form a triangle with an area of 3.
