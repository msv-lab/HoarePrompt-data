Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that either \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\) or \(2 \times \text{area} \leq m\), which is not always true. This assumption leads to incorrect solutions in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the input \(n = 5\), \(m = 5\), and \(k = 5\):

- The area of the triangle should be \(\frac{5 \times 5}{5} = 5\).
- The program checks if \(2 \times 5 \leq n\) or \(2 \times 5 \leq m\), which is true.
- It prints the coordinates as follows:
  ```
  YES
  0 0
  10 1
  0 1
  ```

However, this set of coordinates does not form a valid triangle within the given constraints \(0 \le x_i \le n\) and \(0 \le y_i \le m\), because \(10 > 5\).

A correct approach would involve checking all possible configurations to ensure the points lie within the given bounds and form a valid triangle with the required area.
