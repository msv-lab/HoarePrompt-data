Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where there are no golden trophies ('G') in the sequence. In such a scenario, the program will still attempt to calculate the maximum possible beauty by performing a swap, which is unnecessary since the output should be 0. This oversight causes the program to fail for inputs where there are no golden trophies. For example, in the input "SSSS", the program incorrectly attempts to perform a swap and returns a value other than 0, which is incorrect according to the problem description.
