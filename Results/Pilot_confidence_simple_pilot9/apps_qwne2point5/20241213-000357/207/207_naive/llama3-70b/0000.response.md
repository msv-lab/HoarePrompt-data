Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the function \( f(i) \). Specifically, the logic for updating the dynamic programming array `dp` is flawed. The program incorrectly updates `dp[i + a]` and `dp[i - b]`, which does not ensure that each reachable position within the interval \([0, m]\) is properly counted.

For example, consider the input \( m = 7 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 3 \):

- For \( i = 0 \), the frog can only stay at 0, so \( f(0) = 1 \).
- For \( i = 1 \), the frog can only stay at 1, so \( f(1) = 1 \).
- For \( i = 2 \), the frog can only stay at 2, so \( f(2) = 1 \).
- For \( i = 3 \), the frog can only stay at 3, so \( f(3) = 1 \).
- For \( i = 4 \), the frog can only stay at 4, so \( f(4) = 1 \).
- For \( i = 5 \), the frog can jump to 0 or 2, so \( f(5) = 3 \).
- For \( i = 6 \), the frog can jump to 1 or 3, so \( f(6) = 3 \).
- For \( i = 7 \), the frog can jump to 2, 5, or 4, so \( f(7) = 5 \).

The correct values for \( f(i) \) are \( [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 5] \), and their sum is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 5 = 14 \), not 19.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each \( i \) from 0 to \( m \).
