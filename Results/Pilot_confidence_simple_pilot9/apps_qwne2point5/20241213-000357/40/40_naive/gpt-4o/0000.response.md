Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not work correctly because it relies on the existence of a function `func_1` which is not defined in the provided code. The function `func_1` is used to check if a substring is a palindrome, but it is never defined. This leads to a NameError when running the program.

To fix this, the definition of `func_1` needs to be added to the code. Here is the corrected version:

```python
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected for all cases described in the problem.
