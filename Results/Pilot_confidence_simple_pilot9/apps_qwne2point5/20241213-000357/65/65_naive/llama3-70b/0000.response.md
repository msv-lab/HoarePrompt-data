Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if Kefa can distribute the balloons such that no friend gets two balloons of the same color. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of balloons `n`, the number of friends `k`, and the string `s` representing the colors of the balloons.
2. It uses a dictionary `color_count` to count the occurrences of each balloon color.
3. It finds the maximum count of any single color (`max_color_count`).
4. If the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends `k`, it prints "YES" because Kefa can distribute the balloons without any friend getting two of the same color.
5. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

This logic ensures that the program works correctly for all given test cases and potential inputs. Since the program handles the distribution logic accurately and checks if the condition is met, it is correct according to the problem description.
