Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not take into account the requirement that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected lowercase letters. For example, consider the input:

```
Input:
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `2` for positions 6 and 8 or 7 and 8, as mentioned in the problem description. However, the program simply extracts all the positions of lowercase letters and prints their count, without checking for the presence of uppercase letters between them. This leads to incorrect results in cases where there are uppercase letters between the selected lowercase letters.
