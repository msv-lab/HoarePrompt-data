Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always achieve the maximum possible value of \(B - C\). Specifically, the program sorts the array in descending order and alternates between adding elements to \(b\) and \(c\). This approach does not necessarily maximize \(B - C\).

For example, consider the input:
```
4
-10 10 -5 5
```

The program would sort the array as \([10, 5, -5, -10]\) and then partition it as follows:
- \(b = [10, -5]\)
- \(c = [5, -10]\)

This results in:
- \(B = 10 + (-5) = 5\)
- \(C = 5 + (-10) = -5\)
- \(B - C = 5 - (-5) = 10\)

However, the optimal partitioning would be:
- \(b = [10, -5]\)
- \(c = [5, -10]\)

But since the program alternates based on index parity after sorting, it does not consider this optimal partitioning.

A correct solution would involve iterating through the elements and deciding which sequence (either \(b\) or \(c\)) to add each element to based on which would increase \(B - C\) more, without sorting.
