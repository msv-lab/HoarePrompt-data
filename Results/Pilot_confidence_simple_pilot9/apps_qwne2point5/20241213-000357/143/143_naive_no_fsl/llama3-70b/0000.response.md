Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program implements a dynamic programming solution to find the minimum cost to buy at least L liters of lemonade. It initializes a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to get exactly `i` liters of lemonade. The program iterates over each possible volume of bottles and updates the DP array accordingly. Finally, it outputs the cost to get at least `L` liters of lemonade.

This approach correctly handles all the examples given:
1. For the first example, the program calculates the minimum cost to get 12 liters of lemonade, which is 150 roubles.
2. For the second example, the program correctly identifies that buying one 8-liter bottle is cheaper than buying smaller bottles.
3. For the third example, the program correctly buys three 1-liter bottles for a total of 30 roubles.
4. For the fourth example, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for a large amount of lemonade.

Since the program correctly handles all the provided examples and the logic is sound, it is correct for every potential case described by the problem.
