You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input
4 3
10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input
4 3
10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input
5 787787787
123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
