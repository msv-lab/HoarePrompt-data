Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func` correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time `M`. Here's why:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum points that can be earned for each possible combination of subtasks solved within the given time `M`.
2. **Sorting Time Values**: The times `t` required to solve each subtask are sorted. This ensures that we consider the smallest time subtasks first, which is beneficial for maximizing the number of points.
3. **DP Table Initialization**: A 2D DP table `dp` is initialized to store the maximum points that can be earned up to each subtask and within each time limit.
4. **Filling DP Table**: The nested loops fill the DP table by considering whether to include the current subtask or skip it, updating the maximum points accordingly.
5. **Calculating Total Points**: Finally, the function calculates the total points by summing up the points from the DP table and adding the bonus points for completing all subtasks in a task.

Given the logic and implementation, the function appears to handle all potential cases correctly as per the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the function might fail to meet the requirements.
