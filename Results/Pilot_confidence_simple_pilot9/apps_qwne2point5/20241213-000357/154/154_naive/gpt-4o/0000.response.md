Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of points Polycarp can earn within M minutes. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the input and initializes variables appropriately.
2. **Total Time Calculation**: It calculates the total time required to complete one task (`total_time_per_task`).
3. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates over the possible number of complete tasks (`complete_tasks`), ensuring that the total time spent on completing these tasks does not exceed M.
4. **Points Calculation**: For each possible number of complete tasks, it calculates the points earned from completing those tasks (`points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)`).
5. **Remaining Time and Subtasks**: It then calculates how many additional subtasks can be solved within the remaining time (`remaining_time`), considering each subtask's time requirement (`subtask_time`).
6. **Subtask Limitation**: It ensures that the number of subtasks solved does not exceed the maximum possible subtasks for the remaining tasks (`min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`).
7. **Max Points Update**: Finally, it updates the `max_points` variable with the maximum value obtained so far.

Given the structure and logic of the program, it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
