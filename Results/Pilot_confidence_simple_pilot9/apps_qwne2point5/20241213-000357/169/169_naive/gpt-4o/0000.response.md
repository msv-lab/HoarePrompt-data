Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. The logic in the program iterates through each operation, increasing the count of stones for '+' and ensuring the count does not go below zero for '-' operations. This approach guarantees that the minimal possible number of stones is computed, as it starts from the minimum possible initial number of stones (0) and adjusts based on the operations. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly.
