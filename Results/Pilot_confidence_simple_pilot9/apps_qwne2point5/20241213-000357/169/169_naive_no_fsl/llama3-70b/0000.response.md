Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not consider the initial number of stones in the pile, which is crucial for determining the minimal possible number of stones after the operations. For instance, consider the input:

```
3
---
```

According to the problem description, if Vasya starts with 3 stones, the final number of stones would be 0. However, the program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' operations directly, which is incorrect. It assumes the pile starts with 0 stones, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program fails to handle cases where the initial number of stones is not zero.
