Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \(a\) and \(b\) are not coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is greater than 1). In such cases, the program incorrectly calculates the number of reachable integers within the interval \([0, m]\).

For example, consider the input \(m = 7, a = 4, b = 5\):

- The greatest common divisor of \(4\) and \(5\) is \(1\), so the program should work correctly.
- However, let's consider the case where \(m = 10, a = 6, b = 3\):
  - Here, \(g = \text{func\_1}(6, 3) = 3\).
  - The function should then call itself with \(m = 10 / 3 = 3\) (integer division), \(a = 6 / 3 = 2\), and \(b = 3 / 3 = 1\).
  - The function returns \((2 + 1 - 1) * (3 + 1) // 2 + (10 - (2 + 1 - 1)) * (10 + 1) // 2 - (2 + 1 - 1) * (2) // 2 = 3 + 55 - 3 = 55\).
  - But the correct answer should be \(f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 3, f(4) = 3, f(5) = 4, f(6) = 4, f(7) = 5, f(8) = 5, f(9) = 6, f(10) = 6\), which sums to \(38\).

Since the program does not correctly handle the case when \(a\) and \(b\) are not coprime, it is incorrect.
