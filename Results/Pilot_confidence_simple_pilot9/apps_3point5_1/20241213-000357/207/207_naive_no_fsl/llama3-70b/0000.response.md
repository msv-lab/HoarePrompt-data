Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime (i.e., \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\)). In such cases, the frog can theoretically reach any integer within the interval \([0, m]\), but the program may not correctly account for this due to its dynamic programming approach.

For example, consider the input:
```
10 3 2
```

- For \(i = 0\), \(f(0) = 1\).
- For \(i = 1\), the frog can only reach \(1\) (from \(0 + 1\)), so \(f(1) = 1\).
- For \(i = 2\), the frog can reach \(2\) (from \(0 + 2\)), so \(f(2) = 2\).
- For \(i = 3\), the frog can reach \(3\) (from \(0 + 3\)) and \(1\) (from \(2 - 1\)), so \(f(3) = 3\).
- For \(i = 4\), the frog can reach \(4\) (from \(0 + 4\)), \(2\) (from \(2 + 2\)), and \(2\) (from \(3 - 1\)), so \(f(4) = 4\).

Continuing this way up to \(i = 10\), the correct values would be:
- \(f(0) = 1\)
- \(f(1) = 1\)
- \(f(2) = 2\)
- \(f(3) = 3\)
- \(f(4) = 4\)
- \(f(5) = 5\)
- \(f(6) = 6\)
- \(f(7) = 7\)
- \(f(8) = 8\)
- \(f(9) = 9\)
- \(f(10) = 10\)

Thus, the correct sum would be \(1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55\).

However, the provided program does not correctly compute this and may produce incorrect results due to its limitations in handling all possible cases, especially when \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
