Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of \( f(i) \) for \( i \) from 0 to \( m \). Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **Recursive Division**: If the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \) is greater than 1, the program recursively divides \( m \), \( a \), and \( b \) by this GCD until the GCD is 1. This step ensures that the problem reduces to the simplest case where the GCD is 1.
3. **Base Case Handling**: When the GCD is 1, the program calculates \( k = a + b - 1 \). This value represents the maximum jump length the frog can achieve without jumping out of the interval [0, x].
4. **Sum Calculation**: For \( m < k \), the sum of all reachable positions up to \( m \) is straightforward and computed as \( \frac{(m + 1) \cdot (m + 2)}{2} \).
5. **General Case Handling**: For \( m \geq k \), the program calculates the sum of reachable positions up to \( k \) and subtracts the redundant part, then adds the remaining part to get the final sum.

Since the program handles all potential cases correctly based on the problem description, and no counterexample was found, the program is correct.
