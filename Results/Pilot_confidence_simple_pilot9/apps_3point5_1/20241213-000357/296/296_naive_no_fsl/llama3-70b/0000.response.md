Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that for any \( n > 2 \), a valid sequence of fractions can always be constructed by choosing \( k = 2 \), \( a_1 = 1 \), \( b_1 = \frac{n}{2} \), and \( a_2 = 1 \), \( b_2 = n \). However, this approach does not guarantee that the sum of the fractions will always equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

For instance, consider \( n = 4 \):
- The program would output:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 2
  1 4
  ```

However, the correct fractions should be:
- \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\) do not satisfy \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\).

Instead, the correct fractions for \( n = 4 \) would be:
- \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{6}\) because \(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{4}\).

Thus, the program fails to generate the correct sequence of fractions for certain values of \( n \), making it incorrect.
