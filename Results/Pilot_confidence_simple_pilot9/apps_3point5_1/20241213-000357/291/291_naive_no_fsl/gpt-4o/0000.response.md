Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the number of segments needed to draw `n` squares, but the formula used in the calculation is incorrect. The logic in the function does not accurately reflect the described behavior of drawing squares with minimal ruler usage.

To illustrate, consider the following cases:

1. **Input: 1**
   - According to the problem description, to draw 1 square, Sofia needs to draw 2 segments initially and then 2 more segments using the first 2 as guides. Therefore, the correct output should be `2`.
   - However, the program calculates the minimum segments needed incorrectly and outputs `2` for `n=1`, which is correct in this specific case but may fail for other values.

2. **Input: 2**
   - To draw 2 squares, according to the problem description, Sofia needs to draw 3 segments initially (using rulers for 1 segment each) and then 4 more segments using the initial segments as guides. Therefore, the correct output should be `3`.
   - However, the program calculates the minimum segments needed incorrectly and outputs `3` for `n=2`, which is also correct in this specific case but may fail for other values.

3. **Input: 4**
   - To draw 4 squares, according to the problem description, Sofia needs to draw 4 segments initially (using rulers for 2 segments each) and then 8 more segments using the initial segments as guides. Therefore, the correct output should be `4`.
   - However, the program calculates the minimum segments needed incorrectly and outputs `4` for `n=4`, which is correct in this specific case but may fail for other values.

While the provided program appears to work correctly for the given examples, it fails to handle all potential cases accurately. The formula used in the function `func_1` does not correctly minimize the number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler for any arbitrary value of `n`.

To correctly solve this problem, the logic should be re-evaluated to ensure it accurately reflects the described behavior.
