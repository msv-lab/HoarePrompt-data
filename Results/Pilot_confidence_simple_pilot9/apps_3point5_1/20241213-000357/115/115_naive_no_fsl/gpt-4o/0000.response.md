Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that if a $2 \times 2$ submatrix in $A$ is fully composed of $1$s, then those positions in $B$ will be set to $1$. However, this logic does not cover scenarios where $A$ has isolated $1$s that cannot be achieved by setting $2 \times 2$ submatrices.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```

In this case, the program will incorrectly return `0`, suggesting that no operations are needed. However, it is impossible to transform the initial matrix $B$ (which is filled with zeros) into the given matrix $A$ using the allowed operations, since there are no $2 \times 2$ submatrices that can produce the isolated $1$s in the input matrix.

Thus, the program fails to handle this specific case correctly, making it incorrect.
