Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly verify the path constraints. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if the Manhattan distance between consecutive cells in the path is exactly 1, which is correct. However, the main loop that searches for possible values of `x` and `y` does not correctly handle the path constraints. The loop iterates over all possible values of `x` and `y` up to 1000000, but it does not ensure that the path is valid for the given values of `x` and `y`. 

For example, consider the input:
```
8
1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2
```

The program will output `YES` and `3 3`, which is incorrect because the path `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 8 -> 5 -> 2` cannot be formed within a 3x3 matrix. The correct answer should be `NO`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that for each pair of consecutive cells in the path, the Manhattan distance is exactly 1, and also that the values of `x` and `y` are consistent with the given path. The current implementation does not guarantee this.
