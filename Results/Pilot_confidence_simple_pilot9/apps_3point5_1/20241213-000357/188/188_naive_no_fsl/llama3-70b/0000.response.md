Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where multiple numbers appear exactly `n//2` times, making the game fair for both players. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

In this case, the program should output "YES" and provide two distinct numbers (e.g., 1 and 2), but instead, it outputs "NO". This is incorrect because both 1 and 2 can be chosen by Petya and Vasya respectively, allowing them to each take 3 cards.

The program only checks for the first two numbers that appear exactly `n//2` times and breaks the loop after finding the second one. However, if there are more than two numbers appearing `n//2` times, the program fails to recognize the possibility of choosing any of those numbers.
