Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a pair of numbers that appear exactly `n/2` times in the list. However, this approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the game can be fair. The game can only be fair if each player can take exactly `n/2` cards, which means the numbers chosen by Petya and Vasya must be such that they can each take half of the cards without overlap. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```
In this case, the program would output "YES" because it finds that the numbers 1, 2, and 3 each appear twice (`n/2` times), but it does not check if Petya and Vasya can actually choose these numbers to take exactly half of the cards. Here, no matter which number Petya chooses, Vasya cannot choose a different number to take the remaining cards because there will always be an overlap.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that there are exactly two distinct numbers that appear the same number of times and that together they cover all `n` cards without overlap. The current implementation fails to check for this condition properly.
