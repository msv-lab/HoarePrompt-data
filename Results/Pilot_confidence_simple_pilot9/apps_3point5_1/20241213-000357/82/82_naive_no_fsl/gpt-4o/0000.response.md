Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle the problem correctly for all given examples and potential edge cases. Here's why:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **LCM Calculation**: The `func_2` function correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) using the relationship between GCD and LCM.
3. **K Value Search**: In `func_3`, the program iterates through potential values of `k` from 1 to the square root of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. This ensures that all possible values of `k` leading to the smallest LCM are considered efficiently.
4. **Optimal K Selection**: The program selects the smallest `k` that results in the minimum LCM, ensuring the correct answer is returned even when multiple `k` values yield the same LCM.

Given these points, the program should work correctly for all inputs within the specified constraints. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that the provided code fails to handle.
