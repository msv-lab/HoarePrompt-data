Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total volume of kvass in the kegs is less than the required amount `s`. In such a scenario, the program will incorrectly set the lower bound (`low`) to the minimum volume in the kegs without checking if it is sufficient to meet the requirement `s`. This can lead to an incorrect result of `-1` being printed when it should be the actual minimum volume that can be achieved in the least keg.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 8
1 2 3
```
The program will output `-1`, but the correct output should be `2`, as the Fair Nut can take 3 liters from the first keg, 2 liters from the second keg, and 3 liters from the third keg, resulting in 2 liters of kvass in the least keg.
