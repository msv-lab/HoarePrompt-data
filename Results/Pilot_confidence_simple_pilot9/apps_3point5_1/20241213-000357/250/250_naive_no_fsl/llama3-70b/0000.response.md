Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw that causes it to fail in certain scenarios. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` require different additional marks to be added, but the algorithm only considers adding one of them at a time. This can lead to missing the optimal solution.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

The program should output:
```
1
230
```

However, the current implementation might not add the necessary mark if it only checks for one condition at a time. A more robust approach would involve checking for both conditions simultaneously and ensuring all necessary marks are added.

Here is a revised version of the function that addresses this issue:

```python
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if x and y can be measured directly
    if x in marks and y in marks:
        additional_marks = []
    elif x in marks:
        additional_marks = [y]
    elif y in marks:
        additional_marks = [x]
    else:
        # Check if either x or y can be formed by adding a mark
        for i in marks:
            if i + x <= l and i + x not in marks:
                additional_marks = [i + x]
                break
            if i + y <= l and i + y not in marks:
                additional_marks = [i + y]
                break
        else:
            # Both x and y need their own marks
            additional_marks = [x, y]
    
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))

func()
```

This revised version ensures that both `x` and `y` are checked simultaneously and that all necessary marks are added, thereby addressing the logical flaw in the original program.
