Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints it, which is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the triangle must remain a valid non-degenerate triangle during the transformations. 

For example, consider the input `(10, 5)`. According to the problem, the correct sequence of transformations would be:

1. Start with a triangle of side length 10.
2. Change one side to 5, resulting in a triangle of sides (5, 10, 10).
3. Change another side to 5, resulting in a triangle of sides (5, 5, 10).
4. Change the last side to 5, resulting in a triangle of sides (5, 5, 5).

This requires 3 steps, but the program would output `5`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases.
