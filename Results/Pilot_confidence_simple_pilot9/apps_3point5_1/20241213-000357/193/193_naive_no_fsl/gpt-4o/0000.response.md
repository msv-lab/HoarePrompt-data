Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the program calculates `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which does not account for the fact that the changes must maintain the triangle inequality theorem (the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side).

For example, consider the input `22 4`. The program outputs `6`, but the correct solution should be `6` as shown in the problem note. However, the program's logic does not ensure that the intermediate steps maintain the triangle inequality. 

A correct approach would involve reducing the side length step-by-step while ensuring the triangle inequality is maintained. The provided solution does not handle this correctly, hence it is incorrect.
