Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program uses a brute-force approach by iterating over possible values of \(x\) (the number of Ber-Cola bottles) from 0 to \(n // a\), and for each value of \(x\), it calculates the corresponding \(y\) (the number of Bars bars) as \((n - x \cdot a) // b\). This approach may miss solutions where \(y\) is not an integer, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
15
4
8
```

The correct answer should be `NO` because there are no non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(4x + 8y = 15\). However, the program will incorrectly output `YES` with \(x = 0\) and \(y = 1.875\), which is not valid since \(y\) must be an integer.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that both \(x\) and \(y\) are non-negative integers. A more appropriate approach would be to use a more systematic method, such as checking all pairs \((x, y)\) within the valid range and ensuring both \(x\) and \(y\) are integers.
