Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Kefa can distribute all the balloons such that no friend gets two balloons of the same color. The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each balloon color and checks if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends. This ensures that if the maximum number of any single color is within the number of friends, it is possible to distribute the balloons without any friend getting two of the same color. Since the program handles all described cases and examples correctly, it is considered correct.
