Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a directed graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Graph Representation**: The program constructs a directed graph using adjacency lists and correctly handles the input format.
2. **Cycle Detection**: The `has_cycle` function uses a topological sort approach via in-degree to detect cycles. It ensures that if the graph is acyclic, it will return `True`.
3. **Edge Removal Check**: The program iterates over each edge and temporarily removes it to check if the graph becomes acyclic. If any removal results in a cycle-free graph, it returns `YES`. If no such edge is found after checking all edges, it returns `NO`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
