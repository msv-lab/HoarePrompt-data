Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to maximize the expected number of caught fishes, not just place a certain number of fishes in the pond. The current implementation simply calculates the minimum of `k` and the total number of possible scoop positions and divides it by the total number of possible scoop positions. This does not maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to strategically place the fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes when the scoop is thrown randomly. A correct approach would involve calculating the optimal positions for the fishes based on the geometry of the scoop-net and the dimensions of the pond. The given solution does not address this requirement.
