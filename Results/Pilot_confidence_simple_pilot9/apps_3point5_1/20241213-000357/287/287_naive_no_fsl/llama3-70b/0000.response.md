Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is based on finding divisors of \( n \), which does not align with the requirement to find the number of different weights of splits of \( n \).

To solve this problem correctly, we need to recognize that for any \( n \), the possible weights of splits are all integers from 1 to \( n \). This is because for any integer \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \)), we can construct a split where the first element is \( k \) and the rest are \( 1 \)'s. For example, for \( n = 7 \), we can have weights 1, 2, 3, 7.

The program fails to cover this logic. It only checks for divisors of \( n \) and does not account for all possible weights from 1 to \( n \). Therefore, the output will be incorrect for many values of \( n \).
