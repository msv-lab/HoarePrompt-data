Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the array contains only zeros. For example, consider the input:

```
1
0
```

According to the problem description, this should output "NO" because the sum of elements in the array is zero, and it's not possible to split the array such that each subarray has a non-zero sum. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect output of "YES" with an invalid split. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
