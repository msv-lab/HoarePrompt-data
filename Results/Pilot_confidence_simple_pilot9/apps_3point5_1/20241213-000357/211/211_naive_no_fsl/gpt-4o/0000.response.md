Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has issues with handling certain cases. Specifically, it fails to handle arrays where the sum of elements is zero but can still be split into non-zero sum subarrays. For example:

Consider the input:
```
4
1 -1 1 -1
```

According to the problem description, the array can be split into subarrays with non-zero sums:
- [1, -1] and [1, -1]

However, the provided program will output "NO" because the sum of the entire array is zero (`1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = 0`), and it does not account for splitting the array into non-contiguous segments.

To fix this, the program needs to check for segments within the array that have non-zero sums and split the array accordingly. Hereâ€™s an updated version of the program that addresses this issue:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if the whole array has a non-zero sum
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum == 0:
        # Find subarrays with non-zero sums
        subarrays = []
        start = 0
        for end in range(n):
            if sum(A[start:end+1]) != 0:
                subarrays.append((start + 1, end + 1))
            elif subarrays:
                subarrays[-1] = (subarrays[-1][0], end)
                start = end + 1
        if subarrays:
            print('YES')
            print(len(subarrays))
            for l, r in subarrays:
                print(l, r)
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1, n)

func()
```

This version of the program correctly handles cases where the array can be split into subarrays with non-zero sums, even if the total sum of the array is zero.
