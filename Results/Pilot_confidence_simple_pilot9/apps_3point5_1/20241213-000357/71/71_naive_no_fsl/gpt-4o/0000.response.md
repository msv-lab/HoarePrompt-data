Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the input number `n` ends with less than `k` zeros but has a non-zero digit before those zeros. This leads to an incorrect output.

For example, consider the input:
```
10020 3
```

- The expected output should be `2`, as we need to remove both `1` and `2` to make the number `000` (or `0`), which is divisible by \(10^3 = 1000\).
- However, the program will count the zeros from the end, stopping at the first non-zero digit (`2`), and will incorrectly return `1` instead of `2`.

To fix this, the program should continue counting zeros even if non-zero digits are encountered until `k` zeros are found or all digits are processed.
