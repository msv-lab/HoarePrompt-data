Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle a scenario where the round is rated, but no participant's rating changes, and the participants' ratings are in non-increasing order. This situation matches the condition that it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6
3060 3060
2194 2194
2876 2876
2624 2624
3007 3007
2884 2884
```

In this case, no one's rating changes (`is_rated` remains `False`), and the participants' ratings are in non-increasing order (`is_unrated` remains `False`). However, since the problem states that if the round is rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one participant's rating would have changed, the correct output should be "maybe" instead of "unrated".
