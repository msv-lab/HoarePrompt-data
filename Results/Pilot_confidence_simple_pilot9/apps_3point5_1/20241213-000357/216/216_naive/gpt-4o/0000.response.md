Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions according to the problem description. It iterates through the string, adding lowercase letters to a set until it encounters an uppercase letter, at which point it checks the size of the current set and resets it. This ensures that the set only contains distinct lowercase letters without any uppercase letters in between. The final check ensures that the maximum size of the set is printed. Given the examples and the problem constraints, the program handles all potential cases as expected.
