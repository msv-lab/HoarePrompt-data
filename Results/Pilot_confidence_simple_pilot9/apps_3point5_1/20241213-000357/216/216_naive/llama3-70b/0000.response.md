Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not consider the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between the chosen positions. This is evident from the example inputs:

- For the input `aaaaBaabAbA`, the output should be `2` because the positions `6` and `8` (both containing 'a') form a valid pretty set, but the program returns the length of all lowercase letters, which is `4`.
- For the input `zACaAbbaazzC`, the output should be `3` because the positions `7`, `8`, and `11` (all containing 'a' or 'z') form a valid pretty set, but the program returns the length of all lowercase letters, which is `6`.

The program only counts the number of lowercase letters in the string without checking the constraints related to the positions of these letters. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
