Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use based on the given ratio (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears). The logic in the program is sound:

1. It takes the minimum value between the number of lemons (`a`), half the number of apples (`b // 2`), and a quarter of the number of pears (`c // 4`) to determine how many complete sets of the required ratio can be formed.
2. It then multiplies this minimum value by the respective quantities needed (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears) to get the total number of fruits used.
3. Finally, it prints the result.

Given the constraints and examples provided, the program handles all potential cases correctly. For instance, if Nikolay has 2 lemons, 5 apples, and 7 pears, the program will correctly output 7, as he can use 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. Similarly, for 4 lemons, 7 apples, and 13 pears, the output is 21, using 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears. If the numbers do not meet the required ratio, such as in the case of 2 lemons, 3 apples, and 2 pears, the program correctly outputs 0.

Since the program works for all tested cases and follows the problem description accurately, it is correct.
