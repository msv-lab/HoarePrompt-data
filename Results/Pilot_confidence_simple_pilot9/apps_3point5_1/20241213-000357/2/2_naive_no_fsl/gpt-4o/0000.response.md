Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the input number consists entirely of the digit '1'. In such cases, the logic to replace the first digit with '0' and fill the rest with '9's will result in an incorrect output. For example, if the input is `111`, the program will produce `999`, but the correct output should be `111` itself since it already has the maximum sum of digits (3) and is the largest number with this property.
