Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal and compares them. The function `func_1` correctly performs the base conversion by iterating through each digit and calculating its decimal value. The main program reads the inputs, converts both numbers to decimal, and compares them, outputting the correct comparison symbol ('<', '>', '=') as specified in the problem description. Since the program handles all described cases and examples without issues, it is correct.
