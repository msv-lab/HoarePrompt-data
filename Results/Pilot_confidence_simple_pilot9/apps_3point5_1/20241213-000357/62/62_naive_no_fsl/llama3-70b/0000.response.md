Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases. It converts each number from its respective base to a decimal integer using the `func_1` function, and then compares these decimal values. Given the constraints and examples provided, the program handles all potential cases correctly:

1. The program correctly reads the input for both numbers and their bases.
2. The `func_1` function accurately converts the number from the given base to a decimal integer.
3. The comparison logic (`if x < y`, `elif x > y`, `else: print('=')`) ensures that the correct output character ('<', '>', '=') is printed based on the comparison result.

Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and examples provided, it is correct.
