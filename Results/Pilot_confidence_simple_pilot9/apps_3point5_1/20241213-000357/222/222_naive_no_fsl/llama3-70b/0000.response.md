Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. Specifically, the logic used to determine `l` (the number of actions) and the list `res` (the skewers to be turned) is flawed.

For instance, consider the following input:
- Input: `7 2`

According to the problem description, to turn over all 7 skewers, Miroslav needs at least 2 actions. However, the program incorrectly outputs:
```
2
1 6 
```

Hereâ€™s why the program fails:
- The formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` for calculating the number of actions is incorrect. This formula assumes a uniform distribution of actions which may not always be optimal.
- The list `res` is generated by simply taking every `(k * 2 + 1)`-th skewer starting from 1, which does not guarantee the minimum number of actions.

A correct approach would involve a more complex algorithm to ensure that the minimum number of actions is achieved, considering overlapping effects of each action. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and thus is incorrect.
