Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the smallest possible frame cannot be formed because the white pixels are not contiguous or form a rectangle. Specifically, the program assumes that the smallest frame will always be a rectangle and does not consider the possibility that the smallest valid frame might be a smaller non-rectangular shape.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5
w.w..
..w..
w.w..
```

In this case, the smallest valid frame should be of size 1x3, but the program will incorrectly return -1 because it only checks for rectangular frames. A correct solution would need to consider all possible minimal frames and choose the smallest one.
