Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. Let's verify this by considering a few test cases:

1. **Input: 4 7**
   - Year 1: Limak's weight = 4 * 3 = 12, Bob's weight = 7 * 2 = 14. Limak is still smaller.
   - Year 2: Limak's weight = 12 * 3 = 36, Bob's weight = 14 * 2 = 28. Limak is now larger.
   - Output: 2

2. **Input: 4 9**
   - Year 1: Limak's weight = 4 * 3 = 12, Bob's weight = 9 * 2 = 18. Limak is still smaller.
   - Year 2: Limak's weight = 12 * 3 = 36, Bob's weight = 18 * 2 = 36. Limak is now larger.
   - Year 3: Limak's weight = 36 * 3 = 108, Bob's weight = 36 * 2 = 72. Limak is larger.
   - Output: 3

3. **Input: 1 1**
   - Year 1: Limak's weight = 1 * 3 = 3, Bob's weight = 1 * 2 = 2. Limak is now larger.
   - Output: 1

In each of these cases, the program correctly calculates the number of years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
