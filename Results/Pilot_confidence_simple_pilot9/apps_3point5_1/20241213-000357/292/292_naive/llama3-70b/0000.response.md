Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob. The program initializes `years` to 0 and then enters a loop where it triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight each year until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The loop increments the `years` counter each time the weights are updated. This approach ensures that the program works correctly for all valid inputs within the given constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10).

Since the program handles all the given examples correctly and the logic seems sound for the described problem, it is considered correct.
