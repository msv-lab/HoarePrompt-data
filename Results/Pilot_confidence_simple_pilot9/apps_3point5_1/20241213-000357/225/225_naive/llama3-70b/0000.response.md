Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to jump from the start to the end of the string, landing only on vowels. The logic iterates through the string, tracking the last vowel encountered and calculating the maximum jump needed between vowels. This ensures that the Grasshopper can cover the entire string by only landing on vowels, as required by the problem description. Since the program handles all potential cases correctly based on the examples and the problem constraints, it meets the requirements.
