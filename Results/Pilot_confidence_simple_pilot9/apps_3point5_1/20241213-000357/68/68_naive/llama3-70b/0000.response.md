Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description. Let's break down the analysis:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - If \(x > y + z\), the program prints `+`, which is correct because Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes regardless of the votes from the \(z\) unknown persons.
   - If \(x < y\), the program prints `-`, which is correct because Nauuo would get more downvotes than upvotes regardless of the votes from the \(z\) unknown persons.
   - If \(x == y\), the program checks if \(z == 0\):
     - If \(z == 0\), it prints `0`, which is correct because the number of upvotes equals the number of downvotes.
     - If \(z != 0\), it prints `?`, which is correct because the outcome depends on the votes of the \(z\) unknown persons.
   - If \(x \geq y\) and \(x \leq y + z\), the program prints `?`, which is correct because the outcome is uncertain due to the \(z\) unknown persons' votes.

Since the program covers all these cases and handles them correctly, it is considered correct.
