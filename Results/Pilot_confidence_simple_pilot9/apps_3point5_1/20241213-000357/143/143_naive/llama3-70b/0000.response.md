Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to minimize the cost of buying at least `L` liters of lemonade. It iterates through each possible volume of lemonade that can be bought and updates the minimum cost to achieve each volume up to `L`. The program handles all potential cases by considering all possible bottle types and their respective volumes and costs. The logic ensures that the minimum cost to achieve the required volume is calculated accurately. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
