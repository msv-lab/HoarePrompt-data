Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the entire string. The logic in the program only increments the `operations` counter whenever it encounters a different character compared to the previous one. This approach does not account for contiguous substrings of the same character that need to be deleted.

For example, consider the input:
```
Input
4
aaaa
```
The program will output:
```
Output
3
```
However, the correct answer should be 1, as we can delete the entire substring "aaaa" in one operation.

Therefore, the program does not handle the requirement to delete contiguous substrings of the same character efficiently and accurately.
