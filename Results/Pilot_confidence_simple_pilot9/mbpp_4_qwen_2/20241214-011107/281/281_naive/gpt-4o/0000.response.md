Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns even numbers from a list. The list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` ensures that only even numbers are included in the result. Given the problem description to find even numbers from a list of numbers, the function meets this requirement for all tested cases and no edge cases have been identified where it fails. Therefore, the program is correct.
