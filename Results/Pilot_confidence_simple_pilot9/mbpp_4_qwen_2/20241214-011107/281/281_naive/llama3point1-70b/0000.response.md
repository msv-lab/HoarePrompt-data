Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers using a list comprehension. It checks each number in the list to see if it is divisible by 2 (`num % 2 == 0`) and includes it in the result if true. This logic is consistent with the problem description of finding even numbers. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where this function would fail based on the given problem statement and common test cases.
