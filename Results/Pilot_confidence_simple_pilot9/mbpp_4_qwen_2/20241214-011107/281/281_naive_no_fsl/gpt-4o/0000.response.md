Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from a list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list and includes only those numbers that are divisible by 2 (i.e., even numbers). Based on the provided test cases:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `[2, 4]`.
2. `func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1])` returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`.
3. `func_1([8, 12, 15, 19])` returns `[8, 12]`.

All these cases demonstrate that the function works as expected for finding even numbers. Additionally, the function does not have any issues with edge cases such as empty lists, lists with no even numbers, or lists containing negative numbers (since negative even numbers are still even).

Since the function handles the provided cases correctly and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
