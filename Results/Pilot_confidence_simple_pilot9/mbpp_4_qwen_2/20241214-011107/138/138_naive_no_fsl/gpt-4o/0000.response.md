Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`. The provided test cases cover typical scenarios and edge cases, and the function handles them correctly. There doesn't appear to be any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling based on the provided information.
