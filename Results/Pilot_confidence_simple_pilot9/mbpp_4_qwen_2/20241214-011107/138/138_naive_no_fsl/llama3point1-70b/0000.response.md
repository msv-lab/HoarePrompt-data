Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior. It uses the `index` method of the list to find the first occurrence of the specified element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns `(False, -1)`. This covers all potential cases as per the problem description, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for any input array and element.
