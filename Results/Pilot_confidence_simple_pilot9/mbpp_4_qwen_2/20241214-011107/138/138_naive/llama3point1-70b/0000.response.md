Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the `index` method to find the first occurrence of the specified element in the array, which returns the index if the element is present or raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found. The program handles both cases by catching the `ValueError` and returning `(False, -1)` in such scenarios. This ensures that the program works correctly for all potential inputs, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
