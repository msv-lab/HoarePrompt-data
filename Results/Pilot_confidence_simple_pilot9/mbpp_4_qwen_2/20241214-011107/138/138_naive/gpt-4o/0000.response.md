Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value at each iteration. It checks if the current value matches the target element and returns a tuple `(True, index)` if a match is found. If no match is found after completing the loop, it returns `(False, -1)`. This approach correctly handles all elements in the array, including edge cases like empty arrays or arrays without the target element. Since the program works as expected for the given test cases and there are no apparent logical flaws or missed edge cases, it meets the problem description in all potential cases.
