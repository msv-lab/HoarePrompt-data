Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the list with the maximum length in a list of lists. It iterates through each list, updates the maximum length and the corresponding list whenever it finds a longer list. The function returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the list itself. All the provided test cases (`assert` statements) are handled correctly by the function, and it appears to work for the given problem description without any missing logic or edge cases.
