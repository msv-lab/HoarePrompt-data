Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist of maximum length. However, the problem description asks for the list of all sublists of maximum length, not just the first one. For example, consider the following input:

Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [1, 2]]`

The maximum length of sublists is 2. The expected output is `[ [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6] ]`, but the function will only return `[1, 2]`.

To fix this, the function should return all sublists of maximum length instead of just the first one. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_sublists
```

This version correctly returns all sublists of the maximum length.
