Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the maximum length in a list of lists. It iterates through each list, keeps track of the maximum length found so far, and updates the list accordingly. The function returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the corresponding list. All the provided test cases correctly demonstrate this behavior. Since no edge cases or potential errors were identified, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.
