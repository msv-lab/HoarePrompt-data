Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program returns the first sublist of maximum length, but the problem description asks for a list containing the maximum length and the sublist(s) of that length. The program should return a tuple `(max_len, max_sublists)` where `max_sublists` is a list of all sublists of maximum length, not just the first one. For example, consider the following input:

```
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10]]
```

The output of the program will be:

```
(3, [3, 4, 5])
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
(3, [[3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])
```

This shows that the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
