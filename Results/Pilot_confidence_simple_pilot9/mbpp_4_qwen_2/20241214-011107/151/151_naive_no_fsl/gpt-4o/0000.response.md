Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens the nested list structures as demonstrated by the assertions. It recursively processes each element, ensuring that lists within the nested structure are fully expanded into a single flat list. Given the nature of the provided test cases and the recursive approach, there do not appear to be any edge cases that would cause this function to fail according to the problem description.
