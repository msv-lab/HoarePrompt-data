Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` recursively flattens a nested list structure. It checks each element of the input list. If the element is a list, it recursively calls itself to flatten that sublist and extends the current flat list with the result. If the element is not a list, it appends the element to the flat list. This approach handles all potential cases, including nested lists of arbitrary depth. Since there is no scenario found where this function fails to flatten the nested list correctly, the program is considered correct.
