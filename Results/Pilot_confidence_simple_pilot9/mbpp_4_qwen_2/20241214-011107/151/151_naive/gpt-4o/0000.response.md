Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. It recursively processes each element, appending non-list elements directly to the flat list and extending the flat list with the result of calling `func_1` on list elements. This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their nesting level, are included in the final flat list. Given the provided test cases and the nature of the solution, it appears the function works as intended for the described problem.
