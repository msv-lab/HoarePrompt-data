Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The program uses the `math` module to access the value of \( \pi \) and performs the calculation accurately. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the given problem description.
