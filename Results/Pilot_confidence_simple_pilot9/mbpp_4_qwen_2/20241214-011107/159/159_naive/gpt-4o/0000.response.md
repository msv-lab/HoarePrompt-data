Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function `func_1` correctly implements this formula. The assertions given in the problem description also confirm that the function works correctly for the provided test cases (5, 12), (10, 15), and (19, 17). Since the function uses the mathematical constant \(\pi\) from the `math` module and applies the formula accurately, it is reasonable to conclude that the function will work correctly for any valid inputs, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
