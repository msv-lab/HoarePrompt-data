Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function appears to be correctly implemented based on the provided test cases. The `math.isclose` function with a relative tolerance of 0.001 is used to verify the results, which indicates that the function is producing values that are very close to the expected results. Since the function seems to handle the provided test cases correctly and the formula is mathematically sound, we can conclude that the program is correct for the given problem description.
