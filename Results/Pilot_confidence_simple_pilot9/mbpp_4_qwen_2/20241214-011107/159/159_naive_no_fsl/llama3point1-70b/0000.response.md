Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume. There are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that this function fails to handle. Since the mathematical formula is correctly applied and the function seems to work for all valid inputs, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
