Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such case, it returns `True`. This logic ensures that the function meets the requirement specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
