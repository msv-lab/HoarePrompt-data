Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The expression `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing us to iterate over columns instead of rows. Then, the list comprehension calculates the sum of each column and divides it by the number of tuples to get the average. This approach works for any list of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length. Since the function handles the computation correctly for all tested cases and there are no edge cases mentioned that would break this logic, the function is correct.
