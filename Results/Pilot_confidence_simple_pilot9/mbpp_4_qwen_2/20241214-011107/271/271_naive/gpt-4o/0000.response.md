Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position. The program iterates through each position of the tuples, collects the values at that position from all tuples, computes their average, and appends it to the `averages` list. This process is applied consistently across all provided test cases and would work for any valid input tuple of tuples. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
