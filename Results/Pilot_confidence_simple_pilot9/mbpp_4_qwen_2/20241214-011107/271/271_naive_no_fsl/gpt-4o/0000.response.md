Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided `func_1` function correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the values at that position from all tuples, calculates their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for any input where the tuples have the same length. All the provided test cases demonstrate the function's correctness, and no specific edge cases were found where the function fails to meet the requirements.
