Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over each position across all tuples simultaneously. It then computes the sum of the values at each position and divides by the number of tuples to get the average. This approach works for any input where the tuples are of the same length, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description. Since the function handles the calculation correctly for all elements in the tuples, it meets the requirements for every potential case.
