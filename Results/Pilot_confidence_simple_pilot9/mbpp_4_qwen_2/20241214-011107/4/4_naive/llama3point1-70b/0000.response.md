Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by using the XOR operation and counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. If the count is exactly 1, it means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This logic correctly implements the described functionality for all possible cases. There are no edge cases or inputs where this function would fail based on the problem description.
