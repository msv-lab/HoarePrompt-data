Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a given number is undulating or not according to the problem description. An undulating number is defined as a number where the digits alternate between two different values, and the function checks this condition effectively. The function handles edge cases like numbers with less than three digits and ensures that the first two digits are different, which is a requirement for an undulating number. Based on the provided test cases, the function works correctly, and no other edge cases were found that would make the function incorrect.
