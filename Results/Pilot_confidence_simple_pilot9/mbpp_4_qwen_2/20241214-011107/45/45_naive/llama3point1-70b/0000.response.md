Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify undulating numbers. An undulating number is defined as a number that has the form ABABAB... (i.e., alternating between two digits). The current implementation checks only a single step between three consecutive digits and does not ensure that this pattern holds throughout the entire number. 

For example, consider the number `1212`. According to the definition, this should be an undulating number because it alternates between `1` and `2`. However, the current program will incorrectly return `False` for this number because it only checks the first few steps and might miss the overall pattern. A more comprehensive check is needed to ensure the alternating pattern holds throughout the entire length of the number.
