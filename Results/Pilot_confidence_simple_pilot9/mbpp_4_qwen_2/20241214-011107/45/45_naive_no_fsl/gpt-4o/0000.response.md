Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a given number is undulating. An undulating number is defined as a number that has an alternating pattern of two digits (e.g., 121212, 353535). The function correctly implements this logic:

1. It first checks if the length of the number is less than 3, in which case it returns `False`.
2. It then compares the first two digits. If they are the same, it returns `False`.
3. For the rest of the digits, it alternates between checking against the first digit and the second digit.

Given the assertions provided:
- `func_1(1212121)` returns `True`, which is correct because 1212121 has an alternating pattern.
- `func_1(1991)` returns `False`, which is correct because 1991 does not have an alternating pattern.
- `func_1(121)` returns `True`, which is correct because 121 has an alternating pattern.

After reviewing the logic and the provided test cases, the function appears to handle all cases correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the given problem description.
