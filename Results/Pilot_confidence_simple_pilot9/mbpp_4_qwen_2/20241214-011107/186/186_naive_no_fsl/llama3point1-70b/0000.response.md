Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to perform a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples using a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor. However, this approach will raise a `TypeError` when applied to non-integer values. For example, if either `tup1` or `tup2` contains non-integer values, the program will fail.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 'a')
tup2 = (3, 4, 5)
```
In this case, the program will attempt to perform a bitwise AND operation between `2 & 'a'`, which is not valid and will raise a `TypeError`.

A correct implementation would involve checking that both tuples contain only integers before performing the bitwise AND operation, or using a different method that can handle non-integer types appropriately.
