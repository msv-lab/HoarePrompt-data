Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two input tuples. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to apply the `&` operator element-wise. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function passes all of them. Given the nature of the operation and the provided examples, there doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential scenario that this function would handle incorrectly. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.
