Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program attempts to perform an element-wise operation using the bitwise AND (`&`) operator on elements from two tuples. However, the problem description asks to extract elements from the given two tuples, which implies returning the tuples themselves rather than performing a bitwise operation. 

For example, if `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5, 6)`, the expected output would be `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`, but the program returns a new tuple with the result of the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements, which is `(0, 0, 0)`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and should return `False`.
