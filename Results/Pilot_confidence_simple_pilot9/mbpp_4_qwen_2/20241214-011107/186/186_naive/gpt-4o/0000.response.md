Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses the bitwise AND operation (`&`) between corresponding elements of the two tuples and returns a new tuple with the results. However, the problem description asks to extract elements and tuples, which implies returning individual elements and possibly the tuples themselves, rather than performing a bitwise AND operation.

For example, consider the input `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4))`. The expected output would be two separate values, such as `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`, but the program performs a bitwise AND operation, resulting in `(1 & 3, 2 & 4) = (1, 0)`. This does not meet the requirement to extract elements and tuples as described in the problem statement.
