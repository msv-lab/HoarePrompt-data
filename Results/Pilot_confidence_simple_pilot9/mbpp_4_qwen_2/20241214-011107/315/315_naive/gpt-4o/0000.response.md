Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the converted tuple to a list. The assertions given in the example demonstrate that the function works correctly for the provided test cases. Since the function concatenates the list and the tuple without modifying the original list or tuple, and handles the addition of elements from the tuple to the list, it satisfies the requirements for adding a tuple to a list. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description and the provided examples.
