Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all elements in the list are the same, which is a valid scenario for the problem description. For instance, if the input list is `[2, 2, 2]`, the function should return `None` because there is no second smallest number. However, the current implementation returns `-1`, which is incorrect. This is evident from the test case `assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None` failing. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
