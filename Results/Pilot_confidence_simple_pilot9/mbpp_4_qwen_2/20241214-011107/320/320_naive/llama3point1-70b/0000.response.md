Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the list contains duplicate values that are the smallest in the list. For example, consider the list `[4, 4, 5, 6]`. The second smallest number in this list is `5`, but the program will return `4` because it first removes duplicates with `set` and then sorts the unique numbers. This does not correctly identify the second smallest number in cases where the smallest number appears more than once.
