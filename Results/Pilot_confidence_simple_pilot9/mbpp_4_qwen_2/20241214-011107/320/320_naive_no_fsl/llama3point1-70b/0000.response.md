Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using `set`, then sorting the resulting list, and finally returning the second element. This approach works for all potential cases as long as the list contains at least two unique numbers. If the list has fewer than two unique numbers, it returns `None` as expected. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
