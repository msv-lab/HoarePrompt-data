Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in the list. Here's why:

1. **Positive Numbers and Negative Numbers**: The function handles both positive and negative numbers correctly. For example, in the first test case `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the second smallest number is `-2`, which the function correctly returns.
2. **Duplicate Numbers**: It also handles lists with duplicate numbers properly. In the second test case `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the second smallest number is `-0.5`, and the function correctly returns this value.
3. **Duplicate Minimum Values**: When all elements are the same (as in the third test case `[2, 2]`), the function correctly returns `None`.
4. **Single Element List**: When the list has fewer than two unique elements (as in the fourth test case `[2, 2, 2]`), the function also correctly returns `None`.

Given these scenarios, the function appears to handle all relevant cases correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
