Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the string. Here's why:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the first occurrence and `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence of the character. These methods return the index of the first and last occurrence, respectively, or `-1` if the character is not found.
2. **Edge Cases Handling**: 
   - If the character is not found in the string (both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are `-1`), the function returns the original string `s`.
   - If the first and last occurrences are the same, the function correctly removes only the first occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
   - If the first and last occurrences are different, the function correctly slices the string to exclude both occurrences.
3. **General Case**: For any valid input, the function behaves as expected. It handles strings with multiple occurrences of the character, strings with only one occurrence of the character, and strings without the character at all.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases described in the problem, the program is correct.
