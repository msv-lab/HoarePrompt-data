Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string in all tested cases. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Finding Indices**: The function uses `s.find(ch)` to get the index of the first occurrence of `ch` and `s.rfind(ch)` to get the index of the last occurrence of `ch`.

2. **Edge Cases**: If the character `ch` is not found in the string (`first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1`), the function returns the original string `s`. If the first and last occurrences of `ch` are at the same position (`first_index == last_index`), the function also returns the original string `s`.

3. **String Manipulation**: The function constructs a new string by concatenating parts of the original string excluding the first and last occurrences of `ch`.

Given the provided test cases and the logic implemented, the function handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
