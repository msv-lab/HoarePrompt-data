Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. Here's a breakdown:

- The `find` method locates the first occurrence of the character.
- The `rfind` method locates the last occurrence of the character.
- If both occurrences are found and they are different positions, the character is removed from both positions.
- If they are the same position, the character is only removed once using `replace`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:
- If the character is not found in the string, the original string is returned unchanged.
- If the character is found but is the only character in the string, the entire string is removed.
- If the character is found multiple times but not at both ends, only the first and last occurrences are removed.

There are no apparent edge cases that this program fails to handle. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
