Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same. It works as expected in the given test cases:
- `func_1('python') == False` because not all characters are the same.
- `func_1('aaa') == True` because all characters are the same.
- `func_1('data') == False` because not all characters are the same.

The function correctly returns `True` if the string is empty (`if not s: return True`) and iterates through the string to ensure all characters match the first character. Since no counterexample has been found, the program appears to meet the problem description for all potential cases.
