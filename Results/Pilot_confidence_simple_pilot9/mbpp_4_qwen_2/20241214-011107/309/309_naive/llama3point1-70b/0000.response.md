Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This approach is correct because a set contains only unique elements, so if all characters are the same, the set will contain only one element. This logic works for all potential cases, including empty strings and strings with repeated characters. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
