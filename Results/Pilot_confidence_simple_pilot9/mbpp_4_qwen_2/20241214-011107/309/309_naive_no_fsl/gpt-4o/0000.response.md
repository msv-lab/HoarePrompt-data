Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all characters in a string are the same. The logic in the function is correct:

1. It returns `True` if the string is empty, which is a valid base case.
2. It sets the `first_char` to the first character of the string.
3. It iterates through each character in the string and checks if it matches the `first_char`.
4. If any character does not match, it immediately returns `False`.
5. If all characters match, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- `func_1('python') == False`: All characters are different.
- `func_1('aaa') == True`: All characters are the same.
- `func_1('data') == False`: Not all characters are the same.

Since the function works correctly for these test cases and the logic is sound, the program is correct for the given problem description.
