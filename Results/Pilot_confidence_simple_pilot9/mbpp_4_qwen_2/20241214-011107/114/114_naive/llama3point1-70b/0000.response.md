Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. This method works for all possible inputs, including empty tuples, tuples with repeated elements, and tuples with the specified element present multiple times or not at all. Since the function behaves as expected in all cases, it is correct according to the problem description.
