Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. This method iterates through the tuple and counts the number of times the specified element appears, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. All the provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected. Since the function handles all tested cases correctly and the logic appears to be sound, we can conclude that the program is correct.
