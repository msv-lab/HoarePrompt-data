Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of an element. However, the problem description does not specify that the input tuple will only contain hashable types (like integers, strings, etc.). The provided test cases only include integers, but if the tuple contains unhashable types like lists or dictionaries, the `count` method will raise a `TypeError`. For example:

```python
assert func_1(([1], [2]), [1]) == 0  # This will raise a TypeError
```

Since the program does not handle unhashable types, it fails for certain inputs, making it incorrect according to the given problem description.
