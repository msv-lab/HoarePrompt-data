Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of an element within the tuple. This method will return the number of times the specified element appears in the tuple, which exactly meets the requirement of the problem description. Since there are no edge cases or special conditions mentioned in the problem that the function does not handle, and the provided solution accurately fulfills the requirement for any valid input, the function is correct.
