Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles the case where the tuple is empty by returning `True`, and iterates through the tuple to ensure all elements match the data type of the first element. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including an empty tuple, a tuple with mixed types, and a tuple with elements of the same type. Since the function behaves as expected in these cases and the logic appears sound, the program is correct.
