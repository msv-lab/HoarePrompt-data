Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a set to collect the unique types of elements in the tuple. Since a set only keeps unique elements, if all elements in the tuple have the same data type, the length of the set will be 1. This logic correctly checks whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. Given this, the function works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
