Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type by converting each element's type to a set and checking if the size of the set is 1. This approach works correctly for all potential cases. It handles empty tuples, tuples with a single element, and tuples with multiple elements of the same or different types. Since the function consistently returns the correct result for all these cases, it meets the problem description accurately.
