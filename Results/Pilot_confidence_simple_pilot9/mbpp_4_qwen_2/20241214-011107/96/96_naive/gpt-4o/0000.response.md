Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It initializes `first_type` as the type of the first element in the tuple and then iterates through the rest of the elements to ensure they all match this type. The function handles empty tuples correctly by returning `True`. Based on the provided test cases and reasoning, the function works as expected for all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
