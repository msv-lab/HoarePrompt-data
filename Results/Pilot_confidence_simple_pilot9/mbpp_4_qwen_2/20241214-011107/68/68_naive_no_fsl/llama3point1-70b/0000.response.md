Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function from the `cmath` module. Given the problem description to write a function to get the angle of a complex number, this implementation satisfies the requirement for any valid real and imaginary inputs. Since the `cmath.phase` function handles all valid complex numbers appropriately, the provided function will work correctly for all such inputs. Therefore, there is no potential case where the program does not meet the requirements as described.
