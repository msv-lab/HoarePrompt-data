Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses `cmath.phase()` to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number. The function appears to handle the given test cases correctly:

1. For the input `(0, 1j)`, the phase is approximately `1.5708`, which is the expected value for a purely imaginary number with a positive imaginary part.
2. For the input `(2, 1j)`, the phase is approximately `0.4636`, which is the expected value for a complex number with both real and imaginary parts.
3. For the input `(0, 2j)`, the phase is again approximately `1.5708`, which is the expected value for a purely imaginary number with a positive imaginary part.

Given these inputs and the nature of the `cmath.phase()` function, which correctly calculates the phase of a complex number, there are no apparent issues with the implementation. Therefore, the program is correct according to the provided problem description.
