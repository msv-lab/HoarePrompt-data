Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function from the `cmath` module. Given any real and imaginary parts of a complex number, the function returns the angle in radians, which is consistent with the mathematical definition and the problem description. There doesn't appear to be any edge case or potential scenario where this function would fail based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
