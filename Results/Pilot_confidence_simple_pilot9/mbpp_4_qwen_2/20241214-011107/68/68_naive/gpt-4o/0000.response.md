Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `cmath.phase` method to calculate the angle of a complex number, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. The function takes the real and imaginary parts as separate arguments, constructs a complex number from them, and returns the phase of that complex number. The provided test cases also match the expected behavior, confirming that the function works correctly for the given examples. Since the function adheres to the problem description and passes the provided test cases, it is correct.
