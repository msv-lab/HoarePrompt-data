Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (the last character) of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates over each string in the tuple and returns a list of the last characters. This solution handles all potential cases where the input is a tuple of strings. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
