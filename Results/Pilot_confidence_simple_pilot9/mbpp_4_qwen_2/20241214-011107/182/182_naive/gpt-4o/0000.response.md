Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) from each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string in the tuple and appends its last character to the resulting list. All the provided test cases confirm this behavior. Since the function works correctly for the given examples and there are no apparent edge cases or logical errors, the program is correct.
