Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This directly matches the problem description. Since the function uses list comprehension with `s[-1]`, it correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description. Therefore, the function is correct for all potential cases.
