Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1(nums)` checks if the given list `nums` is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. If the original list and the sorted list are the same, it returns `True`, indicating the list is sorted. This approach works for all potential cases because a list is considered sorted if and only if it is identical to its sorted version. There are no edge cases or scenarios where this logic would fail based on the provided problem description.
