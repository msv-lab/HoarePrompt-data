Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, it immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after completing the iteration. 

The function seems to handle the cases provided in the assertions correctly:
- It returns `True` for the first list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`, which is sorted.
- It returns `False` for the second list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`, where the number `20` is out of order.
- It returns `False` for the third list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`, where the number `15` is followed by `14`.

Given that the function appears to handle the provided test cases correctly and follows the logic to verify if a list is sorted, it is likely to be correct for other similar cases as well. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
