Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in ascending order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, it immediately returns `False`. If no such pair is found, it returns `True`, indicating the list is sorted.

Given the assertions:
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True` (The list is sorted)
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False` (The list is not sorted due to the element 20 coming before 17)
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False` (The list is not sorted due to the element 15 coming before 14)

The function handles these cases correctly. Additionally, since the function checks every pair of adjacent elements, it will work for any potential sorted list or unsorted list, ensuring it meets the problem description for every case.
