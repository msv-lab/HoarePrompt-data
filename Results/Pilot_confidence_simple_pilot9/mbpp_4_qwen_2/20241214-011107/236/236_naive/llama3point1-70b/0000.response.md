Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program `func_1` checks if the given list `nums` is equal to its sorted version. This approach is correct for lists that are already sorted in ascending order. However, it fails to handle lists that are sorted in descending order or any other custom sorting order. For example, if the list is `[3, 2, 1]`, which is sorted in descending order, the function will incorrectly return `False`.

A correct solution should check if the list is sorted in either ascending or descending order. Here is an improved version of the function:

```python
def is_sorted(nums):
    if not nums:
        return True
    increasing = decreasing = True
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:
            decreasing = False
        elif nums[i] < nums[i-1]:
            increasing = False
    return increasing or decreasing
```

This function checks both ascending and descending orders, ensuring correctness for all potential cases.
