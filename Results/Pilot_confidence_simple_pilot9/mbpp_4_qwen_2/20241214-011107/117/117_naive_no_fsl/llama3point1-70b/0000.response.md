Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the number of integer elements in the given list. The `isinstance(x, int)` check ensures that only integer elements contribute to the sum, which effectively counts the number of integer elements. This approach works for all potential cases where the input is a list containing any type of elements, including integers, floats, strings, etc. Since the function accurately counts the number of integer elements regardless of other types present in the list, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
