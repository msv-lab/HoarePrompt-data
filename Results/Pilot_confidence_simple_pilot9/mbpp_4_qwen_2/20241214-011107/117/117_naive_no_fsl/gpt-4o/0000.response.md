Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the integers. Given the examples:

1. `assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2` - This is correct because there are 2 integer elements (1, 2).
2. `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3` - This is correct because there are 3 integer elements (1, 2, 3).
3. `assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2` - This is correct because there are 2 integer elements (1, 4).

The function handles all these cases correctly. Additionally, the function will correctly identify integers in any list, including edge cases such as an empty list, lists with no integers, and lists with mixed types where only integers are present. Therefore, the function meets the problem description for all potential cases.
