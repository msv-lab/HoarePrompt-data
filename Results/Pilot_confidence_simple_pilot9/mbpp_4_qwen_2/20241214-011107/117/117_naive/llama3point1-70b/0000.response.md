Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list by using a generator expression with `isinstance(x, int)` inside the `sum()` function. This approach iterates over each element in the list, checks if it is an instance of `int`, and sums up the `True` values (which are treated as 1) and `False` values (which are treated as 0). Since the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for any given list, it meets the requirements in all potential cases.
