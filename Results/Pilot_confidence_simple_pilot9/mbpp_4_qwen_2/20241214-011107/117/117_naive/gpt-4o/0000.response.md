Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over the list and count how many elements are instances of the `int` type. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

1. A list containing integers and a string (`[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]`) which correctly returns `2`.
2. A list containing only integers (`[1, 2, 3]`) which correctly returns `3`.
3. A list containing integers and floats (`[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]`) which correctly returns `2`.

Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the logic is sound, it can be concluded that the function is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description.
