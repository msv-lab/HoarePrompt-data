Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\), which is correct according to the problem description. The function takes three parameters: `b` (the base of the triangle), `h` (the height of the triangle), and `l` (the length of the prism). Since the formula is mathematically sound and the function directly implements it without any conditional checks or additional logic, it will work correctly for all valid inputs where `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive numbers. There are no edge cases or potential scenarios identified where this function would fail to meet the problem description.
