Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The given test cases cover different scenarios and all pass the expected results. Since the function handles the base, height, and length appropriately and the examples provided are consistent with the formula, there is no indication that the program would fail for any other potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
