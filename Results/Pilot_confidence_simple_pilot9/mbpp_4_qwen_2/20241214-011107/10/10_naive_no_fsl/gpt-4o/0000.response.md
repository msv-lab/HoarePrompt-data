Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The assertions given in the test cases also correctly validate the function's output for different inputs. Since the function works correctly for the provided examples and the formula used is accurate, the program is correct for every potential case within the scope of the given problem description.
