Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly. The formula used is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\), which is the standard formula for the volume of a triangular prism. Since the function implements this formula accurately and there are no conditions or edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the function needs to handle differently, the function works correctly for all potential cases.
