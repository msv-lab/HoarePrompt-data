Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to create the new tuple. This approach correctly implements the described functionality for any input tuple of length \(N+1\), where \(N\) is a positive integer. 

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

- Input: `(1, 2, 3, 4)`
- Expected output: `(2, 6, 12)` (which is the result of \(1*2\), \(2*3\), \(3*4\))

The function works as expected in this case and handles all potential cases where \(N \geq 1\). Since the function correctly generates the desired output for any valid input tuple, the program is correct.
