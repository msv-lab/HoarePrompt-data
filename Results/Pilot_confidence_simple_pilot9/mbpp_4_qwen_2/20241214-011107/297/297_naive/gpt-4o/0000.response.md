Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality. For each input tuple, it generates a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function handles tuples of various lengths, including tuples with a single element, which results in an empty tuple as specified. All provided assertions pass, and there are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle correctly based on the problem description.
