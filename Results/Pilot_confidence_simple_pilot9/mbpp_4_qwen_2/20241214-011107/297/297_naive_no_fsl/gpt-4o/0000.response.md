Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. For each input tuple `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function returns a tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element is the product of `t_i` and `t_{i+1}`. 

- In the first test case, `func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))` returns `(5, 35, 56, 80)`, which matches the expected output.
- In the second test case, `func_1((2, 4, 5, 6, 7))` returns `(8, 20, 30, 42)`, which also matches the expected output.
- In the third test case, `func_1((12, 13, 14, 9, 15))` returns `(156, 182, 126, 135)`, which again matches the expected output.
- For the empty tuple case `func_1((12,))`, the function returns an empty tuple `()`, which is the expected behavior since the length of the resulting tuple would be `N = 0`.

The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to create the new tuple, iterating through the input tuple up to the second-to-last element and multiplying each element with its successor. This implementation handles all provided test cases and the edge case of a single-element tuple correctly. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.
