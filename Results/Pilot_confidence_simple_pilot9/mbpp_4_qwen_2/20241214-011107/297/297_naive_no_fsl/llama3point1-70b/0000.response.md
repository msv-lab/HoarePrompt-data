Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. This matches the problem description exactly. For any input tuple `(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with its successor, and then multiplies them together using a generator expression inside the `tuple()` constructor. This approach ensures that the output tuple will have a length of `N`, which is consistent with the problem description. Since the function behaves as specified for all inputs, the correctness is **True**.
