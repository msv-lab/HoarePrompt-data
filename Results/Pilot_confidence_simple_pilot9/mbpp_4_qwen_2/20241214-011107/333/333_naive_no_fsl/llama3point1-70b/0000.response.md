Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each closing bracket matches the last unmatched opening bracket. The function handles all potential cases where the expression could be balanced or unbalanced, including edge cases such as empty strings, strings with only opening brackets, and strings with mismatched brackets. Since the function correctly implements the logic for checking balanced expressions, it meets the requirements for every potential case.
