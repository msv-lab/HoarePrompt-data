Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced by using a stack to match opening and closing brackets. It handles all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and works as expected. For instance:

- `{()}[{}]` is correctly identified as balanced.
- `{()}[{]` is correctly identified as unbalanced due to the mismatch between `[` and `}`.
- `{()}[{}][]({})` is correctly identified as balanced.

The function also accounts for nested and sequential pairs of brackets, ensuring that the entire expression is evaluated correctly. Since the function works correctly for the provided assertions and no other potential cases were found where the function fails, the code is correct.
