Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`. The program uses a stack to keep track of opening symbols and ensures they are properly matched with their corresponding closing symbols. 

- For the input `'{()}[{}]'`, the program returns `True` as expected.
- For the input `'{()}[{]'`, the program returns `False` as expected because the expression is not balanced.
- For the input `'{()}[{}][]({})'`, the program returns `True` as expected.

The program handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and seems to work correctly for all potential cases involving balanced and unbalanced expressions.
