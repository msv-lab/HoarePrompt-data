Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced by using a stack to match opening and closing brackets. It supports multiple types of brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets) and handles cases where the expression might contain different types of brackets. The function returns `False` as soon as it encounters an unbalanced bracket, ensuring that the entire expression is checked. Finally, it ensures that the stack is empty at the end, indicating that all opened brackets have been properly closed. This implementation covers all potential cases as per the problem description.
