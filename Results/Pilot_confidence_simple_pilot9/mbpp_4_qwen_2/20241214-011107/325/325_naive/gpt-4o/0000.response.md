Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days. The set `months_with_30_days` contains the numbers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which are the months that have 30 days. The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set and `False` otherwise. Given the assertions provided:

- `func_1(6)` returns `True`, which is correct because June (month 6) has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False`, which is correct because February (month 2) typically does not have 30 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because December (month 12) does not have 30 days.

Since the function works correctly for the provided test cases and the logic is sound, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
