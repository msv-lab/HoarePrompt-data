Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a given month number contains 30 days. The function uses a list `[4, 6, 9, 11]` which correctly represents the months that have 30 days. For each month number from 1 to 12, the function returns `True` if the month is in the list and `False` otherwise. This covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the function works correctly for all given month numbers.
