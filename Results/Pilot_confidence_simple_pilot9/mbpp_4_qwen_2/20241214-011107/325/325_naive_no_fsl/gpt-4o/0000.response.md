Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. It uses a set `months_with_30_days` which contains the numbers of months that have 30 days: 4, 6, 9, and 11. The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. This logic aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should check if the given month number contains 30 days.

Given the assertions:
- `func_1(6)` returns `True`, which is correct because June has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False`, which is correct because February typically does not have 30 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because December does not have 30 days.

Since the function works correctly for the provided test cases and follows the logic for determining if a month has 30 days, the program is correct.
