Correctness: **False**

The program checks if the given month is in the list of months that have 30 days (April, June, September, November). However, it does not account for February (month 2), which does not have 30 days. Additionally, July (month 7) and December (month 12) are also not included in the list but have different day counts. Therefore, this program will incorrectly identify months like July and December as having 30 days, which they do not.
