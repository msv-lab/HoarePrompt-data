Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in alphabetical order, ignoring case sensitivity. This is achieved using a list comprehension that sorts each sublist with `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)`. 

Given the problem description, this function correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner. There are no potential edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail as long as the input adheres to being a list of lists where each element is a list of strings. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for all possible cases described in the problem.
