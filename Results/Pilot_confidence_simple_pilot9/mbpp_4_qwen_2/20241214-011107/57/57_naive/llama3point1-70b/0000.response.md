Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist and applies the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` to sort the strings in a case-insensitive manner. This approach handles all potential cases as long as the input is valid (i.e., a list of lists where each element is a list of strings). There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the given problem description.
