Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to apply the `sorted()` function to each sublist. Given the provided test cases:

1. `assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`
2. `assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`
3. `assert func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])) == [['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`

The function works correctly in all provided cases. Sorting each sublist as required by the problem description, and handling whitespace by treating them as part of the string during sorting, the function performs as expected. Since no counterexample has been found where the function does not meet the requirements, the program is correct.
