Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters with odd index values from the given string. It uses a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate over the string, selecting only characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This meets the problem description of removing characters with odd index values for any given string. Since there is no counterexample where the function fails to meet the requirement, the program is correct.
