Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters with odd index values from the given string. It uses list comprehension to iterate over the string, selecting only characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), and then joins them back into a string. The provided test cases cover various scenarios including different lengths of strings and different character sets. Since the function behaves as expected in all tested cases and the logic appears sound, there are no identified issues that would cause the program to fail for any potential case.
