Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. It iterates over the string, selecting only characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), and joins them together to form a new string. This approach works for any input string and always produces the expected output according to the problem description. There are no edge cases or potential inputs where this function would fail based on the given problem statement.
