Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The examples given in the assertions cover various scenarios, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and a mix of both. The function handles these cases correctly without any issues. Given that the function appears to work as expected for the provided test cases and the logic seems sound, there are no apparent cases where the program does not meet the problem description.
