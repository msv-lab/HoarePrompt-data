Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The assertions provided in the code cover a few different scenarios, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and a mix of both. Given the implementation and the test cases, the function appears to handle these cases correctly. There doesn't seem to be any obvious edge case or scenario that would cause the function to fail based on the provided problem description and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
