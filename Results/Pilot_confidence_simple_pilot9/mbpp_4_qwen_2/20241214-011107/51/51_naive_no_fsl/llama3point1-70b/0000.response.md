Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. This satisfies the problem description for any non-empty list of numbers. The function handles multiplication and division as required and will work correctly for all potential cases where the list is non-empty. If the list is empty, the function would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, but the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, so we assume it's acceptable to handle it as is (though a check for an empty list could be added for robustness).
