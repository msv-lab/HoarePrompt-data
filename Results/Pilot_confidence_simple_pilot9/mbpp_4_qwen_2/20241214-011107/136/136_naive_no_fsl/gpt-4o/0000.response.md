Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The assertions in the code cover several scenarios:

1. When `n` is 170, the function returns a dictionary including entries with values 175, 180, and 190.
2. When `n` is 180, the function returns a dictionary including entries with values 180 and 190.
3. When `n` is 190, the function returns a dictionary including only the entry with value 190.

These examples cover various cases and demonstrate that the function works as intended for the given problem description. Since no counterexample was found where the function does not meet the requirements, the code is correct.
