Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The dictionary comprehension used in the function ensures that only those key-value pairs that meet the condition `v >= n` are included in the returned dictionary. Since the function handles all potential cases as per the problem description, there is no scenario where the program fails to work as expected.
