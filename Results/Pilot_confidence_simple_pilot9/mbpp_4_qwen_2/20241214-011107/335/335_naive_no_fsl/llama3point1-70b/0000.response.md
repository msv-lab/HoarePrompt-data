Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring and calculates the ending index accordingly. Since the function handles all cases where the substring is present or not, and it returns `None` in the latter case, the program meets the requirements for every potential input.
