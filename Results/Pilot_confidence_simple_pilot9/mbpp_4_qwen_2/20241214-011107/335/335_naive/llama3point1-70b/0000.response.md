Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring and then calculates the end index. This approach handles all cases where the substring exists in the string, and it returns `None` if the substring is not present. There doesn't seem to be any logical flaw or missing edge case in the given implementation.
