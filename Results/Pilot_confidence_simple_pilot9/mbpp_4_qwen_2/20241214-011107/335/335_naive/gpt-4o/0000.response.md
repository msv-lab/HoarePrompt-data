Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the substring and its positions in the main string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function works as expected for all the provided test cases and there doesn't seem to be any logical flaw or edge case that the function fails to handle.
