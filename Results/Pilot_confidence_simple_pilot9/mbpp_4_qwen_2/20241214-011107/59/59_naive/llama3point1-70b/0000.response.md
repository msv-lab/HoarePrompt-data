Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` merges three lists into a single list and then sorts it using the built-in `sorted` function. This approach is correct and will work for any potential input lists, as the `sorted` function ensures that the resulting list is always sorted regardless of the contents of the input lists. There are no edge cases or special conditions that this function does not handle, and it meets the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios.
