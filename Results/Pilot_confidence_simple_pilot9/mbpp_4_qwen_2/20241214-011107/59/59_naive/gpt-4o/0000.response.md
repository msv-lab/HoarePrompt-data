Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function first combines the three input lists into one list using `list1 + list2 + list3`, and then sorts this combined list using `sorted()`. This approach ensures that the resulting list is sorted and contains all elements from the three input lists. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function works correctly for different sets of input lists. Since the function handles the merging and sorting correctly without any issues identified, it can be concluded that the program is correct according to the problem description.
