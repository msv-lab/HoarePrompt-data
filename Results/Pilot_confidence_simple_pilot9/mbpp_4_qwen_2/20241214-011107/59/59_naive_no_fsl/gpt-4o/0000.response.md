Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function first combines the three input lists into one using the `+` operator, and then sorts the combined list using the `sorted` function. The examples provided in the problem description show that the function works correctly for different sets of input lists. There are no apparent issues with the logic or edge cases that would cause the function to fail for any potential input. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for merging and sorting the lists as described.
