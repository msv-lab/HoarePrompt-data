Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes three lists as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted()` function. This approach ensures that the merged list is sorted, which aligns with the problem description of merging three lists into a single sorted list. Since the function works correctly for any combination of input lists, there is no potential case found where the program does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the code is correct.
