Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two numbers `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple where the second number comes first followed by the first number. The assertions provided in the code cover several test cases:

- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`

Each assertion checks the function with different pairs of numbers, and the function behaves as expected in all cases. Since the function correctly swaps the order of the two input numbers to form the required tuple, and the provided test cases cover various scenarios without any issues, the program is correct. There doesn't seem to be any missing logic or edge cases that this code is not handling.
