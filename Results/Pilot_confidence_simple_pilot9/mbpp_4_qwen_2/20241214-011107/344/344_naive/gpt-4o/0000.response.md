Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses `bisect.bisect_right` from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. This function returns the index where the value should be inserted to keep the list sorted. Based on the problem description, this approach is correct and handles all potential cases. The assertions provided in the comments also validate the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, there are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.
