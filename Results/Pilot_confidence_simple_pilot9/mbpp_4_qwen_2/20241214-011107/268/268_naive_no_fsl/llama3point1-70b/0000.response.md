Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of the matrix. The function uses a generator expression to access the n'th element of each row (note that list indices are zero-based, so `row[n - 1]` correctly references the n'th column). It then passes this generator to the `max()` function, which returns the maximum value found.

Given the problem description, there doesn't seem to be any edge cases or potential scenarios where this function would fail. For any valid matrix and a valid column index `n`, the function will operate correctly. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
