Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses `n - 1` to access the n'th column, which is incorrect. In Python, list indexing starts at 0, so the n'th column should be accessed using `row[n]`. This means the program will fail for any valid `n` because it incorrectly accesses the column. For example, if `n = 1`, the program will attempt to access `row[0]`, which is not the first column but the zeroth column.

To fix this, the program should be modified to:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n] for row in matrix))
```

This corrected version will correctly find the maximum value in the n'th column of the matrix.
