Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `str.count()` method to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string. This approach is correct and will handle all cases as described in the problem statement. The examples provided also confirm that the function works as expected for various inputs, including empty strings and strings with multiple occurrences of 'std'. Since the function correctly counts the occurrences of 'std' in all given examples and the logic appears sound, the program is correct.
