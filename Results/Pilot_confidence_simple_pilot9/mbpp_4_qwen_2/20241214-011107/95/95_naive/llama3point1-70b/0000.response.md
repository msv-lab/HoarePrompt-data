Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string using the built-in `count` method. This method handles all potential cases, including overlapping occurrences and edge cases like empty strings or the search string not being present in the given string. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
