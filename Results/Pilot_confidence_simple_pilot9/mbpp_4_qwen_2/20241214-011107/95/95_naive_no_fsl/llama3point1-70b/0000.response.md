Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s` using the built-in `count` method. This method will handle all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as empty strings, strings without the substring 'std', and strings with multiple instances of 'std'. Since the function works as expected for all possible inputs, the program is correct.
