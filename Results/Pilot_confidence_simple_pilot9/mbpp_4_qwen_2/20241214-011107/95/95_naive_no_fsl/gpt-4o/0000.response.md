Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of strings to count the occurrences of the substring 'std'. This approach correctly counts the number of times 'std' appears in the input string `s`. Given the test cases:

- `func_1('letstdlenstdporstd') == 3`: Correct, as 'std' appears 3 times.
- `func_1('truststdsolensporsd') == 1`: Correct, as 'std' appears 1 time.
- `func_1('makestdsostdworthit') == 2`: Correct, as 'std' appears 2 times.
- `func_1('stds') == 1`: Correct, as 'std' appears 1 time.
- `func_1('') == 0`: Correct, as 'std' does not appear in an empty string.

Since the function behaves as expected for all provided test cases and the general logic is sound, the program is correct.
