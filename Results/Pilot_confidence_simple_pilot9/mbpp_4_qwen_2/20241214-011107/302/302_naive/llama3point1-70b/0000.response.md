Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program iterates through the sorted array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. It returns the index of the first occurrence of the given number. If the number is not found, it returns `-1`. This approach works correctly for finding the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array because:

- The array is sorted, so once the number is found, it will be the first occurrence.
- The loop will stop as soon as it finds the number, ensuring that the first occurrence is returned.

Since the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, the correctness is **True**.
