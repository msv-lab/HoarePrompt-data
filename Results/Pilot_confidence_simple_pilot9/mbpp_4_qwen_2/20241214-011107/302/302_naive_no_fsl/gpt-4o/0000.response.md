Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The assertions provided in the test cases cover different scenarios such as the target being present multiple times in the array, and the target being equal to the boundary elements of the array. 

The function correctly handles these cases:
- In the first assertion, the target `5` appears multiple times, and the function returns the correct index `1`.
- In the second assertion, the target `5` also appears multiple times, and the function returns the correct index `2`.
- In the third assertion, the target `6` is found at index `4`, which is its first occurrence.

Since the function behaves correctly for the provided test cases and the logic of a binary search for finding the first occurrence of a target in a sorted array is sound, we can conclude that the function is correct for all potential cases within the given problem description.
