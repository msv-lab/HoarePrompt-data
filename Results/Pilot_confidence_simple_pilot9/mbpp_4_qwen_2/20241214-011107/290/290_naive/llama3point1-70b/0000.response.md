Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if a string contains the character 'z' (excluding the first and last characters of each word). The program splits the input string into words and then iterates through each word, checking if the substring excluding the first and last character contains 'z'. If such a word is found, it immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, it returns `False`.

This implementation handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies whether any word within the string has 'z' in the middle part of the word. There are no edge cases or special scenarios mentioned in the problem description that this program fails to address.
