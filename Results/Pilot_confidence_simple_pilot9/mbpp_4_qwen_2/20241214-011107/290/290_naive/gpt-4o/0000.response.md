Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the character 'z' (excluding the first and last characters). The function uses slicing `s[1:-1]` to exclude the first and last characters and then checks if 'z' is present in this substring. Given the test cases:

- `func_1('pythonzabc.') == True` is correct because 'z' is present in the middle of the string.
- `func_1('zxyabc.') == False` is correct because 'z' is at the beginning of the string.
- `func_1('  lang  .') == False` is correct because 'z' is not present in the middle of the string.

Since the function works as expected for the provided test cases and the logic appears to cover the described requirement without any obvious edge cases that would make it incorrect, the program is correct.
