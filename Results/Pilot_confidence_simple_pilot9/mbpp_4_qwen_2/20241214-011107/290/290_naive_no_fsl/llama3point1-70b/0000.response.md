Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the letter 'z' (excluding the first and last characters) for each word in the input string. Given the problem description, the function splits the input string into words and then checks each word individually. It returns `True` if any word contains 'z' in the middle part and `False` otherwise. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential scenario where this function would fail based on the provided description. Therefore, the function appears to be correct.
