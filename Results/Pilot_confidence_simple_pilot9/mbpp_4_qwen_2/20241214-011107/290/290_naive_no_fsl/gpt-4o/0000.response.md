Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where 'z' appears at positions other than the start and end of the string. According to the problem description, 'z' should only be allowed in the middle of the string (i.e., not at the first or last character). However, the current implementation checks for 'z' within `s[1:-1]`, which is correct. 

The issue lies in the test cases provided:
- `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True`, which is correct since 'z' is not at the start or end.
- `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False`, which is also correct since 'z' is at the start.
- `func_1('  lang  .')` returns `False`, which is correct since there is no 'z' in the string at all.

However, consider the following case:
- `func_1('xyzabc.')` should return `False` because 'z' is not at the start or end, but the current implementation would return `True`.

To ensure the function works correctly, it should explicitly check that 'z' is not at the start or end of the string:
```python
def func_1(s):
    if s.startswith('z') or s.endswith('z'):
        return False
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False
```

This updated version ensures that 'z' is only considered valid if it is not at the start or end of the string.
