Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the first element of each sublist in the given list of sublists. Given the problem description, the function should return a list containing the first element from each sublist. The list comprehension in the function iterates over each sublist and extracts the first element, which satisfies the problem requirements for any input list of sublists. Since there are no edge cases or special conditions mentioned, and the function works as expected for all tested cases, the function is correct.
