Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the given list of lists. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` iterates over each sublist in `lst` and collects the first element of each sublist into a new list. This implementation works for all the provided test cases and should handle any potential case where each sublist contains at least one element. Since the program meets the requirements for all given examples and no counterexample has been found, the program is correct.
