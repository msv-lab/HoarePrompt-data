Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of sublists as input and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist. This function works correctly for all potential cases where the input is a list of sublists. Here are a few scenarios to validate this:

1. When the input is an empty list of sublists:
   ```python
   sublists = []
   result = func_1(sublists)
   # Expected output: []
   ```

2. When the input is a list with non-empty sublists:
   ```python
   sublists = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
   result = func_1(sublists)
   # Expected output: [1, 3, 5]
   ```

3. When the input is a list with a single empty sublist:
   ```python
   sublists = [[]]
   result = func_1(sublists)
   # Expected output: []
   ```

4. When the input is a list with a single non-empty sublist:
   ```python
   sublists = [[1, 2, 3]]
   result = func_1(sublists)
   # Expected output: [1]
   ```

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
