Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly retrieves the first element of each sublist for the given test cases. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` iterates over each sublist in the input list `lst` and selects the first element of each sublist. Since the provided test cases cover different lengths of sublists and the function works as expected for these cases, we can conclude that the function meets the requirements for the given problem description in all tested scenarios.
