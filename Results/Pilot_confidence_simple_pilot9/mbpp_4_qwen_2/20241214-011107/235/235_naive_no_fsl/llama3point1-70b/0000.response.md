Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and then sums these integers. This approach works for all non-negative integers, including edge cases like 0, single-digit numbers, and large numbers. Since the function handles all tested cases correctly, the program is correct.
