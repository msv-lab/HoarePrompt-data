Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function iterates through each digit of the input number by using modulo and integer division operations, which ensures that all digits are summed correctly. The assertions provided also cover various cases, including different lengths of integers and different sums. Since the function handles these cases correctly and the provided examples work as expected, the program is correct for the given problem description.
