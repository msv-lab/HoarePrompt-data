Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The function iterates through all integers from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index \( i \) is even using the condition `i % 2 == 0`, and if so, adds the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{i} \) to the sum. This logic aligns with the problem description and works for all potential cases of positive integers \( n \). There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the given problem statement.
