Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is indeed the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). This can be derived from the binomial theorem and properties of binomial coefficients. Specifically, the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients in the expansion of \((1+1)^n\) is \(2^{(n-1)}\).

Given the test cases:
- For \(n = 4\), the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients is \(2^3 = 8\).
- For \(n = 6\), the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients is \(2^5 = 32\).
- For \(n = 2\), the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients is \(2^1 = 2\).

These test cases confirm that the function works correctly for the provided inputs. Since the function adheres to the problem description for the tested cases and there are no other potential edge cases mentioned that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
