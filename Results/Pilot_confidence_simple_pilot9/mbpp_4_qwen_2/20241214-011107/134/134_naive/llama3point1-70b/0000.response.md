Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The program iterates through all possible binomial coefficients from \( \binom{n}{0} \) to \( \binom{n}{n} \), and since it only adds those with even indices, it satisfies the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs where this program would fail to meet the requirements.
