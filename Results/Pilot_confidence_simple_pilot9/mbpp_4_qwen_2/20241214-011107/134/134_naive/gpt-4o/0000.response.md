Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The formula used, \( 2^{(n-1)} \), is derived from the properties of binomial coefficients. For any positive integer \( n \), the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices is indeed \( 2^{(n-1)} \).

Given the assertions provided:
- `func_1(4) == 8` (since \( 2^{(4-1)} = 2^3 = 8 \))
- `func_1(6) == 32` (since \( 2^{(6-1)} = 2^5 = 32 \))
- `func_1(2) == 2` (since \( 2^{(2-1)} = 2^1 = 2 \))

These assertions confirm the correctness of the function for the given inputs. Since the program follows the problem description accurately and the mathematical property holds for the general case, the program is correct.
