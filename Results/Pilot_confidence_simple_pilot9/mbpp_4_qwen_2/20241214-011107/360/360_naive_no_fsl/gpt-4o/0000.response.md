Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The function iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates the maximum sum and corresponding sublist whenever a new maximum is found. The given test cases cover different scenarios including lists with varying lengths and values, and the function passes all these tests. There doesn't appear to be any missing logic or edge cases that would cause the function to fail based on the provided problem description and examples.
