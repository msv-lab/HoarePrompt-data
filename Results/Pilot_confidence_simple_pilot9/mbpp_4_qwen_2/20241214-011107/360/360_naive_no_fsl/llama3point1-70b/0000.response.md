Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The `max` function with `key=sum` ensures that the list with the maximum sum is returned. This solution works for all potential cases where the input is a non-empty list of lists. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would make this function incorrect based on the problem description.
