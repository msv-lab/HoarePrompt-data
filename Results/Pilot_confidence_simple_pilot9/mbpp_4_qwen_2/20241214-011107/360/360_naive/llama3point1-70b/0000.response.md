Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements among the lists in the input. The `max` function with `key=sum` will return the list whose elements' sum is the maximum. This approach works for all potential cases where the input is a list of lists. There is no edge case or specific input that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
