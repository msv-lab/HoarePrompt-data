Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum of elements in a list of lists. The logic in the function iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates the maximum sum and corresponding sublist whenever a higher sum is found. This approach ensures that the function will work correctly for any given list of lists, as demonstrated by the provided test cases. There are no edge cases or inputs that this function would fail to handle based on the problem description.
