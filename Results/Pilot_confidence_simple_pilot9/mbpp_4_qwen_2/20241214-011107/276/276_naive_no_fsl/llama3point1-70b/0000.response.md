Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both lists are empty. According to the problem description, the function should find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. If both lists are empty, the function should raise an error or return `None` since there are no elements to calculate the median. However, the current implementation will attempt to sort an empty list, which is valid but does not meet the problem's requirements for handling empty inputs.

To fix this, you could add a check at the beginning of the function to return `None` or raise an error when either list is empty:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    if len(list1) == 0 or len(list2) == 0:
        return None  # or raise ValueError("Lists cannot be empty")
    
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
