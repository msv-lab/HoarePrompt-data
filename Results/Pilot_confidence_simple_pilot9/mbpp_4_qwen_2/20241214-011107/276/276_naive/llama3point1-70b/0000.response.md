Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` has a logical error when calculating the middle index. Given that both input lists are of the same size, the correct middle index should be `size // 2` instead of `size - 1`. This error will lead to incorrect results for odd-sized lists. For example, if both `list1` and `list2` are `[1, 3]`, the function will return the second element instead of the average of the two middle elements, which should be `(1 + 3) / 2 = 2`.

To fix this, the line should be changed to:
```python
middle_index = size // 2
```
