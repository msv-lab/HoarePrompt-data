Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program removes lowercase substrings from a given string but does not correctly handle cases where there are consecutive uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, consider the string `'PYThon'`. The expected output would be `'PThn'`, but the program will only remove the lowercase letter `'th'` and leave the uppercase `'Py'`, resulting in `'PTh'`. This shows that the program does not handle the removal of lowercase substrings correctly in all cases.
