Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not remove lowercase substrings as described in the problem statement. Instead, it only keeps uppercase characters and removes all other characters. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program will return "HW", which does not meet the requirement of removing all lowercase substrings. A correct implementation would remove any substring consisting entirely of lowercase characters. 

For instance, if the input is "abc", the program should return "", but the current implementation returns "abc" because it only filters out individual lowercase characters, not substrings.
