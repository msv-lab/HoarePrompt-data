Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` removes all lowercase substrings from the given string and retains only the uppercase characters. The examples given (`'PYTHon' -> 'PYTH'`, `'FInD' -> 'FID'`, `'STRinG' -> 'STRG'`) demonstrate that the function works as expected for the described problem. Since the function correctly handles the given examples and the logic is straightforward without any missing edge cases, we can conclude that the program is correct for every potential case described by the problem.
