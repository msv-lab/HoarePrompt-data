Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle lowercase substrings as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only keeps uppercase characters and discards all lowercase characters, which does not meet the requirement to remove lowercase substrings entirely. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program will return "HelloWorld" instead of removing the lowercase substring "ello".
