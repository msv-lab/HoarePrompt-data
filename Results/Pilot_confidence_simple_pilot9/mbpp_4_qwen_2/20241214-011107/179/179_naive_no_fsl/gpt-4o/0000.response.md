Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Let's verify this:

- For `n = 2`, the even numbers are `[2, 4]`. Their cubes are `[8, 64]`, and their sum is `72`. The function returns `72`, which matches the assertion.
- For `n = 3`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`. Their cubes are `[8, 64, 216]`, and their sum is `288`. The function returns `288`, which matches the assertion.
- For `n = 4`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. Their cubes are `[8, 64, 216, 512]`, and their sum is `800`. The function returns `800`, which matches the assertion.

The function uses list comprehension to generate the even numbers and a generator expression within the `sum` function to calculate the cube sum. This approach is efficient and correct. Since the provided test cases and the logic of the function cover the basic requirement and no edge cases were found that would make the function incorrect, the program is correct.
