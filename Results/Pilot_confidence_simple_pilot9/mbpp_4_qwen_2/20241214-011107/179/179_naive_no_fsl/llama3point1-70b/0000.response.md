Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's a breakdown:

- The function uses a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` to generate the cubes of the first `n` even numbers.
- `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers starting from 2 up to `2n`.
- `sum()` then adds these cubes together.

To validate this, consider the following cases:
1. For `n = 1`, the function should return \(2^3 = 8\).
2. For `n = 2`, the function should return \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
3. For `n = 3`, the function should return \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).

The function works correctly for these and other potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
