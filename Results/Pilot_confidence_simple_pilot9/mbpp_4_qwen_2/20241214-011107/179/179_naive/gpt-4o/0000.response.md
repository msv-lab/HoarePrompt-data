Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. It then calculates the cube of each number in this list using a generator expression `(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` and sums them up using the `sum` function. The assertions provided also confirm the correctness of the function for the given inputs. Since the function seems to work correctly for the provided examples and no edge cases were found that would make the function incorrect, the program is correct.
