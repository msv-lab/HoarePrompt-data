Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The formula used in the program generates even numbers starting from 2 up to `n * 2`, and then computes the cube of each number before summing them up. This approach ensures that the program works correctly for any positive integer value of `n`. Hereâ€™s a brief verification:

- For `n = 1`, the program returns \(2^3 = 8\).
- For `n = 2`, the program returns \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
- For `n = 3`, the program returns \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).

Since the program follows the problem description for all tested cases and no counterexamples were found, the program is correct.
