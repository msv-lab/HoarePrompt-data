Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. This exactly matches the problem description. Since the function uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor, it will work correctly for any pairs of tuples of the same length. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail as long as both input tuples are of the same length. Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description.
