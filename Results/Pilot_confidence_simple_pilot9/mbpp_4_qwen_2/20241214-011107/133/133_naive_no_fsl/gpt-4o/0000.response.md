Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to perform the subtraction operation element-wise using `zip`. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including positive numbers and negative results, and the function passes all the assertions. Since the function works correctly for the given examples and the implementation logic seems to handle the described task accurately without any edge cases being missed, the program is correct.
