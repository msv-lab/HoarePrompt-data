Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the subtraction of corresponding elements from two tuples. It uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to perform the subtraction for each pair of elements from the input tuples. The function works for the provided test cases and seems to handle tuples of varying lengths by using `zip`, which stops at the shortest tuple. Since no specific edge cases were mentioned in the problem description and the function passes all the provided assertions, the function appears to be correct for the given requirements.
