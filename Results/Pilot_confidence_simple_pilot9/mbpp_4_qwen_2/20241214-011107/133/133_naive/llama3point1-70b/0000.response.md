Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. Given two tuples of the same length, the program uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples and computes their difference using a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor. This approach ensures that the operation is performed correctly for all elements as long as the input tuples are of equal length. Since no edge cases or potential issues arise from this implementation, the program meets the requirements for all possible valid inputs.
