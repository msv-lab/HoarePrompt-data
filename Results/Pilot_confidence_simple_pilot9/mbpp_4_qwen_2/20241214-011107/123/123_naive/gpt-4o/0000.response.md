Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. The function uses list slicing to achieve this, which is a straightforward and efficient approach. The examples given cover different scenarios including a list of integers and a list of characters. The function works correctly for these examples and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
