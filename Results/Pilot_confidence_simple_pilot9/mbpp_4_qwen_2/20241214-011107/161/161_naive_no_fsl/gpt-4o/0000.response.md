Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the n'th Lucas number correctly for the given test cases, but the Lucas sequence is defined such that L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1, and for n > 1, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2). However, the function does not handle negative inputs. According to the problem description, the program should work for every potential case, including negative inputs, which are typically not handled in the Lucas sequence. 

For example, if we consider `func_1(-1)`, the function should ideally either raise an error or handle it gracefully, but the current implementation will cause an infinite loop or undefined behavior since the loop will never terminate. Thus, the function is not correct for every potential case.
