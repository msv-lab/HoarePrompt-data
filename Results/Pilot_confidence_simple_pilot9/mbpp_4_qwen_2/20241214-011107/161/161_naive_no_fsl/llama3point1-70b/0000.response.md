Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function correctly implements the Lucas sequence. The Lucas numbers are defined such that \(L(0) = 2\), \(L(1) = 1\), and for \(n > 1\), \(L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\). The function handles the base cases \(n = 0\) and \(n = 1\) correctly, and for \(n > 1\), it iteratively computes the Lucas numbers using a loop, which matches the definition. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs for which this function would fail based on the provided problem description.
