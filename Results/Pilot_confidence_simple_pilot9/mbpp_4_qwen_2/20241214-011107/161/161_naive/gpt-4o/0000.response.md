Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program calculates the n-th Lucas number using an iterative approach. However, the program does not handle the case when `n` is negative. According to the problem description, the function should be able to handle any non-negative integer input. Since the program does not account for negative values of `n`, it will raise a `TypeError` when called with a negative argument. For example, calling `func_1(-1)` would result in an error. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
