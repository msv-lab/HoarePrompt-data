Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly compute the n-th Lucas number for all cases. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. However, the program has an off-by-one error in the loop that iterates to calculate the n-th Lucas number. Specifically, the loop should run from `2` to `n`, but the update of `b` happens outside the loop's bounds. This causes the final value of `b` to be incorrect for most values of `n`.

To fix this, the loop should be updated as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n):  # Change here
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

With this correction, the program will correctly compute the n-th Lucas number for all valid inputs.
