Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The `all()` function in Python returns `True` if all elements of the iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty). In this context, it will return `True` if all items in the list `lst` are equal to `element`. There are no edge cases or potential inputs where this function would fail to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
