Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists at every nth element. The assertions provided in the problem description cover several cases, including different list sizes and different values of n. The implementation uses modulo operation to cycle through the indices of the result list, which ensures that elements are distributed evenly across the sublists. Since the provided code works for the given examples and the logic seems sound for splitting the list, we can conclude that the program is correct for every potential case described.
