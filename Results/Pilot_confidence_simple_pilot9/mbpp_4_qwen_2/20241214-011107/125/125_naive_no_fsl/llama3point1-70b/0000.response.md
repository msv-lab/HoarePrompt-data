Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not split the list every nth element as described. Instead, it creates a list of sublists where each sublist starts from every position `i` (for `i` in `range(n)`) and includes elements at intervals of `n`. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`, the output will be `[[], [1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`, which is not the expected behavior. The expected behavior would be to split the list such that every nth element forms a new sublist. For instance, with the same `lst` and `n`, the expected output should be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
