Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not split the list into sublists every nth element but rather it splits the list based on the index modulo n. This means that for `n=3`, it will group elements at indices 0, 3, 6, etc., together; indices 1, 4, 7, etc., together; and so on. However, the problem description asks for splitting the list such that each new sublist contains every nth element starting from the first element of the original list. 

For example, if we have the list `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` and `n=3`, the expected output would be `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`. However, the current implementation groups the elements differently:
- First sublist: `['a', 'b', 'c']`
- Second sublist: `['d', 'e', 'f']`
- Third sublist: `['g', 'h', 'i']`
- Fourth sublist: `['j', 'k', 'l']`
- Fifth sublist: `['m', 'n']`

To achieve the desired behavior, the function should iterate through the list and group every nth element together, not by their indices modulo n.
