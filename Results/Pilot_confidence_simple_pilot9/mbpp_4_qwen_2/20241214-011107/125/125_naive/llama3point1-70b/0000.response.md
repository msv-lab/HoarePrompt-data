Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to split a list into sublists every nth element. However, the logic in the program has a flaw. Specifically, the program uses a list comprehension that starts slicing from each index `i` up to the end of the list with a step of `n`. This will not achieve the intended result of splitting the list every nth element.

For example, consider the following input:
- `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`.

The expected output would be:
```
[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]
```

However, the current implementation will produce:
```
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [3, 4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [5, 6], [6]]
```

This is because the list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` starts from each index `i` and slices the list with a step of `n`, which does not align with the requirement of splitting the list every nth element.

A correct implementation should use a different approach to achieve the desired result. For instance, you could iterate through the list and construct the sublists accordingly. Here's an example of a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(lst), n):
        result.append(lst[i:i+n])
    return result
```

This corrected version will correctly split the list every nth element.
