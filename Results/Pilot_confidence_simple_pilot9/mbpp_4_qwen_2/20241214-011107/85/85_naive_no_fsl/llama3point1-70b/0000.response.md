Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach correctly computes the maximum difference for any given array of integers or floats. Since the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and there are no edge cases that would make it fail, the program is correct.
