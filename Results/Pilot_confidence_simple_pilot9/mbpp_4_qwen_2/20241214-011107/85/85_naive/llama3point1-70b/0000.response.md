Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach works for all potential cases since the maximum difference in an array will always be the difference between the largest and smallest elements. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the problem description.
