Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and returns their difference. This approach works for any array of integers, as long as the array has at least two elements. The examples provided also demonstrate its correctness:

1. For the array `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `5`, so the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`.
2. For the array `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `9`, so the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
3. For the array `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `3`, so the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Since the program handles all these cases correctly and the logic is sound, it is correct for every potential case within the problem description.
