Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a set to store the month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the input month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. The given test cases cover January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which are all months with 31 days. The function also correctly returns `False` for February (2) and June (6), which do not have 31 days. Since the function works correctly for all the provided cases and logically handles the requirement, it is correct.
