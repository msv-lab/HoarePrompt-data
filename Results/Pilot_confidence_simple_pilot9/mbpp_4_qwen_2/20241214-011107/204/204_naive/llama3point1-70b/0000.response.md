Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a given month number contains 31 days by seeing if it is in the list of month numbers that have 31 days. This logic is correct and covers all potential cases for month numbers that contain 31 days. The function returns `True` for month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, which are the only month numbers with 31 days. For all other month numbers (2, 4, 6, 9, 11), it returns `False`, which is also correct according to the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
