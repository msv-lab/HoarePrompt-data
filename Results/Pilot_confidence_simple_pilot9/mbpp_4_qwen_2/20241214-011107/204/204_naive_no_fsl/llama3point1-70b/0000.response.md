Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days. The list `months_31_days` contains all the month numbers (1-12) that have 31 days. The function returns `True` if the input month number `n` is in this list, and `False` otherwise. Since the function handles all possible month numbers from 1 to 12 and returns the correct boolean value for each, the program is correct according to the problem description.
