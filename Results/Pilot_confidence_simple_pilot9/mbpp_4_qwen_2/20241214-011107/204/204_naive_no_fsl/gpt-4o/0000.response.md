Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` which includes the numbers corresponding to months with 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set and `False` otherwise.

The provided test cases cover all the months with 31 days and those without 31 days:
- February (2) is correctly identified as having fewer than 31 days.
- April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11) are correctly identified as having fewer than 31 days.
- January (1), August (8), October (10), and December (12) are correctly identified as having 31 days.

Since the function behaves as expected for all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and there are no edge cases provided that would cause the function to fail, the program is correct.
