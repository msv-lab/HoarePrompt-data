Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function converts the integer to a string to iterate over each digit, counts the frequency of each digit, and then verifies if the frequency is less than or equal to the digit value. All the provided test cases (`func_1(1234) == True`, `func_1(51241) == False`, `func_1(321) == True`) are handled correctly. Additionally, the logic seems sound and should cover all potential cases for the given problem description.
