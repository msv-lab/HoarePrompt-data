Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a set to remove duplicates and then sums the elements. The assertions provided also correctly demonstrate this functionality. Since the function works for the given examples and the logic is sound, it should handle any list of integers without issues related to duplicates. Therefore, the program is correct.
