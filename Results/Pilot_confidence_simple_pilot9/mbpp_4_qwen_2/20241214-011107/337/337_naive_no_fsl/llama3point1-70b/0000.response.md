Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. For any input list, the function uses a generator expression to iterate through each element `i` in the list `lst`, checking if `i` appears exactly once using `lst.count(i) == 1`. If an element is unique, it is included in the sum. This logic ensures that only non-repeated elements are summed.

Given the problem description and the function's implementation, there are no apparent edge cases or inputs where the function would fail to meet the requirement. Therefore, the function is correct for all potential cases.
