Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses `sum(set(lst))` to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. While this approach works for the given test cases, it has a flaw. The set data structure removes duplicate elements but does not maintain the original order or count of elements. Therefore, it might not work correctly for lists where the order of elements matters or when the count of each element is significant.

For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The set will contain `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`, and the sum will be correct in this case. However, if the list were `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]`, the set would also contain `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, and the sum would be correct here too. But if the requirement is to sum the unique elements regardless of their count, this method works. However, if the requirement is to sum the non-repeated elements considering their counts, the method fails.

To ensure correctness, we need to handle the count of each element. A better approach would be to use a dictionary to count occurrences and then sum only those elements with a count of 1.
