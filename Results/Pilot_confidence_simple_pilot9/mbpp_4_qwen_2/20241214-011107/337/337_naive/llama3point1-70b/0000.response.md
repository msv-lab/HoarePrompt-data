Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. For any given list, the program uses a generator expression to filter out elements that appear more than once using `lst.count(i) == 1`, and then sums these unique elements. This approach ensures that only elements that appear exactly once in the list are included in the sum. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or specific input scenario where this program would fail based on the problem description.
