Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a list contains consecutive numbers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then it sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each element is exactly one greater than the previous element. The provided test cases cover several scenarios:

1. A list with consecutive numbers (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`) returns `True`.
2. A list with missing consecutive numbers (`[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`) returns `False`.
3. A list with duplicate numbers (`[1, 2, 1]`) returns `False`.

These test cases cover the basic requirements. Additionally, the function handles the edge case of an empty list correctly. Given these points, the function appears to work correctly for all potential cases of consecutive number checking.
