Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the given list contains consecutive numbers. Here's how it works:

1. It sorts the list.
2. It checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1.
3. It ensures that all elements in the list are unique (by comparing the length of the list with the length of the set of the list).

This approach correctly identifies whether the list contains consecutive numbers, considering both the order and uniqueness of the elements. There are no potential cases found where this program would fail to meet the requirements described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
