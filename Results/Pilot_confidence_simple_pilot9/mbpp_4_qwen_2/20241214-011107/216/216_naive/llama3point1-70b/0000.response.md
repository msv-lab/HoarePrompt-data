Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. The function first sorts the list and then uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is exactly 1. Additionally, it verifies that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list, ensuring no duplicates exist. This approach correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers, including handling cases with duplicates and non-consecutive sequences. Since the function works correctly for all potential cases based on the given problem description, the correctness is True.
