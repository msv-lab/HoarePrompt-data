Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then, it sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each element is exactly one greater than the previous element. The provided test cases also cover different scenarios:

1. A list with consecutive numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` returns `True`.
2. A list with a missing consecutive number `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` returns `False`.
3. A list with duplicate values but not consecutive `[1, 2, 1]` returns `False`.

The function handles these cases correctly and should work for any other potential cases of consecutive numbers in a list. Therefore, the program is correct.
