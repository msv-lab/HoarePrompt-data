Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function in Python. According to the problem description, the function should take a single character as input and return its ASCII value as an integer. The function meets this requirement for any valid single character input. Since there is no potential case found where the program does not work as expected, the code is correct.
