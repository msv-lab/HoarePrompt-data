Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). The formula used for `r` is the Euclidean distance formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), and for `θ` it uses the `math.atan2(y, x)` function which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the implementation. Since the program handles all tested cases correctly and the mathematical formulas are accurate, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
