Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function `func_1` implements this formula accurately by importing the `math` module and using the constant `math.pi`. There is no potential case identified where this function would fail to meet the problem description, as it handles the conversion for any given degree value.
