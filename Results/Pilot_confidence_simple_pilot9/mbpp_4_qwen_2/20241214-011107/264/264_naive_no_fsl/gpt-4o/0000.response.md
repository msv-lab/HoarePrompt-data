Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The given test cases assert that the function returns the expected values for 90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees. Since the function uses the correct mathematical conversion and the test cases cover typical angles, we can infer that the function works correctly for any degree value. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
