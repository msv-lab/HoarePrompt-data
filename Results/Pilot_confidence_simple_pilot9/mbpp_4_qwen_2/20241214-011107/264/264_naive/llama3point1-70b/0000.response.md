Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula is mathematically accurate and will work for any input value of degrees. Since the function correctly implements the required conversion for all possible inputs, it meets the problem description for every potential case.
