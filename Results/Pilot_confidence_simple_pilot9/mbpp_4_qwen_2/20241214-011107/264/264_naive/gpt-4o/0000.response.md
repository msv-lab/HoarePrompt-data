Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The assertions provided in the program verify this conversion for specific values (90, 60, and 120 degrees), which map to \( \frac{\pi}{2} \), \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), and \( \frac{2\pi}{3} \) radians respectively. Since the program follows the expected formula and the provided test cases work as expected, the program is correct for the given problem description.
