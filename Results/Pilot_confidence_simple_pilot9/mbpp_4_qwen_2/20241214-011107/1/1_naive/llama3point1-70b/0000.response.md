Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses sets to find the intersection of the two tuples and returns it as a tuple. However, this approach might not handle all potential cases correctly. For example, consider the following inputs:

- `test_tup1 = (1, 2, 3, 4)` and `test_tup2 = (3, 4, 5, 6)`
- `test_tup1 = (1, 2, 3, 4)` and `test_tup2 = (5, 6, 7, 8)`

In the first case, the shared elements are `(3, 4)`, which the program will return correctly. However, the program does not guarantee the order of the elements in the output tuple. The elements in the result could be returned in any order, which might not be what the problem description expects.

In the second case, since there are no shared elements, the program will return `()`, which is correct.

To ensure the program works as expected in all cases, the function should maintain the order of elements as they appear in the original tuples. A corrected version could be:

```python
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    result = []
    for elem in test_tup1:
        if elem in test_tup2 and elem not in result:
            result.append(elem)
    return tuple(result)
```

This version ensures that the order of elements in the result matches their order in the original tuples.
