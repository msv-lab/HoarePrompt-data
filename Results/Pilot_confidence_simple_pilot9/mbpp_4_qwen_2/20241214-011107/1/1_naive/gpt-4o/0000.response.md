Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the shared elements from the two given lists as tuples. The function uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists and then converts the result back into a sorted tuple. This approach handles all potential cases where elements can be repeated in both lists and ensures that the output is consistent and ordered. Given the examples provided, the function works correctly for the specified inputs, and no other edge cases or potential issues could be identified that would cause the function to fail.
