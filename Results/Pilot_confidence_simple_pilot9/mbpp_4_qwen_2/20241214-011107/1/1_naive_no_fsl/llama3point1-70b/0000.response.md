Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) as input and returns a tuple containing the shared elements between them. This is achieved by converting both tuples into sets, finding their intersection using the `&` operator, and then converting the result back into a tuple. This approach correctly identifies and returns all elements that are present in both input tuples.

Since the function works as expected for all potential cases (i.e., it correctly finds shared elements in any pair of tuples), the program is correct.
