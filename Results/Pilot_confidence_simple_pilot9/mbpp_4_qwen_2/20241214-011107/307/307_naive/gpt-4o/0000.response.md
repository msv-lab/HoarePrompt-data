Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The formula for the `k`-th triangular number is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \). The program iteratively increases `k` until it finds a triangular number with exactly `n` digits, which matches the problem description. Given the provided test cases, the function returns the correct results for `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`. Since the program appears to handle all tested cases correctly and the logic seems sound, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct for the given problem description.
