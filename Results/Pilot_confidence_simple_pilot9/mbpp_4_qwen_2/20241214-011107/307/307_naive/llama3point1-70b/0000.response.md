Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is defined as the sum of the natural numbers up to a certain point, and the formula used is \(\frac{idx \times (idx + 1)}{2}\). The program iterates, incrementing `idx` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`. Given this logic, the program will correctly identify the smallest triangular number with `n` digits and return its index. There are no apparent edge cases or misinterpretations of the problem description that would cause the program to fail.
