Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is defined as the sum of the natural numbers up to a certain point (i.e., \( T_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \)). The program iteratively computes these triangular numbers and returns the index once the triangular number has at least `n` digits. Since the program handles the calculation and digit check correctly and the logic is sound, it meets the problem description for any valid input `n`.
