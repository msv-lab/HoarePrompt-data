Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates through natural numbers `k`, calculates the corresponding triangular number, and checks its digit length. When it finds the first triangular number with `n` digits, it returns the index `k`.

To verify this, let's consider a few cases:

- For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10 (which is the 4th triangular number, i.e., \(T_4 = 10\)). The function correctly returns 4.
- For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 165 (which is the 14th triangular number, i.e., \(T_{14} = 105\), but the next one is \(T_{15} = 120\), and \(T_{16} = 136\), and so on). The function correctly returns 14.
- For `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 1035 (which is the 45th triangular number, i.e., \(T_{45} = 1035\)). The function correctly returns 45.

Since the program handles these cases correctly and the logic appears sound, we can conclude that the program is correct for finding the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.
