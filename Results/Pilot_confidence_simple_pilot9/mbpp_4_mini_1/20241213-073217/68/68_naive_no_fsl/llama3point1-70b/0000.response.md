Correctness: **True**

The provided function correctly implements the calculation of the angle of a complex number using Python's `cmath` module. The function `func_1` takes two arguments: the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs the complex number using the `complex()` function and then uses `cmath.phase()` to return the argument (or angle) of the complex number in radians.

The function covers all potential cases of complex numbers, including:

1. A complex number with a zero real part and positive imaginary part (e.g., `func_1(0, 1)` results in an angle of π/2).
2. A complex number with a zero real part and negative imaginary part (e.g., `func_1(0, -1)` results in an angle of -π/2).
3. A complex number with both real and imaginary parts being zero (e.g., `func_1(0, 0)`). The angle for this case is defined to be 0, which is consistent with the mathematical convention.
4. Complex numbers in all four quadrants (positive/negative real and imaginary parts).

Thus, after considering the various cases, I determine that the program functions correctly according to the problem description.
