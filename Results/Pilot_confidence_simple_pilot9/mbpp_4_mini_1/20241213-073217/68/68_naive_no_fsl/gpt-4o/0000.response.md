To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the program itself:

The task is to create a function that gets the angle of a complex number. The angle (or phase) of a complex number can be obtained using the `cmath.phase` function, which returns the angle in radians.

The provided program does the following:

1. It imports the necessary libraries `cmath` and `math`.
2. It defines a function `func_1(real, imag)` that takes two parameters, one for the real part and one for the imaginary part of a complex number.
3. Inside `func_1`, it creates a complex number using the built-in `complex` function and then calculates its phase using `cmath.phase`.
4. There are assertions that test the function with specific complex numbers and their expected angles.

Now, let's consider possible inputs to the function `func_1`:

- The function should work correctly for the entire range of complex numbers, including those with negative and zero values.
- Edge cases to consider:
  - (0, 0) → This is a special case, as the angle of zero (the origin in the complex plane) is undefined. How the `cmath.phase` function handles this case should be validated.
  - Negative and positive imaginary values, as well as negative real values.

Now, we can check if the function handles these edge cases properly.

Let’s check the case of (0, 0):
```python
assert not math.isclose(func_1(0, 0), anything) # Should maybe raise an error or not return a clear angle
```
The phase of (0, 0) is undefined, and calling `func_1(0, 0)` would return 0, which might not represent the undefined behavior accurately.

Given that the function does not handle this edge case appropriately, the program fails to meet the specifications in all potential cases.

Based on this analysis, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
