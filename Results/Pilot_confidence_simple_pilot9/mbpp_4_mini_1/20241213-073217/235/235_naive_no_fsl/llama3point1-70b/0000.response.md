Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly sums the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer `n` to a string to iterate through each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and then sums them up using the `sum` function. 

Here are some test cases to illustrate its correctness:
- For input `123`, the program calculates `1 + 2 + 3`, resulting in `6`.
- For input `0`, the program returns `0`, since there are no digits to sum.
- For input `9999`, the program calculates `9 + 9 + 9 + 9`, resulting in `36`.

Since the program handles all possible non-negative integers correctly, there are no missed edge cases, and it adheres to the problem description. Hence, the output is True.
