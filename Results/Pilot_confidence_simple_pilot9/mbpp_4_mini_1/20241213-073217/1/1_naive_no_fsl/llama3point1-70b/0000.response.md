To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1`.

The function is supposed to find the shared elements between two lists (in this case, tuples). The implementation uses the intersection of sets derived from the two input tuples. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Input Types**: The function `func_1` takes two tuples as arguments. It converts these tuples into sets, which allows for efficient computation of the intersection.
  
2. **Functionality**: The expression `set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2)` computes the intersection of two sets, giving the shared elements between them. The result is then converted back to a tuple.

3. **Output**: It returns a tuple of shared elements. If there are no shared elements, it returns an empty tuple.

Now, let's consider various cases:

1. **Both Tuples Empty**: `func_1((), ())` → returns `()`, which is correct since there are no shared elements.

2. **One Empty Tuple**: `func_1((1, 2, 3), ())` → returns `()`, which is correct as there are no shared elements.

3. **No Shared Elements**: `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))` → returns `()`, which is correct.

4. **Some Shared Elements**: `func_1((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4))` → returns `(2, 3)`, which is correct.

5. **All Elements Shared**: `func_1((1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3))` → returns `(1, 2, 3)`, which is correct.

6. **Different Data Types**: `func_1((1, 2, 'a'), (2, 'a', 3))` → returns `(2, 'a')`, which is correct as it finds the shared elements of different types.

The function handles all the above cases correctly. It adequately processes the two input tuples and returns a tuple of shared elements. 

Considering all the example cases provided, I couldn't find any potential case where the implementation does not work as expected. Thus, the function fulfills the requirements set by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
