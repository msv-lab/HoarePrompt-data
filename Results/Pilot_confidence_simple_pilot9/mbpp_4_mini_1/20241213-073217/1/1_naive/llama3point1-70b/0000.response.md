Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly finds the shared elements between two lists by utilizing sets. It creates sets from both input lists and uses the intersection operator `&` to find common elements. The result is then converted back into a tuple, as required. 

This implementation handles typical cases such as:
- Both lists being disjoint (resulting in an empty tuple).
- One or both lists being empty (also yielding the correct empty tuple).
- Lists containing duplicate elements (since sets automatically remove duplicates).

Hence, the program meets the problem description in all potential scenarios.
