Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists. It utilizes a set intersection to determine common elements, which is an efficient approach. The final output is sorted and converted to a tuple, as required.

The existing assertions validate the functionality with diverse input examples and confirm that the program behaves as expected. Since I can't identify any case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that it is correct.
