Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Hereâ€™s why it works for every potential case:

1. The function iterates through each element of the `sorted_list`.
2. It checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified `value`.
3. If such an element is found, it returns the index of that element, which is the correct insertion point.
4. If the loop completes (meaning the value is greater than all existing elements in the list), it returns `len(sorted_list)`, which is the correct index where the value should be inserted at the end.

Test cases show that it handles various scenarios, including:
- Inserting in the middle of the list.
- Inserting at the start if the value is smaller than the first element.
- Inserting at the end if the value is larger than the last element.
- Handling of duplicates correctly by placing the new value at the first occurrence of an equal value.

Since there is no case that breaks the stated requirements, the program works correctly for all valid inputs.
