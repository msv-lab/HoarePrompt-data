Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method, which is designed to locate the insertion point for `value` in the sorted list. According to the problem description, it explicitly states that the function should locate the right insertion point in sorted order.

To further elaborate on the behavior of this function:

1. **Example Cases**:
   - For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the correct output is `4`, since `6` should be inserted at the end of the list, which is position 4 (the index of the next available position).
   - For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, it correctly returns `2`, indicating that `3` should be inserted at index `2`.
   - For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, it returns `4`, which is also correct, as `7` should be placed after all existing values.

2. **General Cases**:
   - The function properly handles values that are smaller than the smallest element (`1` in this case) by returning `0`.
   - Values equal to elements in the list will be placed to the right of those duplicates, which is consistent with the usage of `bisect_right`.

Since all tested assertions pass and the function operates according to the defined behavior of `bisect.bisect_right`, I can confidently affirm that the implementation meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. Thus, it is deemed correct for all potential cases in the specified context.
