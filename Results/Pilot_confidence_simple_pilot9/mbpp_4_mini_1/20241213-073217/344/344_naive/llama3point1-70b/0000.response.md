To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to examine if it successfully locates the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list.

The provided program is:

```python
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Insertion Point Logic**:
   - The function iterates through `sorted_list`, checking if the current element is greater than or equal to the `value`.
   - If it finds an element that is greater than or equal to `value`, it returns the current index `i`, which would be the correct insertion point.
   - If it completes the loop without finding any element greater than or equal to `value`, it returns `len(sorted_list)`, which indicates that `value` should be placed at the end of the list.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `sorted_list` is empty, it should return `0` as the insertion point, which it does.
   - If `value` is less than all elements in `sorted_list`, it will correctly return `0`.
   - If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, it will correctly return `len(sorted_list)`.
   - If `value` is equal to an element in `sorted_list`, it will return the index of the first occurrence which is correct.

### Potential Issue:
While the logic seems mostly correct, there's one subtle problem related to the edge case where the `value` is equal to an element in the sorted list. If there are multiple occurrences of the `value`, the function returns the index of the first occurrence, which is fine. So, that part works correctly. 

However, the function does not handle the case when `sorted_list` is not sorted, but that is not part of the problem description; we assume the input will always be sorted.

Thus, we do not find any case where the program fails to meet the problem requirement.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program, it meets the problem description for all tested potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
