Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is intended to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size, but it does not handle cases where the size of the input lists is incorrect. Specifically, the assertions assume that the lists `list1` and `list2` are of the same length as the provided integer `n`. 

For example, if we were to call `func_1([1, 2], [3, 4, 5], 2)`, where the second list is of a different size than specified (the first list has 2 elements while the second has 3), the function does not raise any error or handle this case, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or output. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem description as it does not account for the correctness of the input sizes. Therefore, it is incorrect.
