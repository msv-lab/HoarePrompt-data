To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we will analyze the function and its behavior.

The problem requires a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The provided program combines the two lists, sorts them, and then calculates the median based on the size of the resulting merged list.

1. **Combining the lists:** The code correctly merges the two sorted lists into one.
2. **Sorting the combined list:** The merged list is sorted correctly.
3. **Finding the median:**
   - If the length of the merged list is even, the code correctly averages the two middle elements.
   - If the length is odd, the code returns the middle element.

Let’s consider edge cases where the input lists may have repeated values or equal values. 

### Edge Case 1: Lists with Repeated Values
- For example:
  ```python
  assert func_1([1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], 3) == 1.0  # median should be 1.0
  ```

### Edge Case 2: All Elements Same
- For example:
  ```python
  assert func_1([5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], 3) == 5.0  # median should be 5.0
  ```

### Edge Case 3: Large Numbers
- For example:
  ```python
  assert func_1([100, 200, 300], [400, 500, 600], 3) == 350.0  # median should be 350.0
  ```

### Edge Case 4: Negative Numbers
- For example:
  ```python
  assert func_1([-10, -5], [-3, -1], 2) == -4.0  # median should be -4.0
  ```

### Edge Case 5: Empty Lists
- This case isn’t applicable, but if it were part of the problem, it might need handling.

After examining various edge cases and considering special scenarios such as repeated numbers and large/small integers, it remains clear that the logic for calculating the median is sound and that the function will return the correct median for the specified cases. Each test case mentioned holds true.

Thus, after thorough consideration and review of cases, the function behaves as expected for all tested inputs.

Correctness: **True**
