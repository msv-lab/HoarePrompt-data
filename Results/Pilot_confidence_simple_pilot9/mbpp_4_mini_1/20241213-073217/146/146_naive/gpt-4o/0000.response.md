To analyze the provided program against the problem description, let's first reiterate the requirements: 

**Problem description**: Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.

Now, let's scrutinize the provided program:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
    return (max_len, max_list)
```

The function initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list. It iterates over each list in `list_of_lists`. For each list, if its length exceeds the current `max_len`, it updates `max_len` and sets `max_list` to this new list. Finally, it returns a tuple with the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.

### Case Analysis

Let's consider some potential cases:

1. **Empty input**: 
   - If `list_of_lists` is empty (`[]`), the function will not enter the for-loop, leaving `max_len` as 0 and `max_list` as an empty list. The return value should be `(0, [])`. 
   - This case meets the expected behavior.

2. **Multiple lists of the same length**:
   - For input `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`, all lists have a length of 2. The current implementation will return `(2, [5, 6])`, which is correct.
   - However, if there are lists of the same maximum length, it does only return the last one, not the first. The problem does not specify what to do in this case, so this behavior might be acceptable depending on interpretation.

3. **All empty lists**:
   - For the input `list_of_lists = [[], [], []]`, the function would return `(0, [])`, which again is correct.

Overall, the function correctly identifies lists by length and returns the expected results in various scenarios, especially edge cases like empty inputs.

### Conclusion

After examining the function in various cases, it appears to be correct as it successfully returns the length and the longest list from the provided list of lists. There is no scenario provided that demonstrates incorrect behavior.

Correctness: **True**.
