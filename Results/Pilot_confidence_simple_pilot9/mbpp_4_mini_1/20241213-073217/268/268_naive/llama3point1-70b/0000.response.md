To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the provided code against the problem description.

**Problem description:** Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

**Analysis:**

1. **Understanding the code**: The function `func_1` takes a `matrix` (list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value from the n-th column of the matrix. 
   
2. **1-based index consideration**: The code accesses the n-th column with `row[n - 1]`, which correctly adjusts for Python's 0-based indexing.

3. **Potential issues**:
    - **Invalid column index**: If `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in the matrix, it will lead to an `IndexError`. For example, if the input matrix is `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `n` is `3`, this will raise an error.
    - **Empty matrix**: If the input `matrix` is empty (i.e., `matrix = []`), calling `max()` on an empty iterable will raise a `ValueError`.

Given these edge cases, we can conclude that the provided program does not handle inputs correctly for scenarios when the column index `n` is out of bounds or if the matrix is empty.

Thus, the result of the correctness check is:

Correctness: **False**.
