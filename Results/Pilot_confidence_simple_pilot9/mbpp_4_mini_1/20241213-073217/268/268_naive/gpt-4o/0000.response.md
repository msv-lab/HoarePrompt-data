Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is intended to return the maximum value of the nth column from a given matrix. However, there is a potential issue if the column index `n` is out of bounds for the rows in the matrix. For example:

1. If `n` is greater than the number of columns available in any row, an `IndexError` will occur when trying to access `row[n]`.

For instance:
- Calling `func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 3)` would cause an `IndexError` since there is no valid index 3 in the rows of this matrix.

This shows that the program does not adequately handle cases where `n` exceeds the length of the rows, making it incorrect.
