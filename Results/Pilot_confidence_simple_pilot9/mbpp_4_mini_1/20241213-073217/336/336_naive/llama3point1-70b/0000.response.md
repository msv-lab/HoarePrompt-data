Correctness: **False**.

The function is supposed to check whether every odd index in the given list contains odd numbers. However, it does not handle the case where the list might contain odd numbers at odd indices, but less than two elements, which essentially means the function could return True under incorrect conditions. 

For example:
- Input: `lst = [1, 2, 3]`  
  - The function checks index 1 (which is odd), finds that `lst[1] == 2` which is even, and correctly returns `False`.
  
- Input: `lst = [1]`  
  - The function does not check any odd indices (since there is no element at an odd index), and therefore defaults to returning `True`, which is incorrect because it does not validate the case where no odd number exists at an odd index.

Similarly, for `lst = []` (empty list), the result will also be True, which is misleading because there are no elements to confirm the requirement. Thus, the function may have missing logic in both edge cases and more general conditions where it can falsely validate lists with odd lengths resulting in an odd index with no checks. Hence, the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in these scenarios.
