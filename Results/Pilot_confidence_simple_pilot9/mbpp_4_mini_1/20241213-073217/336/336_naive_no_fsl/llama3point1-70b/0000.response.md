To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the requirement and what the code does.

**Problem Description:** Check whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function iterates through each index of the list.
2. It checks if the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
3. If the index is odd and the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), it returns `False`.
4. If the function finishes iterating without finding any such case, it returns `True`.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- The function does not specify what it should do for an empty list. However, returning `True` for an empty list could be considered valid since there are no odd indices.
- If there are no odd indices (for example, if the list has only even-length), the function correctly returns `True`, as it wonâ€™t evaluate anything.
- If `lst` contains non-integer types, such as strings or floats, the function will throw an error when trying to evaluate `lst[i] % 2`. The function lacks type-checking.

**Counterexample:**
- Consider the input list `lst = [1, 2, 3]`. 
    - The index 1 (odd) has the value 2, which is even. The function should return `False` for this input, and it does.
- For the input `lst = [1, 3, 5]`, the function correctly returns `True` since all odd indices (1) contain odd numbers.
- However, consider `lst = [1, 4, 3]`. The odd index 1 contains 4 (even), so it correctly returns `False`.
  
The main issue arises if the list contains non-integer types. For example, `lst = [1, 'a', 3]` will throw a type error due to the string not being an integer.

Considering these points, since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly lists containing non-integer values, it fails to adhere to the problem description in every possible case.

Correctness: **False**
