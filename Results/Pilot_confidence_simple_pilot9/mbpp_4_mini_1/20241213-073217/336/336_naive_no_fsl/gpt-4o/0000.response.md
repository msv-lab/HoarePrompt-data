Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` is supposed to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. However, the implementation has a logical flaw. 

Let's consider the following case: 

```python
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
```

Here, the list has odd indices: 1 (value 1), 3 (value 3), 5 (value 7), and 7 (value 3). In this case:
- The value at index 1 is 1 (odd).
- The value at index 3 is 3 (odd).
- The value at index 5 is 7 (odd).
- The value at index 7 is 3 (odd).

Thus `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` returns True as expected.

Next, look at the case: 

```python
func_1([2, 0, 4, 3, 6, 8, 6, 1]) 
```

For this list:
- The value at index 1 is 0 (even).
- The value at index 3 is 3 (odd).
- The value at index 5 is 8 (even).
- The value at index 7 is 1 (odd).

The function should return False because some values at odd indices (0 and 8) are even. However, testing this will show that it does return False correctly, but only if every odd index is correctly identified and checked.

However, we need to consider not just the cases that the original assertions provide but also whether the implementation correctly validates all odd indices against being odd. The original assertions do not cover edge cases such as an empty list or a list with negative numbers or zeros, which also need to be considered.

An empty list should return True because there are no odd indices to evaluate, yet it does not handle that.

In summary:
1. The code does not account for an empty list, which should return True but is not handled.
2. There might be edge cases such as lists of varying sizes or with negative numbers where results are not as expected based on the condition provided.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not fully validate the problem requirements for all potential cases.
