Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. The `func_1` function iterates over each element in the list (`lst`) and uses the `count` method of the tuple (`tup`) to get the number of occurrences of each element. The `sum` function then adds these counts together, giving the total occurrence count.

The function works for various cases, including:
- When the list is empty, it correctly returns 0 since there are no elements to count.
- When the tuple is empty, it returns 0 as well, since there are no elements to count in the tuple.
- When elements in the list are not present in the tuple, it takes care of that as the `count` method will return 0 for those elements.

Examples:
1. `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), [2, 3])` returns 3 (2 appears twice and 3 appears once).
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3), [4, 5])` returns 0 since neither 4 nor 5 is in the tuple.
3. `func_1((), [1, 2])` returns 0 because the tuple is empty.

Since every potential case I could think of yields the expected results, the program is deemed correct.
