To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's first analyze the functionality.

The problem requires a function that:
1. Rounds every number in a given list of numbers.
2. Computes the total sum of the rounded numbers.
3. Multiplies this total sum by the length of the list.
4. Returns the final computed value.

Now let's check the provided function, `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]   # Rounds each number
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)                    # Sums the rounded numbers
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)                   # Multiplies the sum by the length of the list
    return result
```

The function seems to perform the necessary steps as described in the problem statement:
- It rounds each number using `round(num)`.
- It calculates the sum of the rounded numbers.
- It multiplies that sum by the number of elements in the list.

Next, let's consider some potential edge cases:
1. **Empty list**: If we pass an empty list `[]`, the function will attempt to calculate the length (which is 0) and the sum (which is also 0). Hence, it will return `0 * 0 = 0`, but we need to ensure the specification doesn't omit handling this case. Since the input might yield a fundamentally different type of result or raise an error (which the problem description doesn't mention), we need to confirm it's accounted for.
2. **Negative numbers**: The program needs to correctly handle the rounding of negative numbers.
3. **Exact half numbers**: Numbers like `0.5`, `1.5`, etc., should round correctly.

Let's run a couple of test cases, including the edge case:

1. `func_1([])` should give `0` (not specified in the problem).
2. `func_1([0.5, 1.5])` should yield `2 * 2 = 4` since both round to `1` and `2`.

The output of these test cases indicates that there's a lack of clarity about behavior for an empty list, which was not addressed in the problem description.

Since the program does not handle all cases according to the problem description, particularly with the empty list leading to a potentially ambiguous or undesired outcome, we can conclude that it is not correct.

Correctness: **False** 

Specifically, the program does not define behavior for an empty input list, which could lead to unexpected results in certain contexts.
