Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It rounds each number in the list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies the sum by the length of the original list. 

### Explanation:
1. The function accepts a list of numbers as input.
2. It uses a list comprehension to round each number, which will handle both positive and negative numbers accurately.
3. It calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers using the `sum` function.
4. Finally, it multiplies this total sum by the length of the original list, which is also correctly calculated using `len(numbers)`.

The rounding operation via the `round` function and subsequent calculations are executed without any apparent edge cases that would cause failure or incorrect results based on the problem description. Thus, for every input provided to the function, it behaves as expected.
