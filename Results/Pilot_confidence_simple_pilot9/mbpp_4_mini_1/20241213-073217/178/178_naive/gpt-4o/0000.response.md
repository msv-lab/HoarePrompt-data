Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the input list, sums them, and multiplies the total sum by the length of the list. The provided test cases confirm its functionality:

1. For the input `[22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]`, the rounded numbers are `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]`, which sums to `27`. Multiplying by the length of the list (9) gives `243`.

2. For the input `[5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]`, the rounded numbers are `[5, 2, 9, 24, 29]`, which sums to `69`. Multiplying by the length of the list (5) gives `345`.

3. For the input `[25.0, 56.7, 89.2]`, the rounded numbers are `[25, 57, 89]`, which sums to `171`. Multiplying by the length of the list (3) gives `513`.

There are no edge cases provided in the description, and the program handles common cases as described, including positive, negative, whole, and decimal numbers. Thus, the implementation meets the problem description requirements.
