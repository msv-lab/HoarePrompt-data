Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the problem description of rounding each number in the list and then multiplying the total sum by the length of the list. 

Here's why the code is correct:
1. It rounds each number in the input list using `round(num)`.
2. It calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers with `sum(rounded_numbers)`.
3. It multiplies this total sum by the length of the original list using `len(numbers)`.

All the steps align with the problem's requirements, and no edge cases or potential inputs will cause the function to behave incorrectly based on the logic implemented. The function handles all scenarios properly, including lists with zero elements or negative numbers.
