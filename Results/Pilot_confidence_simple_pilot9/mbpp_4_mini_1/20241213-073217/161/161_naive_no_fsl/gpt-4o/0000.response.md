To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, I will analyze the function `func_1` to ensure it correctly computes the n-th Lucas number.

The sequence of Lucas numbers is defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n â‰¥ 2

Now, let's review the implementation in `func_1`:

1. When `n == 0`, it returns 2, which is correct.
2. When `n == 1`, it returns 1, which is also correct.
3. For `n >= 2`, it uses a loop to compute the Lucas number:
   - It initializes `a` to L(0) = 2 and `b` to L(1) = 1.
   - The loop runs from 2 to `n`, updating `a` and `b` to compute the next Lucas number. The assignment `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` correctly computes the next Lucas number since it follows the recurrence relation.

Now, we check the provided assertions:
- `func_1(9)` should return L(9) = 76, which is correct.
- `func_1(4)` should return L(4) = 7, which is also correct.
- `func_1(3)` should return L(3) = 4, which is correct as well.

We should also test additional cases and edge cases to ensure that the program behaves as expected:
- For instance, `func_1(2)` should return L(2) = 3, and `func_1(5)` should return L(5) = 11.

Given these considerations and the correctness of the function for various test cases, I have established that no inputs led to unexpected behavior and all edge cases are handled.

Therefore, based on this analysis:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly implements the computation of the n-th Lucas number according to the provided problem description.
