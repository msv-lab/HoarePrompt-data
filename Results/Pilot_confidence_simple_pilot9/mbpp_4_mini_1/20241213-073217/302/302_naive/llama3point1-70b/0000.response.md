Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It uses a simple linear search, which is appropriate for this task, as the problem statement does not require optimized performance for sorted arrays. 

Here's why it works for all potential cases:
1. If the number exists in the array, it returns the index of its first occurrence.
2. If the number does not exist, it correctly returns -1.
3. The program correctly handles cases where the array is empty or consists of repeated elements.

For instance:
- For an input array `[1, 2, 2, 3]` and searching for `2`, it will return `1`, which is the index of the first occurrence.
- For an input array `[1, 2, 3]` and searching for `4`, it will correctly return `-1`.

Since I cannot identify any cases where the program fails to meet the requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.
