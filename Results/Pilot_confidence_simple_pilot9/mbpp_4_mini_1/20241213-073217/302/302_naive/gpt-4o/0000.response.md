To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it based on the provided problem description.

**Problem Description:** Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

**Assertion Tests:**
- `func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1` (Expected: first occurrence of 5 is at index 1)
- `func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2` (Expected: first occurrence of 5 is at index 2)
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4` (Expected: first occurrence of 6 is at index 4)

### Analysis:
1. **Function Logic:**
   - The function employs a binary search strategy to find the target in a sorted array.
   - It correctly updates the result when it finds the target and continues to search towards the left of the array to find the first occurrence by adjusting `high`.

2. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - If the target is not present, it will return -1, which is appropriate.
   - The function also correctly handles cases where the target appears multiple times by updating `high`.
   - However, if an empty array is passed, the function will return -1, which is correct behavior for that edge case.

### Testing for Additional Cases:
- Testing with an empty array: `func_1([], 5)` should return `-1`, which is correct.
- Testing with numbers not in the array: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)` should also return `-1`.

Based on the analysis above, there do not appear to be any cases where the function fails to meet the requirements of finding the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, handles multiple occurrences correctly, and manages edge cases appropriately.
