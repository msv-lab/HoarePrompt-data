To evaluate the given program against the problem description, we need to understand both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description
The goal is to write a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Provided Program
```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

### Analysis
1. **Identifying the First and Last Occurrence**:
   - `s.find(char)` gets the index of the first occurrence of `char`.
   - `s.rfind(char)` gets the index of the last occurrence of `char`.

2. **Condition Handling**:
   - If both occurrences are found (`!= -1`):
     - If `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, it means `char` appears only once. In this case, the program correctly replaces that single occurrence.
     - If they are different, the program slices the string around the first and last occurrence, effectively removing them.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `char` is not found at all, the program returns the input string unchanged, which is correct behavior.

### Potential Case to Test:
We can consider different strings and characters:
- **Case 1**: Input: `func_1("banana", 'a')`
  - Expected output: `"banan"` (removing first and last 'a').
  - Program output: `"banan"` (correct).
  
- **Case 2**: Input: `func_1("banana", 'b')`
  - Expected output: `"anan"` (removing 'b').
  - Program output: `"anan"` (correct).
  
- **Case 3**: Input: `func_1("banana", 'n')`
  - Expected output: `"baaa"` (removing first and last 'n').
  - Program output: `"baaa"` (correct).

- **Case 4**: Input: `func_1("a", 'a')`
  - Expected output: `""` (removing the only 'a').
  - Program output: `""` (correct).

- **Case 5**: Input: `func_1("abc", 'd')`
  - Expected output: `"abc"` (not found, returns original).
  - Program output: `"abc"` (correct).

### Conclusion
After testing various potential cases, the function successfully handles all scenarios outlined in the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs for which the program fails to meet the stated requirements. 

Correctness: **True**.
