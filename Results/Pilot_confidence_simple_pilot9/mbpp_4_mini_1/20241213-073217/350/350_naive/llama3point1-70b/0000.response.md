To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze if the program indeed finds the last position of an element in a sorted array.

### Analysis of the Program:
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```
1. The function iterates through the array `arr` in reverse from the last index to the first.
2. If it finds an element equal to `target`, it returns the index `i`.
3. If the element is not found after checking all elements, it returns `-1`.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Target is in the array:**
   - Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `target = 3`
   - Output should be `2` (correct, as `3` is at index `2`).

2. **Target is not in the array:**
   - Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `target = 6`
   - Output should be `-1` (correct, as `6` is not present).

3. **Multiple occurrences of the target:**
   - Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5]`, `target = 3`
   - Output should be `4` (correct, as the last `3` is at index `4`).

4. **Target at the beginning:**
   - Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `target = 1`
   - Output should be `0` (correct, as `1` is at index `0`).

5. **Empty Array:**
   - Input: `arr = []`, `target = 1`
   - Output should be `-1` (correct, as the array is empty).

6. **Target is the only element:**
   - Input: `arr = [1]`, `target = 1`
   - Output should be `0` (correct, as `1` is at index `0`).

7. **Target is negative:**
   - Input: `arr = [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]`, `target = -3`
   - Output should be `2` (correct, as `-3` is at index `2`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles searching for the last position of a target in a sorted array based on the outlined problem description and is able to manage edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**.
