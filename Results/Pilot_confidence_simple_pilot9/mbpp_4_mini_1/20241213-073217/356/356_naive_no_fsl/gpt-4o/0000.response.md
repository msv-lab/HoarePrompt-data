Correctness: **False**

The program does not account for all types of whitespace characters. It only removes spaces (' ') from the input string using the `replace` method. However, the problem description specifies the need to remove "all whitespaces," which includes not only spaces but also tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), and other forms of whitespace.

For example, the input string `'python\t   program\n'` contains tabs and a newline character, which the current implementation would leave untouched. Therefore, the output would not be as expected, violating the requirement to remove all whitespace characters.
