Correctness: **False**

The program only removes spaces (' ') from the string, but it fails to account for other types of whitespace characters. For example, it does not remove tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or other whitespace characters like those defined in Unicode. 

An example where the program does not work as expected is:
```python
input_str = "Hello,\tWorld!\n"
print(func_1(input_str))  # This would output "Hello,World!" instead of "Hello,World!"
```
In the expected output, all whitespace should be removed, not just spaces. Since the program does not handle all potential whitespace characters, its correctness is **False**.
