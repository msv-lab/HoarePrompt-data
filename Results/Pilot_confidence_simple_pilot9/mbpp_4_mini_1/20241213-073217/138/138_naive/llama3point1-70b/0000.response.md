Correctness: **True**. 

The provided program correctly identifies whether an element is present in the array and also returns the index of that element. The function uses the `index()` method to find the position of the element, and if the element is not found, it raises a `ValueError`, which is appropriately handled by the `try-except` block. The function returns a tuple with the expected boolean value and index. Since it correctly fulfills the problem requirements for all potential cases, the program is considered correct.
