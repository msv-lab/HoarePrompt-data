Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' within a given string. 

- The function `func_1` uses Python's built-in method `.count()`, which accurately counts non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring in the string.
- The assertions test various scenarios, including:
  - A string containing multiple non-overlapping 'std' occurrences (`'letstdlenstdporstd'` results in 3).
  - A string with a single occurrence of 'std' (`'truststdsolensporsd'` results in 1).
  - A string with two occurrences of 'std' (`'makestdsostdworthit'` results in 2).
  - A string that is exactly 'std' (`'stds'` results in 1).
  - An empty string (`''` results in 0).

All tested cases comply with the problem description, and no edge cases were found where the program would fail to produce the correct count of 'std'. Therefore, the implementation is correct.
