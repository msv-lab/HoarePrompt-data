Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where there are multiple occurrences of the substring within the main string. For example, if the main string is 'python python python', and the substring is 'python', the function will only find the first occurrence and return its position. However, the problem description implies that all occurrences and their positions should be returned or handled appropriately. As the function stands, it does not meet the requirement to find all occurrences, thus it is incomplete.
