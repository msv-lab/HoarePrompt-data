Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the substring occurs multiple times within the string. According to the problem description, it should return the occurrence and all positions of the substring. However, the current implementation only finds the first occurrence and does not return information for any subsequent occurrences. 

For example, if the input string is "ababc" and the substring is "ab", the expected behavior would be to find its first position (0) and allow for the possibility of finding subsequent occurrences, but the function only returns the first occurrence, and ignores others. This indicates that the logic for handling multiple occurrences is missing, which violates the requirements of the problem description.
