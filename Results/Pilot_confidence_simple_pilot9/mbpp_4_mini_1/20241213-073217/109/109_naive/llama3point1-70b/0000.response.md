Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to correctly handle the situation when `list1` is empty. According to the problem description, if `list1` is empty, it should have assigned `list2` to `list1`. However, the line `list1 = list2` merely creates a local reference and does not modify the original `list1` that was passed in. As a result, the function does not actually update the original `list1` when it is empty.

For example, if we have:
```python
list1 = []
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
result = func_1(list1, list2)
```
`result` would still be `[]`, while we would expect it to be `[1, 2, 3]`.

Thus, this edge case shows that the logic is incorrect.
