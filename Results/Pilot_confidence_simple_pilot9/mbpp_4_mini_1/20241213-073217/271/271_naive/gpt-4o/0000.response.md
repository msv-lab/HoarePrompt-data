To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list of averages for each index of the inner tuples.

### Provided Program
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        averages.append(avg)
    return averages
```

### Analysis
1. **Calculating Number of Elements**: 
   - The program starts by calculating `num_elements` from the first tuple. However, it does not check if the tuples are of the same length. If they aren't, this will lead to an `IndexError`.
  
2. **Index Access**: 
   - Within the main loop, it accesses `t[i]` assuming all tuples have at least `num_elements` elements, which may not be true.

3. **Average Calculation**:
   - It calculates the average correctly for provided examples, but without validating that all inner tuples are of the same length, it may incorrectly compute results or throw an error.

### Missing Cases
- If the program is given a tuple containing tuples of varying lengths, such as:
  ```python
  func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))
  ```
  The program will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access `t[i]` where `i` exceeds the number of elements in the shorter tuple.

### Conclusion
The program fails to handle cases where inner tuples can have different lengths, leading to potential exceptions or incorrect behavior.

Correctness: **False**.
