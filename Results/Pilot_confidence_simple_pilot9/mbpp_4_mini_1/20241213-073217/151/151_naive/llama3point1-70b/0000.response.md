Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It recursively traverses through the elements of the input `nested_list`, checking if each element is a list. If it is, the function calls itself to flatten that sublist and extends the `flat_list` with the flattened elements. If the element is not a list, it directly appends that element to `flat_list`.

The function handles various potential cases, such as:
- Flattening an empty list (`[]` returns `[]`).
- Flattening a list with integers only (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` returns `[1, 2, 3]`).
- Flattening a deeply nested list (e.g., `[1, [2, [3, 4]], 5]` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).

Given that the function can handle all types of nested structures and does not exhibit any logic errors for the stated problem, it is deemed correct.
