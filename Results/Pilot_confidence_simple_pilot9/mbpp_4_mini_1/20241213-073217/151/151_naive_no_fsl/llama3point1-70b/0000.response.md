Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to flatten a nested list structure. It utilizes recursion to handle lists within lists, and it adds non-list elements to the `flat_list`. The function should work for any case of nested lists, including various depths of nesting and different types of elements. 

For example, given the input `[[1, 2], [3, [4, 5], 6], 7]`, the function returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, flattening the nested structure as expected. There are no edge cases where the function would fail, such as handling empty lists or different data types, since it checks the type of each element before determining whether to flatten further or append it. 

Thus, there are no potential cases where the provided program does not adhere to the problem description, validating its correctness.
