To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the `func_1(s)` implementation given the requirements.

### Problem Description
The task is to check if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and the end of the word.

### Provided Program
```python
def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:  # Check if 'z' exists in the substring excluding the first and last character
        return True
    return False
```

### Analysis of the Code
1. The function checks for the presence of 'z' in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which correctly excludes the first and the last character of the string.
2. If 'z' is found in that substring, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Testing the Examples
The provided assertions are:
- `func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: The string `pythonzabc.` contains 'z' at index 6, which is not at the start (index 0) or end (index 11). This is correct.
- `func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: The string `zxyabc.` contains 'z' at the start (index 0). The assertion is correct as per the problem description.
- `func_1('  lang  .') == False`: There is no 'z' in the provided string, which is also correct as per the requirement.

### Edge Cases
- An empty string `func_1('')` should return `False` because there are no characters, hence no 'z' in any position.
- A string with just one character, e.g., `func_1('z')`, should return `False`, as 'z' is at the start and cannot qualify.
- A string with two characters like `func_1('az')` or `func_1('za')` should return `False`, as 'z' is either at the start or end.
- A string with 'z' at the second position, like `func_1('azb')`, should return `True`, confirming that 'z' is found between the first and last character.

### Conclusion
Since all the analyzed cases, including edge cases, align with the problem requirements, the program correctly identifies the presence of 'z' according to the stated conditions.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly returns `True` only if 'z' appears in the string but is not the first or last character, consistent with the problem description.
