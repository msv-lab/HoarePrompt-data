Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle cases where the string is very short. Specifically, if the string has a length of 1 or 2, then the slicing `s[1:-1]` will produce an empty string, which leads to a situation where 'z' will not be detected even if it is the only character in the string (for example, the string 'z' should return `False` because it appears at the start and end).

Here are the problematic cases:
- For `func_1('z')`, it will return `False`, but according to the problem description, since 'z' appears at the start, it should not be counted as present in the string.
- For `func_1('za')`, it will also return `False`, which is correct, but the presence of a `z` should not be missed if it resides in the middle of longer strings (e.g., `func_1('aaz')` would return `False` though it should yield `True`).

Hence, the logic fails for edge cases related to extremely short strings, making the overall validation incorrect.
