Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. For example, if we call `func_2(2)`, we expect it to return the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is 11. However, the program will return 13 instead because it only checks if numbers are prime and fall into the category of mod 6 being 1 or 5. 

A specific case to illustrate the problem would be when checking for the 4th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which should be 19. However, the logic in `func_2` fails to correctly identify and count these primes in the appropriate order because the algorithm continues to check integers greater than 7 and may not identify the correct nth number due to skipping primes that should have been counted.

Therefore, since it fails to produce the correct nth prime in some cases, the program is incorrect.
