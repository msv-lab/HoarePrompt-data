Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, but it does not implement the logic to generate prime numbers correctly. It returns a modified Fibonacci-like sequence instead of correctly identifying the nth prime number. 

For example, for `func_1(3)`, it returns `7`, which is the expected output, but for `func_1(4)`, the expected output should be `17`, which is indeed correct as per the assert provided; however, the logic of generating these "primes" is not accurate or complete according to the prime number generation logic. 

The logic should involve checking for prime status instead of just calculating values that appear to follow a sequence. This discrepancy shows a misalignment with the problem description which mandates the identification of prime numbers. 

Therefore, the function's results do not uphold the complete properties of prime number generation.
