Correctness: **False**

The provided program aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but it fails to correctly identify and return the required prime numbers, specifically due to the following issues:

1. The prime number generation method (`func_1`) only checks for primality but does not ensure that the numbers generated conform to the definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The requirement for a prime to be a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is stricter, as it must be in the form of \(6k \pm 1\) (which is loosely checked, but not comprehensively linked to the required sequence).

2. The sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes does not simply start from 7 and increment by 1 to find the next prime; instead, they must be derived from specific properties related to previous primes, including 3, 5, 7, and others. The current implementation risks wrongly categorizing some numbers as the nth prime of the desired type simply by checking if they are prime and satisfy the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`.

3. The program does not handle large `n` correctly; for higher values, it may take impractically long to identify the correct prime. Since finding nth primes can involve generating multiple candidates and verifying against complex sequences, the logic can misfire for larger inputs.

For example: if we ask for the 4th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, according to the known sequence, it should return 31 (the correct sequence being: 7, 11, 13, 19, 23, 31, 37...), but the function may return a number that is prime and of the form \(6k \pm 1\) without ensuring it is in the appropriate order of sequence.

Thus, since it fails to deliver the exact nth element in the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, the correctness of the implementation is flawed.
