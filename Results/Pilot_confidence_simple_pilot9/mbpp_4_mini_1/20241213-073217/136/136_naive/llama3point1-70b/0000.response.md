Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly takes a dictionary and an integer n as input, and it filters the dictionary to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to n. The implementation uses a dictionary comprehension, which is an efficient and readable way to achieve the required functionality. 

For example:
- Given the input `d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}` and `n = 2`, the function would return `{'b': 2, 'c': 3}`.
- If `n = 4`, it would return `{}` as there are no values greater than or equal to 4.

Since I cannot think of any edge cases where the function does not meet the problem's requirements and it handles various input cases correctly, the code is deemed correct.
