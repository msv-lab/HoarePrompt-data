Correctness: **False**

The program contains logical errors resulting in incorrect behavior. Specifically, the function `find_max_index` references `arr`, but `arr` is not defined in its scope. This will lead to a `NameError` when calling `func_1`. 

Additionally, the `flip` function operates on an undefined `arr`, which further indicates that the sorting logic is incomplete and flawed.

For example, if the input list is `[3, 1, 2]`, the program will fail to execute correctly and result in an error due to the undefined variable `arr`.

Thus, the program cannot be considered correct as it encounters errors due to scope issues, and it does not provide a valid sorting implementation.
