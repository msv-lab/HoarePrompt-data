Correctness: **False**.

The program incorrectly calls `func_1` before it is defined, which will lead to a `NameError` for any invocation of `func_1` before its definition. This means that, contrary to the problem description, the program will not be able to convert degrees to radians as expected. For instance, if you run the assertions provided at the beginning (`assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966`), it will raise an error since `func_1` hasn't been defined at that point in the code. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as it stands.
