Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to return the ASCII value of a single character. However, it does not enforce that the input is indeed a single character. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the input is an empty string or a string with more than one character.

For example, if `func_1("")` is called, it returns the ASCII value of an empty string, which will lead to an error since `ord` expects a single character and using `ord` on an empty string will raise a `TypeError`. Similarly, `func_1("ab")` would throw a `TypeError` as well.

Thus, the program does not handle the edge cases of invalid input correctly, resulting in incorrect behavior for those cases.
