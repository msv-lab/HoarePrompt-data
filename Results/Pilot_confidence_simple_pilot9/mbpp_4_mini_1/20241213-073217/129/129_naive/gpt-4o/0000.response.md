Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a character using the `ord` function in Python. It handles all characters that can be passed as input, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols, as all characters have a defined ASCII value. 

The test cases provided (for 'A', 'R', and 'S') are valid and demonstrate that the function produces the expected outputs. Since there are no edge cases or inputs that the function fails to handle based on the problem description, the implementation is correct.
