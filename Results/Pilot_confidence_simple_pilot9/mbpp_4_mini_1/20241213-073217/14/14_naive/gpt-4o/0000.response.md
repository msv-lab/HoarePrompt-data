Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a given array contains any duplicate elements. It achieves this by using a set to track previously seen numbers. As the function iterates through the array, it checks if the current number is already in the set. If it is found in the set, the function returns `True`, indicating a duplicate. If the function completes the loop without finding any duplicates, it correctly returns `False`. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, and all return the expected results (e.g., no duplicates, duplicates at different positions). Since there are no edge cases missed and the logic works for any input array, the program is correct.
