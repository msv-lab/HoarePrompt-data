To determine the correctness of the provided program in finding the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates triangular numbers. Triangular numbers are defined as the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, given by the formula \( T(k) = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \). The program is supposed to return the index `k` of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits.

### Analysis of the program:
1. The program starts with `k = 1` and enters an infinite loop (`while True`).
2. It calculates the triangular number using the formula and checks the length of the string conversion of the triangular number to determine if it has `n` digits.
3. If it finds a triangular number with `n` digits, it returns the value of `k`.
4. If not, it increments `k` and continues the search.

### Testing for correctness:
Let's consider the inputs according to the description and analyze edge cases:

- For `n = 1`: The smallest triangular number is 1 (T(1) = 1) which has 1 digit. Hence, it should return `1`.
- For `n = 2`: The smallest triangular number that has 2 digits is `10` (T(4) = 10). The function correctly returns `4`.
- For `n = 3`: The smallest triangular number with 3 digits is `105` (T(14) = 105). The function correctly returns `14`.
- For `n = 4`: The smallest triangular number with 4 digits is `1001` (T(45) = 1035). The function correctly returns `45`.

However, the current implementation does not cover the edge case where an input is `0` or where the number of digits is `n` that doesn't yield an existing triangular number.

If for `n = 5`, the smallest triangular number is `1001`, hence it needs to check the cases up to `T(50)` which gives us the appropriate ranges but does not enforce boundaries nor check for negative or zero digit requests.

### Edge Case:
When `n = 0`, based on the implementation:
- The program would lead to an infinite loop trying to find a triangular number with zero digits as it will never consider returning anything, resulting in an infinite computation.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to properly handle the case where `n = 0`, and it could also have issues handling negative numbers or malformed inputs.

Correctness: **False**. The potential case where `n = 0` or any negative integers leads the function to enter an infinite loop without returning any result, which is against the expected behavior described.
