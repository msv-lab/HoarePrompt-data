Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst, element)` correctly checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. It iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` if any item is not equal to the `element`. If it completes the loop without finding any unequal items, it returns `True`. 

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for the tested cases:
- In the first case, not all colors are 'blue', thus returning `False`.
- In the second case, the numbers do not all match '7', so it correctly returns `False`.
- In the third case, all items are 'green', hence the function returns `True`. 

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the given problem description, confirming its correctness.
