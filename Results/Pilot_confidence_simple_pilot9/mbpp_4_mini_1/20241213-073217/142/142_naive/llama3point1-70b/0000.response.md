Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all the items in the provided list `lst` are equal to the specified `element`. It uses the built-in `all()` function along with a generator expression that evaluates `item == element` for each item in the list. 

This implementation accounts for all potential cases:
1. If the list is empty, `all()` returns `True` since there are no items that violate the condition.
2. For non-empty lists, it checks each item against the given `element`. If all are equal, it returns `True`; if any item is different, it returns `False`.

This aligns perfectly with the problem description, and no edge cases appear to be overlooked. Thus, the program is correct for all potential inputs.
