Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(lst, element)` correctly checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. It uses the built-in function `all()` combined with a generator expression to iterate through each item in the list. The expression `item == element` returns `True` if all items match the `element`, and `all()` returns `True` only if all items evaluated to `True`.

Here are the potential edge cases:

1. **Empty List**: If `lst` is empty, `all()` returns `True`, which is consistent with the notion that all elements in an empty set satisfy any condition.
2. **Single Element List**: If `lst` contains a single element, it correctly checks against the `element` and will return `True` if it matches.
3. **All Equal Elements**: If all elements in the list are equal to `element`, it returns `True`.
4. **Mixed Elements**: If any element is not equal to `element`, it correctly returns `False`.

Since the function handles all these scenarios appropriately and meets the problem description requirements fully, it is correct.
