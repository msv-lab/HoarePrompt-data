Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, it's unclear what should happen if the input list is empty. The function `func_1` will return `True` if the list is empty and the `element` is provided, which may not be the intended behavior based on a reasonable interpretation of the problem description that likely implies an empty list shouldn't match a non-empty element.

For example:
- `func_1([], 'blue')` will return `True`, which suggests that "all items (which do not exist) are equal to 'blue'" â€” a situation that could be interpreted as incorrect based on the requirement that all items should equal the given element. 

Thus, since this edge case is not handled in accordance with typical expectations (likely to return `False`), the program does not meet the correctness criteria as per the problem description.
