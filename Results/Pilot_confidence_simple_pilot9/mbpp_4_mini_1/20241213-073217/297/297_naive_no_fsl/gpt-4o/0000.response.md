Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case when the input tuple contains only one element correctly. According to the problem description, the function should return a tuple of length \( N \), where \( N \) is the length of the input tuple minus one. However, in the implementation of `func_1`, if the input tuple has only one element (like `(12,)`), the function returns an empty tuple `()`, which is not consistent with the problem description.

For example, in this case:
```python
assert func_1((12,)) == ()
```
This assertion is expected to fail because:
- The input tuple has 1 element, which should imply that the output tuple has a length of \( 1 - 1 = 0 \), leading to an empty tuple. But according to the requirements, there should be no output since it does not meet the criteria of multiplying consecutive elements.

This creates a mismatch between how the program operates and what the problem description states. The program only works correctly for tuples with two or more elements, not for the edge case of a single-element tuple or for the situation where the input tuple is empty. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.
