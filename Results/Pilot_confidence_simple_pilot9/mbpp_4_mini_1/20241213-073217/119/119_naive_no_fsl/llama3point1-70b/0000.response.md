Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(a, b)` takes in two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The requirements specify that the function should return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, and the implementation adheres to this. 

For example:

- If `a = 1` and `b = 2`, the function returns `(2, 1)`.
- If `a = -1` and `b = 3`, the function returns `(3, -1)`.
- If `a = 0` and `b = 5`, the function returns `(5, 0)`.
- Strings, floats, or other data types can also be passed, and it will still return a tuple in the correct order.

Since there are no edge cases or types of inputs that break the requirements, the program works as intended for all potential inputs.
