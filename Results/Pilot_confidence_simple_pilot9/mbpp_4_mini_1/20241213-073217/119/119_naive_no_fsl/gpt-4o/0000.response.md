Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the problem description, which states that it should take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. 

The provided assertions confirm this behavior:

- `func_1(10, 20)` correctly returns `(20, 10)`.
- `func_1(15, 17)` correctly returns `(17, 15)`.
- `func_1(100, 200)` correctly returns `(200, 100)`.

Since all cases tested and the logic of the function align perfectly with the requirements stated in the problem description, the function has been verified to work correctly for the provided inputs, and there are no edge cases that the code fails to address. Therefore, the program is correct.
