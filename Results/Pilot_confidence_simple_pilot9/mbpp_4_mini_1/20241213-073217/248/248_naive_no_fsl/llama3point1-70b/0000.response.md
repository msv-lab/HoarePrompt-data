Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts a list to a tuple, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. The function utilizes the built-in `tuple()` function, which accepts a list and returns a tuple containing the same elements as the list. This behavior is consistent for all possible list inputs, including empty lists, lists of various data types, and nested lists. 

For example:
- Input: `[]` (empty list) → Output: `()` (empty tuple)
- Input: `[1, 2, 3]` → Output: `(1, 2, 3)`
- Input: `['a', 'b', 'c']` → Output: `('a', 'b', 'c')`
- Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` → Output: `([1, 2], [3, 4])`

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and conforms to the problem description without any missing logic or edge cases, it is deemed correct.
