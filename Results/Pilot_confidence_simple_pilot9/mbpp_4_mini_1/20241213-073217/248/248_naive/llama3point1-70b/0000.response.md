Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function. It will handle all potential cases, including:

- An empty list, which will convert to an empty tuple `()`.
- A list with a single element, which will convert to a tuple with that single element.
- A list with multiple elements, which will correctly form a tuple with the same elements in the same order.

Since the function adheres to the problem description for all potential inputs and correctly converts a list to a tuple, I conclude that the correctness is valid in every case.
