Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1(nums)` correctly utilizes Python's built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in the provided list `nums`. The `min()` function is designed to handle various cases, including lists with negative numbers, multiple instances of the smallest number, and edge cases like a list with a single element. Therefore, it works correctly for all potential inputs based on the given problem description.
