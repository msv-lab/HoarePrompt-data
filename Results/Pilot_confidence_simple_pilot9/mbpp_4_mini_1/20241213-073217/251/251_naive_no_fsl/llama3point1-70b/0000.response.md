Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates. It calculates the radius \( r \) using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which correctly computes the distance from the origin to the point \((x, y)\), and calculates the angle \( \phi \) using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which gives the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point \((x, y)\). The use of `math.atan2` also handles the correct quadrant for the angle, which is critical for comprehensive conversion.

All examples of rectangular coordinates such as \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), and \((-1, -1)\) will yield the correct polar coordinates based on the mathematical definitions. The implementation works correctly for all potential cases without any missing logic or edge cases that are not handled. Hence, the program is correct.
