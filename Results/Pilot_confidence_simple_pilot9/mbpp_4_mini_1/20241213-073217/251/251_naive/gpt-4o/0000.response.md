Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Î¸). 

1. The calculation for `r` uses the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is correct for obtaining the radial distance from the origin.
2. The calculation for `theta` uses `math.atan2(y, x)`, which is the appropriate function for calculating the angle in polar coordinates, taking into account the correct quadrant based on the signs of x and y.

Additionally, the assertions provided check the function against valid inputs and confirm that the outputs are as expected for those inputs. Since the implementation adheres to the problem description and accurately handles the conversion, I found no edge cases where it fails.
