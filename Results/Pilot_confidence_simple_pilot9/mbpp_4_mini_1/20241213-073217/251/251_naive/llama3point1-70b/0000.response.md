Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the definitions of the polar coordinate system. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of how it works:

- The function `math.hypot(x, y)` computes the radius \( r \) as the distance from the origin (0,0) to the point (x,y), which is accurate for all inputs.
- The function `math.atan2(y, x)` computes the angle \( \phi \) in radians, taking into account the signs of both x and y, which ensures that the angle is determined correctly in all four quadrants.

The program handles all possible cases for rectangular coordinates, including:
1. Points in all quadrants of the Cartesian plane.
2. The origin (0, 0), where the radius \( r \) will be 0 and the angle is typically undefined but can conventionally be set to 0.
3. Negative values for \( x \) and/or \( y \).

Since it accurately handles the conversion for all potential scenarios, the program is correct.
