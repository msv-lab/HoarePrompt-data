To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

The problem description states that the function should check whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). 

Now, let's look at the provided program:

```python
def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
```

The function `func_1` checks if the input `month` is in the set `{4, 6, 9, 11}`. This is a correct implementation based on the problem description, as it accurately identifies which months have 30 days.

The assertions:
```python
assert func_1(6) == True  # June has 30 days
assert func_1(2) == False # February does not have 30 days
assert func_1(12) == False # December does not have 30 days
```
are consistent with the logic of the function and further validate its correctness against specific inputs.

However, we need to think of potential edge cases that might not have been explicitly tested. The function does not handle:

1. Input less than 1 or greater than 12: If the input month is outside the 1-12 range, the function should ideally return `False` because those numbers do not correspond to a valid month.

Examples:
- `func_1(0)` should return `False` (0 is not a valid month).
- `func_1(13)` should return `False` (13 is not a valid month).

Considering these edge cases, the function does not handle all potential inputs as per the problem description since it doesn't account for invalid month numbers.

Correctness: **False**. 

This conclusion is reached because the function does not correctly handle inputs outside the valid month range (1-12).
