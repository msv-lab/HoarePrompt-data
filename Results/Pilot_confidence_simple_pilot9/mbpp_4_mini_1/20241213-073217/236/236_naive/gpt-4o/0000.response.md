Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether the specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element greater than the one that follows, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it completes the iteration without finding such a pair, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

The assertions provided test the function against various scenarios, including a completely sorted list, a list with one element out of order, and a list that starts and ends with elements out of order. The function works correctly for all these cases, confirming its correctness based on the problem description.
