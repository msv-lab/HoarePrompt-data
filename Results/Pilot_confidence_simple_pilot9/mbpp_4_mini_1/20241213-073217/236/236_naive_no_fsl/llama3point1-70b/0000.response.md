Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted by comparing the original list `nums` to its sorted version `sorted(nums)`. If they are equal, it means the list is sorted in ascending order. 

I have considered various potential edge cases:
1. An empty list: `[]` is considered sorted.
2. A single-element list: `[1]`, which is also trivially sorted.
3. A list with duplicate elements: `[2, 2, 3, 3, 4]` is sorted.
4. A list that is not sorted: `[3, 2, 1]` correctly returns `False`.

Since the function works correctly for these and other possible cases without failing to meet the problem's requirements, the function's logic is sound and comprehensive. Thus, I conclude that the code is correct.
