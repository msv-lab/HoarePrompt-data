Correctness: **False**. 

The program incorrectly removes lowercase substrings from the string by only retaining uppercase characters. However, the requirement is to remove all lowercase substrings, which implies that uppercase characters and non-alphabetic characters should remain unchanged. For example, the input string "HelloWorld" would return "HW" in the current implementation, which is not removing the lowercase substrings as required. A better implementation would be to filter out the lowercase letters entirely, keeping both uppercase and non-alphabetic characters intact.
