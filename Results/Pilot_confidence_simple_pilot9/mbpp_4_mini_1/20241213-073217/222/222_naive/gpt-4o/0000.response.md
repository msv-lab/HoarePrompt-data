Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` is designed to remove lowercase substrings from the given string `s`, by keeping only the uppercase characters. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works correctly for the examples given. 

1. In the case of `func_1('PYTHon')`, the expected output is `'PYTH'`, which matches the assertion.
2. For `func_1('FInD')`, the output is `'FID'`, aligning with the assertion.
3. Lastly, `func_1('STRinG')` yields `'STRG'`, consistent with the assertion.

The program iterates through each character of the string and retains only those that are uppercase, effectively removing all lowercase characters as required. Since I cannot think of any potential cases that the program does not handle correctly, I conclude that the implementation meets the stated problem description.
