Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the function `func_1` only collects uppercase characters from the input string and concatenates them, thereby failing to remove any lowercase substrings. 

For example, if the input string is `"HelloWorld"`, the expected outcome according to the problem description would be to remove lowercase parts, resulting in `"HW"`. However, the program will return `"HW"` as expected, but it fails to address the point that it does not "remove" lowercase substrings from the string because it's only collecting uppercase letters without handling the lowercase parts properly.

A more direct issue arises in cases where only lowercase letters exist in the input. If we consider an input like `"abc"`, the program will return an empty string `""`, which contradicts the expected behavior of "removing" lowercase substrings. 

Thus, the program doesn't fulfill the task as given in the problem description.
