To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program carefully.

### Problem Description:
The function should return the list from a list of lists where the sum of its elements is the highest.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
```

### Analysis:
1. The function uses `max(lists, key=sum)`, which is a Python built-in function that will return the item from `lists` with the maximum value when using `sum` as a criterion.
2. It assumes that `lists` is a list containing other lists (sub-lists) as elements.

### Considerations:
- If `lists` is empty, the program will raise a `ValueError` since `max()` is not defined for an empty iterable.
- If `lists` contains empty sublists, `max()` will still return one of them, as they all have a sum of 0.

### Test Cases:
- If we call `func_1([])`, it will raise an error.
- If we call `func_1([[1, 2], [3], []])`, it will return `[1, 2]` or `[3]` depending on implementation, which works as expected since the sum of `[3]` is greater than that of `[1, 2]` and `[]`.

### Conclusion:
The primary issue with the code is its behavior when the input list is empty, as it does not handle this case gracefully.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case when `lists` is empty, leading to a potential runtime error.
