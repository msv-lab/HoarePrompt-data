To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to assess if it properly identifies the list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest according to the problem description.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list
```

### Problem description:
- Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_sum` is initialized to negative infinity, which allows for any possible sum of lists to be greater than this initial value.
   - `max_list` starts as an empty list.

2. **Loop through each sublist**:
   - The function iterates over `list_of_lists`.
   - For each sublist, it calculates the sum.
   - If the current sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist.

3. **Return the result**:
   - After evaluating all sublists, `max_list` is returned, which is the sublist with the highest sum.

### Potential Cases:
- The program assumes that there is at least one non-empty sublist in the input. If an empty list is provided (e.g. `func_1([])` or `func_1([[]])`), the function will return an empty list which may not be aligned with a logical expectation based on potential input (another case could be `func_1([[1], [], [2]])`, which would return `[1]`, not taking into account that it could also include empty sublists).

### Test Cases:
1. `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]])` returns `[10, 11, 12]` (correct).
2. `func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]])` returns `[12, 11, 10]` (correct).
3. `func_1([[2, 3, 1]])` returns `[2, 3, 1]` (correct).
4. `func_1([])` returns `[]` (might not be the intended behavior).
5. `func_1([[1], []])` returns `[1]` (ignores empty sublist).

The above indicates that the function does not handle the case of all empty lists correctly and does not return a list in case of an empty input.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases, specifically when provided with empty lists or lists containing only empty lists. 

Correctness: **False**.
