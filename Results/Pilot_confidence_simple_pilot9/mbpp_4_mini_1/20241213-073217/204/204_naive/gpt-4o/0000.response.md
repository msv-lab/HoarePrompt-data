Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly identifies whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It accurately checks against the set of months with 31 days, which are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

The assertions provided check various month numbers:
- For May (5), it correctly returns True.
- For February (2), it returns False, which is correct as February has 28 or 29 days typically.
- For June (6), it also returns False, which is accurate.
- For January (1), it returns True, which is correct.
- For December (12), it returns True, which is correct.
- For November (11), it returns False, which is also correct.

Given that the function checks against the right set and the assertions validate the implementation, I find no potential cases where it does not meet the problem's requirements.
