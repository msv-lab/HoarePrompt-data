Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number (1 through 12) contains 31 days. The set `months_with_31_days` accurately represents the months that have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

All cases tested with assertions match the expected outputs:
- For May (5), it returns `True` (31 days).
- For February (2), it returns `False` (28 or 29 days depending on the year).
- For June (6), it returns `False` (30 days).
- For January (1), it returns `True` (31 days).
- For December (12), it returns `True` (31 days).
- For November (11), it returns `False` (30 days).

Since the function correctly identifies whether a month has 31 days for all valid months (1 to 12), it meets the problem description requirements thoroughly, thereby verifying its correctness.
