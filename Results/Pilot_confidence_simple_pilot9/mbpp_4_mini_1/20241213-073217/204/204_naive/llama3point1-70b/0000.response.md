Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly identifies whether a given month number contains 31 days. It checks if the input number `n` (which represents the month) is in the predefined list `months_31_days` that contains month numbers with 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

The function returns `True` for valid inputs (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) that have 31 days. For all other month numbers (2 for February and 4, 6, 9, 11 for months that do not have 31 days), it returns `False`. It handles all valid month numbers (1 to 12) correctly based on the given problem description. There are no potential cases where it fails to meet the requirements.
