Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible month numbers. Specifically, it fails to address the case of invalid month numbers (e.g., 0, 13, or negative numbers). The function should return a value indicating whether a given month number is valid and whether it has 31 days.

For example:
- `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` should not be valid inputs, but the current implementation does not handle these cases, leading to unexpected behavior.

Thus, since there can be inputs (like 0 or 13) for which the function does not behave correctly, the correctness verdict is False.
