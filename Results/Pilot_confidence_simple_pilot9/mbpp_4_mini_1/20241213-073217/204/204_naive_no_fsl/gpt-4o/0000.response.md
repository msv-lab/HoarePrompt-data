Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle invalid month numbers properly. According to the problem description, the function should check whether a given month number contains 31 days. However, it does not account for months outside the standard range of 1 to 12, which represent valid months. 

For example, if we call `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)`, the function will incorrectly return `False` since these month numbers do not exist in the defined set of months with 31 days. Thus, the function should ideally return an error or handle such cases more appropriately, indicating that the month number is invalid.

This oversight means that the program does not operate correctly for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is false.
