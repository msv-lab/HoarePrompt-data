Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not correctly handle all edge cases, specifically when handling negative numbers. For example, the list `[-2, -1, 0, 1]` contains consecutive numbers in terms of their natural ordering, but the implementation will return `False` because the negative numbers will not be considered as consecutive with the positive numbers when sorted. 

Another test case, such as `[3, 5, 4]`, would incorrectly return `True` because the function sorts the list and evaluates it; however, the numbers 3, 4, and 5 are indeed consecutive.

Hence, the function fails to return the expected result for certain valid scenarios.
