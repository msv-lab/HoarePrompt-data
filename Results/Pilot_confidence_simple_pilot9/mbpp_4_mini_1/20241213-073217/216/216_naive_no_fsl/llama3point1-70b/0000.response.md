To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The task is to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Sorting the List**: The program first sorts the input list (`lst.sort()`).
2. **Checking Consecutiveness**: It then uses a generator expression to check if each element is exactly one greater than the previous element (i.e., `lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1` for all indices).
3. **Uniqueness Check**: It ensures that the list has no duplicate elements by checking `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`.

### Potential Cases:
Let’s analyze the function with various potential input cases:

1. **Example 1**: Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Checks: 2-1=1, 3-2=1, 4-3=1 → **True**

2. **Example 2**: Input: `[3, 2, 1, 4]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Checks: 2-1=1, 3-2=1, 4-3=1 → **True**

3. **Example 3**: Input: `[1, 2, 4]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 4]`
   - Checks: 2-1=1, 4-2=2 → **False**

4. **Example 4**: Input: `[1, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Checks: 1-1=0, 2-1=1, 3-2=1 → **False** (it fails the uniqueness check)

5. **Example 5**: Input: `[]` (Empty list)
   - Since there are no numbers, the sorted list is also empty.
   - The check will say `True` because `all()` on an empty iterable returns `True`.
   - However, an empty list should not contain consecutive numbers, which should fail.

Based on the examination of the above test cases, we have identified an edge case:

- **Edge Case**: An empty list should return `False` because there are no numbers to be consecutive.

### Conclusion:
The function fails to correctly handle the empty list scenario according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program:

Correctness: **False**
