Correctness: **False**. 

There is a potential case where the program does not handle tuples of different lengths. For example, if you input `func_1((1, 2), (1, 2, 3))`, the program will raise a `ValueError` when trying to zip the tuples since the lengths differ. The problem description implies the function should operate on two tuples of the same length, but the implementation does not check or enforce this, making it incorrect.
