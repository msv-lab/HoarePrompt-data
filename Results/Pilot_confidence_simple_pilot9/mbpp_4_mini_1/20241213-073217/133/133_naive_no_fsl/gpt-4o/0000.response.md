Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples as input and correctly subtracts corresponding elements from the first tuple by those from the second tuple using a generator expression within the `tuple()` function.

I have analyzed the function and verified against the provided examples:

1. For the input `((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18))`, the output is `(8, -1, -13)`, which is correct.
2. For the input `((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16))`, the output is `(-13, -43, -13)`, which is also correct.
3. For the input `((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12))`, the output is `(-3, 7, -3)`, which is again correct.

I also considered edge cases:
- If one tuple is shorter than the other, `zip` will only consider elements that exist in both tuples, which is appropriate behavior since it avoids index errors and correctly reflects the operation intended.
- If tuples are empty, the return will be an empty tuple, which is correct.

Since I could not find any case where the function does not meet the specified requirements, I conclude that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
