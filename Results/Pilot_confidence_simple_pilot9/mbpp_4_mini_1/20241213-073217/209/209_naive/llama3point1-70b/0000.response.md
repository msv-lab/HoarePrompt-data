To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to consider edge cases. 

The problem asks for a function to get the first element of each sublist in a list of sublists. 

Here is the provided program:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

Potential edge cases to consider:
1. If a sublist is empty, trying to access `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`.
2. If the input `sublists` is empty, the function will return an empty list, which is correct but it does not handle the case of empty sublists.

Let's consider an example where the function gets called with a list containing empty sublists:

```python
func_1([[], [], []])  # This will raise an IndexError because it tries to access the first element of empty sublists.
```

Since there are cases where the program does not work as expected (i.e., it raises an error with empty sublists), we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
