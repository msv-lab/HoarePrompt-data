Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly splits a given list into two parts based on the integer L provided. Here's why the code works correctly for all potential cases:

1. If L is non-negative and less than or equal to the length of the list, the function captures the first L elements accurately and returns the remainder of the list.
2. If L exceeds the length of the list (L > len(lst)), the first part will simply return the entire list, and the second part will be an empty list, which is the expected behavior.
3. If L is zero, the function will return an empty list for the first part and the entire list for the second part, again as expected.
4. The function handles edge cases like an empty input list correctly by returning two empty lists.

In all cases, the function adheres to the problem statement's requirements, thus confirming its correctness.
