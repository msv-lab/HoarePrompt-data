Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as input and uses the built-in `count` method on the tuple to return the number of occurrences of the specified element. 

The `count` method works for all possible inputs, including:
- Tuples with multiple occurrences of the element.
- Tuples with no occurrences of the element.
- Tuples containing different data types, including strings, integers, and nested tuples.

Since the implementation adheres to the problem description and correctly handles all relevant cases without missing any logic, the program is correct.
