Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly filters odd numbers from the list of integers. The implementation uses a list comprehension to check each number in the input list `nums`, ensuring that only those numbers for which `num % 2 != 0` (indicating they are odd) are included in the resulting list. 

All the test cases provided confirm that the function behaves as expected:

1. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the output is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which are all the odd numbers in the list.
2. For the input `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`, the output is `[45, 67, 93]`, which again contains only the odd numbers.
3. For the input `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]`, the output is `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, confirming the inclusion of all odd numbers.

There are no edge cases or inputs that would lead the function to produce an incorrect result based on the problem description. Thus, I conclude that the code is correct.
