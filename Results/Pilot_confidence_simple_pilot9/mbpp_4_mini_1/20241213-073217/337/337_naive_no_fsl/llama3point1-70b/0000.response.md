To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the functionality of the `func_1` against the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function to find the **sum of non-repeated elements** in a given list.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is as follows:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
```

1. **Functionality**: The program uses a generator expression to iterate through each element `i` in the list `lst`. It includes `i` in the sum only if the count of `i` in the list is exactly one (`lst.count(i) == 1`).

2. **Repeated Elements**: The code assumes that if an element is repeated (count > 1), it is not included in the sum. This is aligned with the problem of summing only non-repeated elements.

### Edge Cases / Potential Issues:
- **Performance**: The use of `lst.count(i)` inside a loop makes the program inefficient for large lists because `lst.count(i)` itself performs a linear search each time, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2).
  
- **Correctness Check**: For edge cases:
    - If the input list is empty (`[]`), the output should be `0`, which is handled correctly.
    - For a list with all elements repeated, e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`, the output should also be `0`, which is also correctly handled.
    - For a list with non-repeated elements, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, the sum should be `6`, which is correctly handled by the code.
    - If a list contains multiple repeated elements, e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]`, the sum should be `1 + 4 = 5`, which is also handled correctly.

However, the issue arises when considering the use of `count()` which could lead to performance problems but not correctness issues in terms of outputs.

### Conclusion:
The function does return the correct results in all tested scenarios by correctly identifying non-repeated elements. Although the efficiency is questionable for larger inputs, the factual outputs are still correct as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly sums only the non-repeated elements in the given list according to the problem description.
