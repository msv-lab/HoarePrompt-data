Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly computes the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function, which efficiently iterates through the list and checks if each element appears exactly once using `lst.count(i) == 1`. 

Since the program checks all elements in the input list and sums only those that satisfy the non-repeated condition, it effectively adheres to the problem description. Examples of its operation can be validated:

- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the result will be `3` (since `3` is the only non-repeated number).
- For the input `[4, 5, 4, 6, 7, 6]`, the result will be `5 + 7 = 12` (where both `5` and `7` are non-repeated).
- For the input with all repeated elements, such as `[1, 1, 1]`, the result will be `0` since there are no non-repeated elements.

Since no edge cases or missing logic have been found that would cause the program to fail or deviate from the problem description, it is confirmed to be correct across all potential cases.
