Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to check whether all the characters in the input string are the same. However, it fails to handle the case of an empty string properly according to common expectations in programming.

The current implementation returns `True` when the input string is empty (`if not s: return True`). However, logically, it's often expected that a string without characters does not satisfy the condition "all characters are the same," leading to a conclusion that should return `False` instead in this context.

For example:
- `func_1('')` would return `True` according to the code, but the expected behavior for an empty string should be `False`.

Thus, there is at least one case (the empty string) where the program would not behave as most would reasonably expect for the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
