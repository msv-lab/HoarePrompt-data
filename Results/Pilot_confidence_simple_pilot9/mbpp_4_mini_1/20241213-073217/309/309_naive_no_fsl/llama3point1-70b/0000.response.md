Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string to a set (which removes duplicate characters) and then checking if the length of that set is equal to 1. If all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain exactly one unique character, leading to a length of 1. If the string contains different characters, the length of the set will be greater than 1.

The function behaves correctly across various cases:

1. For an empty string `""`, the function would return `True` since there are no characters to disagree upon.
2. For a string with a single character `"a"`, it returns `True` since there is only one unique character.
3. For a string with identical characters like `"aaaa"`, it returns `True`.
4. For strings with varying characters like `"abc"` or `"aaab"`, it correctly returns `False`.

There are no detected edge cases where the function would fail or return an incorrect value based on the problem description, thus confirming its correctness.
