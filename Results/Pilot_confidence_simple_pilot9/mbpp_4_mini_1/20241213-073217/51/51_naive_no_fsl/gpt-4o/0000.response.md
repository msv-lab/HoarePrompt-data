Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle an edge case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should multiply all numbers in the list and then divide by the length of the list. If the list is empty, the function will attempt to compute the length of an empty list, which will lead to a division by zero error. 

For example:
- If we call `func_1([])` (an empty list), it will result in a division by zero, which is not handled in the existing implementation. 

Since the program does not handle this case correctly, its correctness is deemed as false.
