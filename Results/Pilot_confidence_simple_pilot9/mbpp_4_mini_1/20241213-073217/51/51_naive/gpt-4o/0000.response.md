To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let’s examine the requirements and what the program does.

### Problem description:
The goal is to write a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and divides the product by the length of the list.

### Provided Program:
```python
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((-10, -20, -30)), -2000.0, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((19, 15, 18)), 1710.0, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
```

### Program Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` initializes a `product` variable to 1.
2. It then iterates over each number in `numbers`, multiplying each number into `product`.
3. Finally, it divides the `product` by the length of `numbers` and returns the result.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, then `len(numbers)` will be 0. This will result in a division by zero error, which has not been addressed in the code. 

  Example case:
  ```python
  func_1([])  # This would raise a ZeroDivisionError.
  ```

- **Single Element List**: While it may technically work because the product of one number divided by one is itself, it’s worth noting that it doesn't guarantee that the logic handles single elements as expected based on the problem description.

Given these potential issues, particularly the unhandled case of an empty input list, we can conclude that the program does not fulfill the problem requirements for all potential cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.
