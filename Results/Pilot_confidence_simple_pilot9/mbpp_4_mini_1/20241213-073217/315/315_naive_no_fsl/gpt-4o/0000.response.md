Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and correctly adds the elements of the tuple to the list by converting the tuple into a list using `list(tpl)` and then concatenating it to `lst` using the `+` operator. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given examples. This implementation will work for any tuple of any length, including an empty tuple, as the behavior defined by the program will seamlessly accommodate those cases. For example:

- If the tuple is empty (`func_1([1, 2], ())`), it correctly returns `[1, 2]`.

Hence, all potential cases have been considered, and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.
