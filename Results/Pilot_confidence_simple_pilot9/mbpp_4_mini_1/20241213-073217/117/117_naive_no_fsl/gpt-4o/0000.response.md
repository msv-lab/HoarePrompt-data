Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the provided list `lst`. It uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function, which iterates through each element `x` in `lst` and checks if `x` is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`. If the condition is true, it yields `1`, which contributes to the total sum.

The provided assertions also cover various scenarios:
- In the first case, `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]`, there are two integers: `1` and `2`, resulting in `2`.
- In the second case, `[1, 2, 3]`, all three elements are integers, resulting in `3`.
- In the third case, `[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]`, there are two integers: `1` and `4`, resulting in `2`.

The function handles the cases of mixed types correctly, confirming its ability to count only integer values. No edge cases are found that the code does not handle, so it operates as expected as per the problem description.
