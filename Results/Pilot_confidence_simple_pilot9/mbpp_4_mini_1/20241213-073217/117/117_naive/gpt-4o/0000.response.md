To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description:

**Problem Description:** Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3
assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2

def func_1(lst):
    return sum((1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)))
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1` iterates through the given list `lst`.
2. For each element in `lst`, it checks if the element is an instance of `int`.
3. It sums up the count of these integer instances.
4. The assertions provided are examples to check if the function returns the expected count of integer elements.

**Edge cases to consider:**
- If the input list is empty `[]`, the function should return `0` since there are no elements.
- If the list contains only non-integer types, such as strings or floats (e.g. `['abc', 1.2]`), the function should also return `0`.
- Mixing integer and float values (e.g. `[1, 2, 3.0]`) should still correctly count only the integers.

Now, validating the program against these cases:

- For `[]`, `func_1([])` should return `0`, and the current implementation does so.
- For `['abc', 1.2]`, `func_1(['abc', 1.2])` should return `0`, and it does.
- For `[1, 2, 3.0]`, `func_1([1, 2, 3.0])` should return `2`, which it does not produce a direct error for either. 

The function correctly counts integers based on the description and handles the cases provided in the assertions. There seems to be no edge case failing example that can be easily derived that contradicts the specification.

Thus, the function appears to work correctly for the provided description, examples, and edge cases examined.

Correctness: **True**.
