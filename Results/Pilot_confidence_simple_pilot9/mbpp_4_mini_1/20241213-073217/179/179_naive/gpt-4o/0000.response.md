Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` generates the first `n` even natural numbers and computes the sum of their cubes. Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Even Natural Numbers Generation**: It correctly generates even numbers using the expression `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`, which generates the sequence 2, 4, 6, ..., when `n` is 1, 2, 3, etc.

2. **Cubing the Even Numbers**: The use of `x ** 3` computes the cube of each even number as required.

3. **Summation**: The `sum()` function correctly aggregates all cubed values.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided test the function for inputs `2`, `3`, and `4`, all of which yield the expected results (72, 288, and 800 respectively). Each case correctly reflects the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

Since all test cases are valid and the logic adheres to the problem description without missing edge cases or conditions, the program is correct for every potential input described.
