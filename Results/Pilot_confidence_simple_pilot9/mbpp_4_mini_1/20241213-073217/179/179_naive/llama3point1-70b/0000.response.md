Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly computes the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the range of the first n even numbers (from 2 to 2*n) and sums their cubes. This implementation handles all valid inputs for n, including edge cases like n = 0 (where the sum would correctly return 0) and positive integers. Thus, the function behaves as expected for the problem statement.
