To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the code implementation.

**Problem description:** The problem asks for a function to check whether a given number is undulating or not. A number is considered undulating if it "oscillates" between increasing and decreasing at each digit. 

**Program Analysis:**
The function `func_1` converts the input number to a string and checks consecutive elements to see if they are undulating. The key condition checks whether the current digit (`n[i]`) is part of a strictly increasing or decreasing triplet with its neighbors.

**Identifying Potential Issues:**
1. It does not check the first and last digits. The loop starts from `1` and goes to `len(n) - 1`, which means that it ignores the first digit and the last digit's relationships with their neighbors. This could allow for cases where the number fails to be undulating but is not checked.
2. The definition of undulating is ambiguous in the code. It is not explicitly handling cases where there's no oscillation; for example, all digits are the same, which would not be undulating according to the standard interpretation.

**Counterexample:**
Consider the input `345`. 
- According to the implementation, it will check the three digits: 
  - For `3 < 4 < 5` it will pass the condition, thus marking it `undulating`.
- However, technically, the arrangement `345` does not oscillate between high and low values; it simply increases.
  
Another similar case can be tested:
- For a number like `222`, it would not work either since all digits are the same and it should not be undulating.

Given these points, the program doesn't handle the checks correctly for different conditions described above.

Correctness: **False**
