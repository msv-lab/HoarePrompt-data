To determine if the provided Python program meets the problem description, let's first analyze the requirements:

**Problem description**: The goal is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible.

Now, let's break down the provided program to see if it faithfully implements this functionality:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Empty List Check**: The program correctly handles an empty list by returning 0.
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of numbers. This is a good approach because by sorting the numbers, we can ensure that if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `nums[i]` will be greater than or equal to `nums[j]`, which may make it easier to build the divisible subset.
3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses a dynamic programming array (`dp`) to keep track of the largest size of divisible subsets ending at each element `i`.

### Potential Case Not Handled:
The program logic seems to work well for cases where elements can build a larger subset based on divisibility, but it may not correctly handle cases where a subset starts to form but isn't captured properly. For instance:

- **Sequence with Prime Numbers**: When input like `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]` is given, the expected output would be `1`, because no number is divisible by any other. However, due to the current logic, it will still return `1` since each number can be a subset of size 1, but it fails to consider that no larger subset can be formed. Thus correctly identifying the maximal subset size for trivial cases is not clear in the way we expect.

This indicates that even though the basic logic is present, it might not correctly represent all scenarios simply due to ignoring the requirement of how pairs need every combination evaluated/subset requirement checks.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing, the program logic does not strictly adhere to the stated requirements for every possible input case due to potential oversight on diverse number arrangements and combinations leading to complexities in divisible checks.

Correctness: **False**.
