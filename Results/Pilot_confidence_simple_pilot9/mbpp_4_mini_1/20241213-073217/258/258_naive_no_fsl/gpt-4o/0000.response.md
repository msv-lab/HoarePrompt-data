Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly determines whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. Hereâ€™s why:

1. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \( 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 \).

2. The code converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit, determines the number of digits, and computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.

3. The assertions provided check specific cases: 
   - `func_1(153)` returns `True` (correct).
   - `func_1(259)` returns `False` (correct).
   - `func_1(4458)` returns `False` (correct).
   
4. The function also handles all valid integers (positive and 0) correctly based on the definition of Armstrong numbers.

Since I can't find any example inputs for which the function doesn't perform as expected, it appears to be implemented correctly.

Thus, the code adheres to the problem description and works for the examples given.
