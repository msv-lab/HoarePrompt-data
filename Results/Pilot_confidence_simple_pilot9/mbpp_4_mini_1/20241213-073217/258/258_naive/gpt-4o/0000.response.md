Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) is one where the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits equals the number itself. 

The function does the following:
1. Converts the number to a string to easily access each digit.
2. Calculates the length of the string, which corresponds to the number of digits.
3. Computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits.
4. Compares this sum to the original number and returns `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise.

The provided assertions test the function using known Armstrong numbers (153) and non-Armstrong numbers (259 and 4458), which all pass correctly. 

Since the logic is accurate and the provided examples cover both cases effectively, I found no instance where the function fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
