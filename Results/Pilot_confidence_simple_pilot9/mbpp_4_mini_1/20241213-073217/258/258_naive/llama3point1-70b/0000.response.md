To determine if the provided program correctly checks whether a number is an Armstrong number, we need to analyze the logic used in the function against the definition of an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

### Analysis:
1. The function converts `num` to a string to iterate over each digit, which is correct.
2. It calculates the number of digits using `len(num_str)`, which correctly identifies the exponent for the Armstrong condition.
3. It initializes a variable `sum` to accumulate the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len`.
4. Finally, it checks if the calculated `sum` is equal to the original number `num`.

### Potential Issue:
However, there is a potential flaw in the program:
- The program does not handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs correctly. Armstrong numbers are typically defined for non-negative integers. If a negative number is passed, the program will still output `False`, but it does not explicitly account for the definition which implies only considering non-negative inputs. Additionally, the logic may not make sense for non-integer values.

### Conclusion:
Because the function does not explicitly handle inputs outside the scope of the definition (like negatives or non-integers), there is a possibility that the function does not behave as expected for all potential inputs.

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program should specify that it only accepts non-negative integers and ideally should raise an error for negative or non-integer inputs.
