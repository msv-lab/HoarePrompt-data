Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three lists and returns a single sorted list. It achieves this by concatenating the three input lists and then using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which sorts the combined list. This implementation is sound and should handle various edge cases, including:

1. All input lists being empty.
2. One or two of the lists being empty, while others contain elements.
3. Lists containing duplicate elements.

In all these scenarios, the `sorted()` function will return a correctly ordered list. Since I could not find any potential cases where the program could fail to meet the problem description, the program is correct.
