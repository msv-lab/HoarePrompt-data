Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where the input array has fewer than two elements. According to the problem description, we need to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. If the array has less than two elements (i.e., it is empty or has one element), the program should ideally return a value indicating that it's not possible to compute the difference (e.g., an error, None, or some sentinel value). 

For example, calling `func_1([])` or `func_1([5])` will lead to an incorrect behavior. The program will sort the array, which will not change anything for empty or single-element arrays, and then the loop to calculate `min_diff` won't execute. The result will remain as `float('inf')`, which is not a correct minimum difference in these cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not properly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
