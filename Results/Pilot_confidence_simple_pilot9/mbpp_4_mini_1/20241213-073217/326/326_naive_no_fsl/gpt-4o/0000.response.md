Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input array has fewer than two distinct elements. For example, if the function is called with a tuple containing the same element (e.g., `(5, 5, 5, 5, 5)`), it would return `0` because the condition `if n < 2` would be satisfied, and thus it would bypass the logic to find the minimum difference. However, the minimum difference should be defined as invalid or should raise an exception in such cases, as there are no two different elements to compare.

Additionally, the program should return a certain value or raise an exception for cases where all elements are identical or the array has less than two elements, as such cases do not fulfill the requirement of finding a minimum difference between any two distinct elements.

For example:
```python
assert func_1((5, 5, 5, 5, 5), 5) == ?  # This would be invalid
``` 

Since the program does not correctly handle this scenario, it is deemed incorrect.
