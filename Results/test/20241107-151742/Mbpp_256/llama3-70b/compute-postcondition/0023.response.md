According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 3, `num` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. Since `num` is equal to 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`count` is 3, `num` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3**
