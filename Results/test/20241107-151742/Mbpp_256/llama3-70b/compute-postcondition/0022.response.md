Postcondition: ***`count` is 2, `num` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If `func_2(num)` evaluates to true, then `count` is increased by 1, resulting in `count` being 3, `num` being 3, and `n` being greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, no changes occur, and the variables retain their initial values of `count` being 2, `num` being 3, and `n` being greater than or equal to 3.***
