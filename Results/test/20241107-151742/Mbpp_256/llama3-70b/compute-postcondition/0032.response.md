Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It contains a nested function `func_2` that accepts a non-negative integer `num`. The nested function `func_2` returns False if `num` is less than 2 or divisible by any number from 2 to int(num), and True otherwise. 

The function `func` then initializes count to 0 and iterates over a range from 2 to n-1. For each number in this range, it calls `func_2` and increments count if the result is True. The function `func` returns the final count, representing the number of times `func_2` returned True for numbers in the specified range.

Overall, the functionality involves calculating the count of numbers within a range (2 to n-1) where the nested function `func_2` returns True, based on the conditions mentioned.**
