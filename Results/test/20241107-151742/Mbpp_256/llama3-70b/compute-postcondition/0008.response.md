According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num` and `i`. If `i` is less than the square root of `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3. Since there is no change in the state of the program variables unless `num` is divisible by 3, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: *`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4*
