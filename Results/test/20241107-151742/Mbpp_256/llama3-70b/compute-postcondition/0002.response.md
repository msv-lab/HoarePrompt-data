According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. The loop iterates from 2 up to the square root of `num` (inclusive). Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is set to 2.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
