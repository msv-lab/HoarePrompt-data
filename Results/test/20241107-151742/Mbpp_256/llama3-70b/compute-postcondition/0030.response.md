Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns False if `num` is less than 2 or divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num`, and True otherwise. 

The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n`, iterates over the range from 2 to `n-1`, calls `func_2` for each number in the range, and counts how many times `func_2` returns True. The count is then returned. This behavior is only applicable when `n` is greater than or equal to 3.**
