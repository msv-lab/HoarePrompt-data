Example Answer:
The code checks if `num` is divisible by any number from 2 to int(num). If `num` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns True. Since the value of `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, the function will return True if `num` is divisible by any number from 2 to int(num). 
Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2**
