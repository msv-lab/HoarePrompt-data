The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 2, it returns 0. Otherwise, it initializes a list is_prime with boolean values based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to identify prime numbers up to n. The function then returns the sum of the is_prime list. If n is 0 or 1, the function does not correctly handle prime number identification as the algorithm expects n to be greater than 1.
