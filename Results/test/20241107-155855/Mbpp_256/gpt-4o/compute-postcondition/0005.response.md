According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `i` is such that `i * i` is less than `n`. Additionally, the loop requires `j` to be within the range of `i * i` and `n` with a step size of `i`. 

Before the loop starts, the state should be adjusted such that `i` is set to a value greater than or equal to 2 such that `i * i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 2, and `j` is equal to `i * i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `i * i`**
