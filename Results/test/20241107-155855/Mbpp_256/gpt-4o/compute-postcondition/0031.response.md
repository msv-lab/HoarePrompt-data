According to the code, the loop can execute again if the range defined by `range(i * i, n, i)` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 4, and `j` is `i * i + i`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated to the next value in the range defined by `range(i * i, n, i)`. In this case, `j` should be updated to the next value in the range. Therefore, `j` should be set to `i * i + 2*i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 4, `j` is `i * i + 2*i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
