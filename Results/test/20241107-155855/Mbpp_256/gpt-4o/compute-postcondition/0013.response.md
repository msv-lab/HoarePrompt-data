Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 2. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then after the loop executes, all multiples of the current `i` up to `n` will have their corresponding `is_prime` values set to False. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute.***
