According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is less than `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False. Since `j` is the iterator variable in the loop and it increments by `i` in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n` by adding `i` to it. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is less than `n + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
