Output State: **The loop sets the boolean values in the `is_prime` list to False for indices that are multiples of `i`. After the loop executes, `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3. If `n` is less than `i * i`, the loop does not execute.**
