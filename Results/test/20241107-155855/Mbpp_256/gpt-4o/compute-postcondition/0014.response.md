According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the next iteration will have `i` incremented by 1. Therefore, the next iteration will require adjusting `i` to 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3**
