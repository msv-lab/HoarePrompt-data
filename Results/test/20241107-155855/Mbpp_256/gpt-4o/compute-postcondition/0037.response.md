The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `n` is greater than 2, and `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False. The function then returns the sum of the `is_prime` list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the sum of the `is_prime` list based on the conditions specified. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 2, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the is_prime list after initializing the list with boolean values.**
