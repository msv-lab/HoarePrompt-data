According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` starts at `i * i`, it needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` should be greater than or equal to `i * i`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3**
