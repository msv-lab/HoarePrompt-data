According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `num` and `num` is not divisible by 2. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3, as it should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. There is no change in the state of `num` as it is not dependent on the loop iteration.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3**
