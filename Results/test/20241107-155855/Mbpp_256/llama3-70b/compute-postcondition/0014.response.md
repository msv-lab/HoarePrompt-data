The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a non-negative integer. The function has multiple cases for the output:

Case_1: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False.

Case_2: If `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the function executes a loop where `i` is the last value in the range [2, int(num)]. After the loop executes, `num` remains a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2.

Case_3: Similar to Case_2, if `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop executes, and `i` is the last value in the range [2, int(num)]. After the loop executes, `num` remains a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. The function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number based on the cases described.
