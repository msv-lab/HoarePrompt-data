According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 5, as it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 5**
