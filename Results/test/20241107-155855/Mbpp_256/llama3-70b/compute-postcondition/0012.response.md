Output State: **If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `num` remains a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is the last value in the range [2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1). If `num` is divisible by any `i` in the range, the function returns False. If `num` is not divisible by any `i`, the function does not return anything.**
