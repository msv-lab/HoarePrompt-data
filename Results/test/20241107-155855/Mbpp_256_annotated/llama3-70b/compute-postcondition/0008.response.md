According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is at least 2, `i` is 3, and `num` is a perfect square. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **num is at least 2, i is 4, num is a perfect square**
