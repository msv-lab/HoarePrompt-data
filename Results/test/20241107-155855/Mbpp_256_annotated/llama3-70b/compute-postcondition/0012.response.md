Output State: *num is at least 2. If num is a perfect square, the loop will check if num is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of num (inclusive). If num is divisible by any i, the function returns False. If num is not divisible by any i, the function does not return anything. If num is less than 2, the function returns False.*
