According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is at least 2, `i` is 2, and `num` is a perfect square. Since `num` is a perfect square, it implies that `num` is not a prime number and is divisible by at least one number other than 1 and itself. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be one more than the current value.
State: **num is at least 2, i is 3, num is a perfect square**
