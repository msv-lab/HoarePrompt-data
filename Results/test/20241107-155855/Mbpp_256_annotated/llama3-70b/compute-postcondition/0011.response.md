According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num` and `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is at least 2, `i` is 4, and `num` is a perfect square. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 5 to satisfy the condition `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **num is at least 2, i is 5, num is a perfect square**
