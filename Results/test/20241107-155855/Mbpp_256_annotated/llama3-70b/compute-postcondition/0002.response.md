According to the code, the loop can execute if num is at least 2. Before the loop starts, num is a non-negative integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to num is at least 2. In addition, since the range starts from 2 and goes up to int(num ** 0.5) + 1, for the loop to execute, i should be 2 and num should be a perfect square. 
State: **num is at least 2, i is 2, num is a perfect square**
