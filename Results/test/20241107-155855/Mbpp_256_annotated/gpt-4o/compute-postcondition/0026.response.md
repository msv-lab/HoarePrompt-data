Example Answer:
The element at index `j` in the `is_prime` list is set to `False`. Since `j` is 16, the element at index 16 in the `is_prime` list is updated to `False`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime` is updated with some elements set to `False`, `j` is 16**
