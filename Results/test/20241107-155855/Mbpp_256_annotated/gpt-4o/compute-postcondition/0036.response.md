Initial State: `n` is an integer, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values where each element represents a number from 0 to `n`, all initialized as True.

The code snippet updates the elements in the `is_prime` list to False for all multiples of prime numbers up to the square root of `n`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Example Answer:
The loop condition checks if `n` is less than 2, and if so, the loop does not execute, leaving `is_prime` unchanged. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop iterates and updates elements in `is_prime` to False for multiples of prime numbers up to the square root of `n`. The values of `n` and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values with elements updated based on prime number multiples, and the function returns the sum of the updated `is_prime` list.**
