According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. In this case, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 16 since `i` is 4 and the range starts from `i * i` which is 16. Additionally, to ensure the loop executes, `j` needs to be set to the starting value of the range which is `i * i` (16 in this case). 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime` is updated with some elements set to `False`, `j` is 16**
