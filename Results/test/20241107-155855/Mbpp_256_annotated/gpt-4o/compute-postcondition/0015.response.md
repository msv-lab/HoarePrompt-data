According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is at least 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. 

Before the loop starts, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`. For the loop to execute, `j` must start from `i * i` and increment by `i` until it reaches `n`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`, and `j` is `i * i`. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`, `j` is `i * i`**
