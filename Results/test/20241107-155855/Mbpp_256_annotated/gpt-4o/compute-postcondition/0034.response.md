According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 5 as it should be less than or equal to the square root of `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 5, `is_prime` is updated with some elements set to `False`**
