According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`, `j` is equal to `i * i`, `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently equal to `i * i`, and `i` is 2, `j` is 4 which is less than `n`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`, `j` is equal to `i * i`, `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`**
