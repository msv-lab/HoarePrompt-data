According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `j` is `i * i + i`, `is_prime[j]` is `False`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `j` should be less than `n`:
- Calculate the new value of `j` for the next iteration: `j = i * i + i = 3 * 3 + 3 = 12`
- Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will execute again.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements, `j` is 12, `is_prime[j]` is `False**
