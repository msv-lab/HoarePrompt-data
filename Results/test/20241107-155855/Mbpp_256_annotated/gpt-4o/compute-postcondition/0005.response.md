According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is at least 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, the loop will execute if the range specified by `range(i * i, n, i)` is valid. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state must be adjusted such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`, and `j` is equal to `i * i`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`, `j` is equal to `i * i`**
