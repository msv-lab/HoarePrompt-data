Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`. If i is less than 2 or n is less than or equal to i*i, no changes occur. After the loop executes, the elements in `is_prime` from `i*i` to `n-1` are updated to `False`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `is_prime` remain unchanged except for the elements updated in `is_prime`.***
