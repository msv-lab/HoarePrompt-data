According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, and `is_prime` has been updated to set some elements to `False` between `i*i` and `n-1`. Since the loop will execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4 for the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4, `is_prime` is updated with some elements set to `False`**
