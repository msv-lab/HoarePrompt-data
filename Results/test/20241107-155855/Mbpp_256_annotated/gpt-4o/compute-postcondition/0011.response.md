According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and the list `is_prime`. If `i * i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `False`, `j` is equal to `i * i`, `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
- `j` needs to be updated to `i * i`, so `j` becomes 4 * 4 = 16.
- `is_prime[j]` needs to be set to `False`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `False`, `j` is equal to 16, `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`**
