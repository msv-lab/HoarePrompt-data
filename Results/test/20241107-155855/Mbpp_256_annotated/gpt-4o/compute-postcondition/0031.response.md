According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and the elements in `is_prime` list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime` has some elements set to `False`, `j` is 16, and `is_prime[16]` is `False`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be such that it is less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 16 and is generated as `i*i` in the loop, the next value of `j` will be `i*i + i` which is 20.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime` has some elements set to `False`, `j` is 20, `is_prime[20]` is `False**.
