According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `j < n` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime` is updated with some elements set to `False`, `j` is 16. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value that satisfies the loop condition, which is `j = 20` in this case.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime` is updated with some elements set to `False`, `j` is 20**
