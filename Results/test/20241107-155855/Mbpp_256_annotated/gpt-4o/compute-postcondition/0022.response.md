Output State: **If n is less than or equal to i*i, the loop will not execute. If i is less than 2, the loop will not execute. After the loop executes, the values of `n`, `i`, and `is_prime` remain the same. The value of `j` will be `i*i` and the corresponding element in `is_prime` at index `j` will be set to `False`. Subsequent iterations will update the elements in `is_prime` at indices `i*i + i`, `i*i + 2*i`, and so on to `False`.**
