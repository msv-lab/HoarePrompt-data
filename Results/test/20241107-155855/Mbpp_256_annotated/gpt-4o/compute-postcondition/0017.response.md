According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements, `j` is `i * i`, `is_prime[j]` is `False`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently set to `i * i`, it needs to be adjusted to `i * i + i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements, `j` is `i * i + i`, `is_prime[j]` is `False**
