Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a non-negative number `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given number. It correctly handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to 2 by returning 0. For `n` greater than 2, it correctly updates the `is_prime` list based on prime number multiples up to the square root of `n` and returns the sum of the updated list. The code annotations also describe the functionality of the program accurately, and there are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
