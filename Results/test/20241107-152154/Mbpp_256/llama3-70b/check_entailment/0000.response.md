Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program defines a function `func_2` that correctly determines if a given number is prime or not.
- The `func_1` function correctly iterates through the range [2, n) and counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`.
- The code accurately follows the problem description and the output hints. The `func_2` function checks for prime numbers, and `func_1` correctly utilizes this function to count the prime numbers less than `n`.
