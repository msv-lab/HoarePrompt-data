Example Answer:
The function returns `False`, and the variables `n`, `num`, and `i` are not modified by the code snippet. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2, and the function returns False.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2, and the function returns False**
