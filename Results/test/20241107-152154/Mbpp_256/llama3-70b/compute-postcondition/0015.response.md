Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns False if `num` is less than 2. Otherwise, it iterates through a loop to check if `num` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `num`. If `num` is not divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns True. **
