According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is 2 or greater, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `num` must be 2 or greater, and `i` is now 2.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2**
