Output State: **If num is less than 2, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, n is a non-negative integer, num is not divisible by any number between 2 and int(num ** 0.5) + 1, and i is int(num ** 0.5) + 1. If num is divisible by any number in the range, the function returns False.**
