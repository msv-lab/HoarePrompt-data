According to the code, the loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater, and `i` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be considered. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3. 

Additionally, if `num` is divisible by 2 (num % 2 == 0), the function returns False and the loop will not execute again. Therefore, to continue the loop, `num` should not be divisible by 2.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is not divisible by 2, `i` is 3**
