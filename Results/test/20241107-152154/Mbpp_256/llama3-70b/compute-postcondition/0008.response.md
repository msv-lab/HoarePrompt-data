According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is not divisible by 2, `i` is 3. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is not divisible by 2, `i` is 4**
