According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
