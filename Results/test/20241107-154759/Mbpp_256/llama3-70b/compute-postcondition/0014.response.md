The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case 1: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False.

Case 2: If `num` is greater than or equal to 2 and is not divisible by any integer within the range of 2 to the square root of `num`, the function returns True. If `num` is divisible by any integer within this range, the function returns False.

Case 3: If `num` is less than 2, no changes are made to the variables.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to determine if the input `num` is a prime number by checking if it is divisible by any integer within the specified range. If it is prime, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
