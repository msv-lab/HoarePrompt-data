Output State: **If num is less than 2, the loop does not execute and no changes are made to the variables. If num is greater than or equal to 2, the loop iterates from 2 to the square root of num (inclusive). If num is divisible by any i within this range, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.**
