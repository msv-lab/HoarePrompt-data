Example Answer: 
The function returns `False`. Since the code snippet does not modify any variables and the initial state specifies that `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, the output state is `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and the function returns `False`.
Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and the function returns `False`**
