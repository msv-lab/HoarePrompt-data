# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def count_Primes_nums(n: int) -> int:

    count = 0
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return count
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function count_Primes_nums accepts a non-negative integer n and calculates the total number of prime numbers between 2 and n (excluding n). It iterates through the range from 2 to n (exclusive) and increments the count if the number is prime. If n is less than 2, the function returns 0 as the count.

Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function `is_prime` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and determines if it is a prime number. It returns False if `num` is less than 2 or if it is divisible by any integer in the range from 2 to the square root of `num`. Otherwise, it returns True. The function correctly checks for primality based on the code provided.

Now, let's analyze the code and the output hints to determine the correctness of the program.

Initial Assessment:
The code seems to correctly aim at counting the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`. The `count_Primes_nums` function iterates through the range from 2 to `n` (excluding `n`) and checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function. The `is_prime` function correctly identifies prime numbers by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number. The output descriptions also align with the code's functionality, emphasizing the counting of prime numbers and prime number identification.

Therefore, based on the initial assessment, the code appears to be correct as it follows the problem description and the provided output hints.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code performs as expected and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The `count_Primes_nums` function correctly counts the prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n` by iterating through the range from 2 to `n` (excluding `n`) and checking each number for primality using the `is_prime` function. The `is_prime` function accurately determines if a number is prime by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number. This ensures that the code handles all potential cases and provides the correct output.
