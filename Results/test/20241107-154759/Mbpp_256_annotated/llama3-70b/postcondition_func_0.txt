The function count_Primes_nums accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than 3, the function does not execute the loop. If n is 3 or greater, the function iterates through numbers from 2 to n-1, inclusive, to check for primality using the is_prime function. For each prime number found within this range, the count is increased by 1. After the loop completes, the function returns the count of prime numbers between 2 and n-1.
