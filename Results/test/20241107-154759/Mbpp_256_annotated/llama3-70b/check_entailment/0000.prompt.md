You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def count_Primes_nums(n):
    count = 0
    #State of the program here: `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 0
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If n is less than 3, the loop does not execute. If n is at least 3, the loop checks numbers from 2 to n-1 (inclusive) for primality using the is_prime function. For each prime number found within this range, count is increased by 1. Therefore, after the loop executes, count contains the number of prime numbers between 2 and n-1.
    return count
    #State of the program after the return statement: If n is less than 3, the loop does not execute. If n is at least 3, the loop checks numbers from 2 to n-1 (inclusive) for primality using the is_prime function. For each prime number found within this range, count is increased by 1. Therefore, after the loop executes, count contains the number of prime numbers between 2 and n-1. The function returns count.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If n is less than 3, the loop does not execute. If n is at least 3, the function checks numbers from 2 to n-1 for primality, increases count by 1 for each prime number found, and returns the count of prime numbers between 2 and n-1.


#Function 2:
def is_prime(num):
    if (num < 2) :
        return False
        #State of the program after the return statement: num is a non-negative integer, and the function returns False
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: num is a non-negative integer, and the function returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *num is a non-negative integer. If num is less than 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the variables.
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If num is less than 2, the function returns False. If num is 2 or greater, the loop iterates through the range from 2 to the square root of num. If num is divisible by i, then the function returns False. Otherwise, num remains a non-negative integer and i is an integer incremented by 1.
    return True
    #State of the program after the return statement: The function always returns True
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a non-negative integer. 
#
#Case_1: If num is less than 2, the function returns False. 
#
#Case_2: If num is 2 or greater, the function iterates through the range from 2 to the square root of num. If num is divisible by any number in this range, the function returns False. Otherwise, it continues iterating and updating the state of the variables. 
#
#Case_3: The function always returns True. 
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number based on the above conditions. If num is less than 2, it returns False. If num is 2 or greater, it checks for divisibility in the specified range and returns False if divisible, otherwise returns True.





I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
