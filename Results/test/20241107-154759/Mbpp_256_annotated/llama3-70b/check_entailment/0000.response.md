Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The `count_Primes_nums` function takes in a non-negative integer `n` and correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than `n`. 
- The `is_prime` function correctly determines whether a given number is prime or not based on the conditions provided in the problem description and annotations. 
- The annotations provide a clear explanation of the logic and functionality of both functions, and there are no contradictions between the code and the problem description. 
- Based on the problem description and the code provided, all potential cases are covered, and the code works as expected for all valid inputs.
