According to the code, the loop will execute until `i` reaches the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is an integer incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and we need to check if `num` is divisible by the new value of `i`.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is an integer incremented by 2**
