The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case_1: If num is less than 2, the function returns False. 

Case_2: If num is 2 or greater, the function iterates through the range from 2 to the square root of num. If num is divisible by any number in this range, the function returns False. Otherwise, it continues iterating and updating the state of the variables. 

Case_3: The function always returns True. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number based on the above conditions. If num is less than 2, it returns False. If num is 2 or greater, it checks for divisibility in the specified range and returns False if divisible, otherwise returns True.
