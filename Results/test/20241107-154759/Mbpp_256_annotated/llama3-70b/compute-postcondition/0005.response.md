According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer and `num` is 2 or greater. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be adjusted to the next integer after the last value it had in the range. Since the range starts from 2, the next value for `i` would be the last value + 1. Therefore, the state to be adjusted is `i` is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater, `i` is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`**
