According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `num` and `num` is a non-negative integer. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer and `num` is 2 or greater. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be the next integer after the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. Since the loop starts from 2, the next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` incremented by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be `i + 1`.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater, `i` is `int + 1**
