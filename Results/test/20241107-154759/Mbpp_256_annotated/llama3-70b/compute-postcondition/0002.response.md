According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False and the loop does not execute. If `num` is 2 or greater, the loop will execute with the range provided. Before the loop starts, `num` is a non-negative integer, so no adjustments are needed.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater**
