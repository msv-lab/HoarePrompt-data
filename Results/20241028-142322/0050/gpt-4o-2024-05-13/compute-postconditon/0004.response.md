Example Answer:
`max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from list `b`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `min_buy_price` is assigned the minimum value from the list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `min_buy_price` is assigned the minimum value from the list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from list `b`**
