Example Answer:
The code snippet creates a list `s` by mapping the input values to integers after splitting the input. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, and `s` is a list of integers created from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, `s` is a list of integers created from the input**
