According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 0 again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `x` is less than 0, `x` is negated, and `y` is decremented by the absolute value of `x`. Otherwise, there is no change. `i` is less than 0**
