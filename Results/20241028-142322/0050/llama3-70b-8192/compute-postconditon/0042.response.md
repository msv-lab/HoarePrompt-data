Postcondition: **If `shares` is greater than 0, the value of `r` is updated to the sum of the current value of `r` and the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, `shares` remains unchanged. If `x` is less than 0, `x` is negated, and `y` is decremented by the absolute value of `x`. Otherwise, there is no change. `i` is less than 0.**
