Example Answer:
The variable `shares` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. 
Output State: **`n, m, r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input and it is sorted in descending order; `shares` is 0**
