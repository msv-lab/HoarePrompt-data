Example Answer:
The value of `shares` is assigned 0, which means no shares are being calculated currently. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is assigned the value of `m`, and `r` is updated by adding `shares` multiplied by `b[i]`. Since `shares` is 0, the value added to `r` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c` remain unchanged, `i` is assigned the value of `m`, `r` is updated by adding 0.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` remain unchanged, `i` is assigned the value of `m`, `r` is updated by adding 0**
