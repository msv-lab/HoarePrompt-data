Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by sorting the buy and sell opportunities in ascending and descending order respectively. It then iterates through the buy opportunities to buy as many shares as possible with the available bourles. After that, it iterates through the sell opportunities to sell all the bought shares and calculates the total bourles after the evening. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem requirements, and it gives the correct output for all potential cases.
