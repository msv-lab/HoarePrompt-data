Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program iterates over all possible values of \( t \) from 1 to 100 and calculates the cost of making all stick lengths almost good for each \( t \). It keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding \( t \) value. This approach ensures that the program considers all potential cases and finds the optimal solution as described in the problem statement. Since the program handles all given examples correctly and the logic seems sound for all potential cases, the program is correct.
