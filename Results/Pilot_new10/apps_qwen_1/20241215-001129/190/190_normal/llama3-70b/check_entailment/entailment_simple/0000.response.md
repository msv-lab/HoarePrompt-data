Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it adheres to the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of sticks \( n \) and their lengths \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) from the standard input. It then sorts the lengths of the sticks, which helps in finding the median value efficiently.

2. **Initial Cost Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates the initial cost by setting \( t \) to the middle element (median) of the sorted sticks. This ensures that the cost of changing the lengths to be almost good for \( t \) is minimized initially.
   - The initial cost is computed using the formula \( \text{cost} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - t| \).

3. **Finding Minimum Cost**:
   - The program then iterates over a range from \( t - 1 \) down to 1 and another range from \( t + 1 \) up to 100 to find the minimum cost and corresponding \( t \).
   - For each candidate \( t \), it calculates the new cost by taking the minimum difference between the current stick length and the candidate \( t \) or \( t+1 \). This ensures that the cost is minimized by considering both possible adjustments (shrink or stretch).
   - The program updates the minimum cost and corresponding \( t \) whenever a lower cost is found.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the value of \( t \) and the minimum cost, which are the results of the above computations.

By following these steps, the program ensures that:
- It considers all possible values of \( t \) within the valid range.
- It computes the cost for each candidate \( t \) and selects the one with the minimum cost.
- It outputs the correct \( t \) and minimum cost as required.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the given problem, making it correct according to the problem description.
