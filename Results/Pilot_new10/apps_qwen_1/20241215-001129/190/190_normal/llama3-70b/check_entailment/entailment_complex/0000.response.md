Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths into a list `sticks`.
   
2. **Sorting**:
   - The sticks are sorted, which is crucial for finding the median (or middle element in the sorted list).

3. **Finding the Median (`t`)**:
   - The median value `mid` is calculated as `sticks[n // 2]`. This choice of `mid` ensures that the majority of the elements will be within the range `[mid - 1, mid + 1]`.

4. **Initial Cost Calculation**:
   - The initial cost of making all sticks almost good for `t = mid` is calculated using the formula `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`. This is the starting point for comparison.

5. **Optimization Loop**:
   - The program iterates over the range `[mid - 1, 0]` and `[mid + 1, 100]` to find the value of `t` that minimizes the total cost. For each potential `t`, it calculates the new cost as `sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks)`. This step ensures that the cost is minimized by considering the nearest neighbors.

6. **Updating Minimum Cost and Optimal `t`**:
   - During the iteration, the program keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t` value.

7. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the optimal value of `t` and the minimum cost.

### Why it is Correct:

- **Comprehensive Cost Calculation**: The program considers all possible values of `t` in the specified range and calculates the minimum cost for each, ensuring that the solution is optimal.
- **Handling All Cases**: The program handles all possible cases by iterating through the relevant ranges and updating the minimum cost accordingly.
- **Correct Output Format**: The output format matches the requirement of printing the optimal `t` and the minimum cost.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the given problem, making it correct.
