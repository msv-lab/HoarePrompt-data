Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the input. It then sorts the list and finds the median value. The function calculates the minimum cost of adjusting all elements in the list to either the median or one of its neighboring values. It iterates over the range `[median - 1, 0]` and `[median + 1, 100]` to find the value that minimizes the cost, and prints the optimal value and the corresponding minimum cost.**
