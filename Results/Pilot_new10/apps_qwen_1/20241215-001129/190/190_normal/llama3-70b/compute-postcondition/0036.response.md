To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions and variables involved in the given loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `cost` is the computed value of the sum \( \sum_{x \in \text{sticks}} \min(\lvert x - i \rvert, \lvert x - (i - 1) \rvert) \).
   - `min_cost` and `min_t` are updated based on the comparison between `cost` and `min_cost`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `mid + 1` to `100`.

3. **Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - `i`: The variable being incremented in the loop.
   - `min_cost`: The minimum cost encountered so far.
   - `min_t`: The value of `i` that gives the minimum cost.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the current iteration, `i` is the last value it was set to.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

### State at the Start of Next Iteration:
- **`cost`**: This value remains unchanged as it is not re-computed until the next iteration.
- **`i`**: This value will be `i + 1`.
- **`min_cost` and `min_t`**: These values will remain unchanged unless the new `cost` is less than `min_cost`, which hasn't happened yet.

### Updated State:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously `mid + k` (where `k` is some integer), then `i` will now be `mid + k + 1`.
- `min_cost` and `min_t` will remain as they were in the previous iteration.

### Final State:
- **`cost` is the computed value of sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)** (unchanged).
- **`i` is `mid + k + 1`** (where `k` is the integer such that `i` was `mid + k` at the end of the previous iteration).
- **`min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged**.

### Conclusion:
State: **`cost` is the computed value of sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks), `i` is `mid + k + 1`, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged**.

In a more concrete form, if `i` was `mid + k` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`cost` is the computed value of sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks), `i` is `mid + k + 1`, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged**.
