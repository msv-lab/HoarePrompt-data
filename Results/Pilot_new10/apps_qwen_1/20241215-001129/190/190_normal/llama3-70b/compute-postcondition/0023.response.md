Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks` and is greater than 0; `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and its adjacent elements, calculated with `i = mid - 2`; `t` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`; `i` is `mid - 2`; if `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` remains equal to `cost` and `min_t` remains `mid - 2`; otherwise, the values of `min_cost` and `min_t` do not change.***
