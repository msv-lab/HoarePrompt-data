Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state after all iterations have completed.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers.
- `t` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`.
- `min_cost` is the minimum possible sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and its adjacent elements.
- `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves this minimum cost.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
    cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)
    if cost < min_cost:
        min_cost = cost
        min_t = i
```

### Analysis
1. **Range of the Loop**:
   - The loop starts at `i = mid + 1` and goes up to `100`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each `i` in the specified range, the cost is calculated as the sum of the minimum absolute differences between `i` and each element in `sticks` and its adjacent element.
   - This means for each element `x` in `sticks`, we take the minimum of `abs(x - i)` and `abs(x - (i - 1))`.

3. **Update Conditions**:
   - If the computed `cost` is less than the current `min_cost`, both `min_cost` and `min_t` are updated.
   - Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.

4. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be the last value within the range `[mid + 1, 100]` for which the cost is minimized.
   - `min_cost` will be the minimum possible sum of the minimum absolute differences for any `i` in the range.
   - `min_t` will be the value of `i` that achieves this minimum cost.

### Final Output State
- The loop will execute for all values of `i` in the range `[mid + 1, 100]`.
- `i` will be the value in this range that minimizes the cost.
- `min_cost` will be the minimum possible sum of the minimum absolute differences for any `i` in the range.
- `min_t` will be the value of `i` that achieves this minimum cost.

Output State: **`i` is the value that minimizes the cost in the range `[mid + 1, 100]`, `min_cost` is the minimum possible sum of the minimum absolute differences for any `i` in the range, and `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves this minimum cost.**
