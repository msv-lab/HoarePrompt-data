`min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we only know that `min_t` is now `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`, `cost` is updated to the new sum of the minimum absolute differences, `t` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`, `min_cost` is now equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to `i`.**
