The line of code `min_cost = cost` assigns the current value of `cost` to `min_cost`. Since `cost` is already stated to be lower than the original `min_cost`, this assignment does not change the fact that `cost` is lower than `min_cost`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`, `cost` is updated to the new sum of the minimum absolute differences, `t` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`, `min_cost` is now equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to the original `mid`. The current value of `cost` is lower than the original `min_cost`.**
