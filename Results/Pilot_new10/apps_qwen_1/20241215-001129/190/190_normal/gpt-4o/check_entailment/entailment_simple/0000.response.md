Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths `a`. It ensures that `n` is between 1 and 1000 and each length `a_i` is between 1 and 100, which matches the constraints specified in the problem description.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The program iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100 (inclusive) and calculates the cost of making all sticks almost good for each `t`. The cost is computed using the formula provided in the problem statement, ensuring that the cost calculation is accurate.

3. **Optimization**: For each `t`, the program accumulates the cost required to make all sticks almost good. If the accumulated cost for a particular `t` is lower than the previously recorded minimum cost, the program updates the minimum cost and records the corresponding `t`.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the value of `t` that resulted in the minimum cost and the minimum cost itself, which is exactly as required by the problem statement.

Given that the program adheres to the specified constraints and accurately implements the logic to find the minimum cost and the appropriate value of `t`, the program is correct.
