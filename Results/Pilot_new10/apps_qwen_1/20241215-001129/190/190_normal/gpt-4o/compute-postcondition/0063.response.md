Postcondition: ***`length` is an integer, and `current_cost` is updated as follows: if `length` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, and specifically greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`. Otherwise, `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
