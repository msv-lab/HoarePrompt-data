According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `a` contains at least one element. 

Let's break down the states step by step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `a` is an empty list.
   - `current_cost` is 0.
   - `min_cost` is the minimum cost encountered.
   - `t` is 99.
   - `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over each element in `a` using `length` as the current element.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. Therefore, `a` needs to be modified to include at least one element.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `a` must contain at least one element.
- The other variables (`current_cost`, `min_cost`, `t`, and `best_t`) remain as they are because they are not directly involved in the loop's execution based on the given information.

**Final State:**
State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is the minimum cost encountered, `t` is 99, `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost` (which is equal to `t` if the if condition is true)**
