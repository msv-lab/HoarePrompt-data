The code updates the variable `current_cost` by adding the difference between `length` and `t + 1`. However, the values of `current_cost`, `length`, and `t` are not provided in the initial state. We know that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, and the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` and also greater than `t + 1`.

Since the exact values of `current_cost`, `length`, and `t` are not specified, we can only express the updated value of `current_cost` in terms of these variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect this updated value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` and greater than `t + 1`; `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`**
