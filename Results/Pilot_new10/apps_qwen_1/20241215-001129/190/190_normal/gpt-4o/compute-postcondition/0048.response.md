Postcondition: ***`a` contains at least one element, and `current_cost` is updated based on the length of `a`. If the length of `a` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated to its original value plus `t - 1 - length`. If the length of `a` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated to its original value plus `length - (t + 1)`. Otherwise, `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
