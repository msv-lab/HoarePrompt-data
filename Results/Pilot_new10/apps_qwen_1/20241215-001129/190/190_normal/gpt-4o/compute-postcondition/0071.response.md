The code updates `current_cost` by adding the difference between `length` and `t + 1` to `current_cost`. Since `length` is the next element in the list `a`, it remains unchanged from its previous value. The value of `t` is not specified, so it will be left as `t`. The updated value of `current_cost` is the original value of `current_cost` plus the difference between `length` and `t + 1`.

Output State: **`current_cost` is `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, `length` is the next element in the list `a`**
