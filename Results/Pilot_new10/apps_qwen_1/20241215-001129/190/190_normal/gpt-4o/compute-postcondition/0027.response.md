The code sets `best_t` to the current value of `t`. The initial value of `t` is 1, so `best_t` will be updated to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `a` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \), `min_cost` is \(0\), `best_t` is \(1\), `t` is \(1\), and `current_cost` is \(0\).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `a` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \), `min_cost` is \(0\), `best_t` is \(1\), `t` is \(1\), and `current_cost` is \(0\)**
