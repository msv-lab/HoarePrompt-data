`current_cost` is incremented by the value of `t - 1 - length`. The previous value of `current_cost` is unknown, but it is added to `t - 1 - length`. The value of `length` is updated to be the next element in the list `a`, but since the exact value of `length` is not given, we keep it as `length` which is now the next element in the list `a`. 

Output State: **`current_cost` is current_cost + t - 1 - length, `length` is the next element in the list `a`**
