Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers starting with 4, and `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length` if `length < t - 1`. If `length >= t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))` if `length > t + 1`. Otherwise, the state of `n`, `a`, and `current_cost` remains unchanged.**
