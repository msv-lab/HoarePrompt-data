Postcondition: ***`a` is an empty list, `current_cost` is the final cost calculated, `min_cost` is the minimum cost encountered which is either equal to `current_cost` (if the if condition is true) or remains the previous minimum (`0` if no update occurred), `t` is the final value of `t` after the loop execution, and `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost` (which is equal to `t` if the if condition is true).***
