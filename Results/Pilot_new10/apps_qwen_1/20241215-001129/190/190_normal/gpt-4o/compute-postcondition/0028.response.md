Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `a` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \), `min_cost` is either \(0\) (if `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`), or still \(\infty\) (if `current_cost` is not less than `min_cost`), `best_t` is still \(-1\), `t` is still \(1\), and `current_cost` is still \(0\).***
