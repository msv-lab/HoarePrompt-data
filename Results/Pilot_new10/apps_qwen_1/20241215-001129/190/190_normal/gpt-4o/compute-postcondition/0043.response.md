Postcondition: **`a` contains at least one element, and `current_cost` is updated based on the new length of `a`. Specifically, if the new length of `a` (denoted as `length`) is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to its previous value plus `t - 1 - length`. Otherwise, `a` contains at least one less element than before, and `current_cost` is updated by adding the difference between the old length of `a` and `(t + 1)` to its current value.**
