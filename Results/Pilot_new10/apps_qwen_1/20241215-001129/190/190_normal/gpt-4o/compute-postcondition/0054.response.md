Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `a` is an empty list.
   - `current_cost` is the final cost calculated.
   - `min_cost` is the minimum cost encountered, either equal to `current_cost` (if the if condition is true) or remains the previous minimum (`0` if no update occurred).
   - `t` is the final value of `t` after the loop execution.
   - `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost` (which is equal to `t` if the if condition is true).

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `t` in the range from 1 to 100.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be within the range of 1 to 100.
   - Since `t` is the final value of `t` after the previous iteration, it must be less than 100 for the loop to continue.
   - If `t` is 99 after the previous iteration, then `t` will be incremented to 100 for the next iteration, and the loop will stop as the range is from 1 to 100 (inclusive).

Given this, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is 99 (since it will be incremented to 100 in the next iteration, making the loop stop).

4. **Updated States**:
   - `a` remains an empty list.
   - `current_cost` remains the same as it is calculated within the loop.
   - `min_cost` remains the same as it is updated within the loop.
   - `t` is 99 (so it will be incremented to 100 in the next iteration, stopping the loop).
   - `best_t` remains the same as it is updated within the loop.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`a` is an empty list, `current_cost` is the final cost calculated, `min_cost` is the minimum cost encountered, `t` is 99, and `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost` (which is equal to `t` if the if condition is true)**.
