The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and a list of `n` integers `a` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 represents the lengths of the sticks. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but based on the constraints, it implies that the function might process or analyze these inputs. However, since no specific output cases are provided, we can only describe the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, where each integer in the list represents the length of a stick.**
