`current_cost` is assigned the value of `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)`. Given that `length` is an integer less than `t - 1`, the value of `t - 1 - length` will be a positive integer. Therefore, `current_cost` is increased by the value of `t - 1 - length`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`length` is an integer less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`**
