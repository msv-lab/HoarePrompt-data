Let's analyze the given loop and the initial conditions step-by-step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \)
- \( a \) is a list of \( n \) integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \)
- \( \text{min_cost} = \infty \)
- \( \text{best_t} = -1 \)
- \( \text{t} = 1 \)
- \( \text{current_cost} = 0 \)

### Loop Code:
```python
for length in a:
    if length < t - 1:
        current_cost += t - 1 - length
    elif length > t + 1:
        current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```

### Observations:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list \( a \).
- For each element \( length \) in \( a \):
  - If \( length < t - 1 \), then \( \text{current_cost} \) increases by \( (t - 1) - length \).
  - If \( length > t + 1 \), then \( \text{current_cost} \) increases by \( length - (t + 1) \).
  - If \( t - 1 \leq length \leq t + 1 \), then no change in \( \text{current_cost} \).

### Analysis:
- The loop updates \( \text{current_cost} \) based on the condition of \( length \) relative to \( t \).
- Since \( t \) starts at 1 and is not explicitly modified within the loop, the loop will always use \( t = 1 \) unless modified elsewhere in the program.
- Therefore, the conditions simplify to:
  - If \( length < 0 \): No change (since \( 1 - 1 - length = -length \)).
  - If \( length > 2 \): Increase \( \text{current_cost} \) by \( length - 2 \).
  - If \( 0 \leq length \leq 2 \): No change (since \( (1 - 1 - length) \) or \( (length - (1 + 1)) \) results in no net change).

Given the constraints \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \), the only relevant cases are when \( length \leq 2 \). Hence, \( \text{current_cost} \) will remain 0 throughout the loop since no valid \( length \) in \( a \) will cause an increase in \( \text{current_cost} \).

### Final Output State:
Since \( \text{current_cost} \) will not be affected by any iteration of the loop due to the constraints and the logic inside the loop, the final state of the variables will be as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `a` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \), `min_cost` is still \( \infty \), `best_t` is still \(-1\), `t` is still \(1\), and `current_cost` is still \(0\).**
