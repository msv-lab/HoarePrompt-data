`best_t` is assigned the value of `t`. The value of `t` is taken as the value of `best_t`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an empty list, `current_cost` is the final cost calculated, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `t` is the final value of `t` after the loop execution, and `best_t` is equal to `t`.

Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `current_cost` is the final cost calculated, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `t` is the final value of `t` after the loop execution, and `best_t` is equal to `t`.**
