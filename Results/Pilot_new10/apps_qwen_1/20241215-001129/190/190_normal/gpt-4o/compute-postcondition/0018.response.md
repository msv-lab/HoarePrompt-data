Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with the next element being 4, and `current_cost` is updated as follows: if `length < t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to its original value plus `t - 5`. If `length > t + 1`, then `current_cost` is increased by `3 - t`. Otherwise, the value of `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
