The code updates the `current_cost` by adding `t - 1 - length` to it. The initial state is that `a` contains at least one element, and `current_cost` is updated based on the new length of `a`. Since the length of `a` is affected by the update, let's denote the current length of `a` as `length`.

Given:
- `current_cost` is updated based on the new length of `a`.
- The length of `a` is denoted as `length`.

The code snippet updates `current_cost` as follows:
```python
current_cost += t - 1 - length
```

Since `a` contains at least one element, the length of `a` (denoted as `length`) is at least 1. However, the exact value of `length` is not specified, and `t` is also not defined in the initial state. Thus, we can express the updated `current_cost` in terms of the original `current_cost` and the given expression.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `current_cost` is updated to its original value plus `t - 1 - length`.**
