The code `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` updates the value of `dp[i + a]` by adding `dp[i]` to it. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `m` is an integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), the sum of `i` and `a` is less than or equal to `m`, and no other changes are made to `i`, `m`, or `a`, only the `dp` array is updated.

Here, `i + a` becomes `0 + a`, which is `a`. So, `dp[a]` is updated to be `dp[a] + dp[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is an integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and the sum of `i` and `a` is less than or equal to `m`; `dp[a]` is updated to `dp[a] + dp[0]`**
