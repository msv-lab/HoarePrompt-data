The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `m`, `a`, and `b`. Since the actual input values are not provided, we cannot specify exact values for `m`, `a`, and `b`, but we know they are integers within the given ranges.

Output State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` are integers, where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\)**
