The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list. The parameters `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). However, since these parameters are not passed to the function, they are not part of the function's input.

Given the output cases, the function must return different values based on some internal logic involving `m`, `a`, and `b`. Since these parameters are not part of the function's signature, we need to focus on the possible return values and their conditions.

Functionality: **The function returns values based on internal logic involving parameters m, a, and b, which are not provided as function arguments.**
