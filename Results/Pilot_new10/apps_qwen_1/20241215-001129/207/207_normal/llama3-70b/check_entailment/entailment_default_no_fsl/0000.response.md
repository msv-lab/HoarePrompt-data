Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in the code does not account for the fact that the frog can jump to both \( k + a \) and \( k - b \). This means that the code only considers jumps to the right (i.e., adding \( a \)) and not to the left (i.e., subtracting \( b \)), which is a critical part of the problem statement.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input: `10 5 3`

Expected output: We need to calculate \( f(0) + f(1) + \ldots + f(10) \).
- \( f(0) = 1 \)
- \( f(1) = 1 \)
- \( f(2) = 1 \)
- \( f(3) = 1 \)
- \( f(4) = 1 \)
- \( f(5) = 3 \)
- \( f(6) = 3 \)
- \( f(7) = 8 \)
- \( f(8) = 8 \)
- \( f(9) = 8 \)
- \( f(10) = 13 \)

Summing these values gives \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 13 = 42 \).

However, the provided code will not produce this result because it only considers jumps to the right and does not account for the leftward jumps. Therefore, the code fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one potential case, making the program incorrect.
