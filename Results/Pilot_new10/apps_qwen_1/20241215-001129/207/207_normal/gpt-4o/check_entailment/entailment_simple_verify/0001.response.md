Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly when the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) is not 1. The function `func_2` simplifies the problem by dividing \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\) by their GCD, but it does not properly account for the reachable positions within the interval \([0, x]\) for all cases. This leads to an incorrect result in certain scenarios, as demonstrated in the example case where the expected output is 15, but the program outputs 10. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be revised to handle all possible reachable positions correctly.
