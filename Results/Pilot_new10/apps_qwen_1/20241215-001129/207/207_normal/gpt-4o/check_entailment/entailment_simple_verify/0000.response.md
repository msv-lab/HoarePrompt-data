Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. Let's review the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\) and passes them to the `func_2` function, which is responsible for computing the required sum.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\). This is crucial for handling periodic jumps when the GCD is not 1.

3. **Recursive Case Handling**: The `func_2` function handles the case when the GCD is not 1 by recursively reducing the problem size using the GCD. This ensures that the problem is broken down into smaller, manageable subproblems.

4. **Base Case Handling**: When the GCD is 1, the function correctly computes the number of reachable positions within the interval \([0, m]\). The formulas used in the base case ensure that all reachable positions are correctly counted without overcounting or missing any positions.

5. **Summation Calculation**: The final summation part correctly combines the results from different intervals to get the total sum. The logic used in the summation calculations is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the detailed annotations and the logical flow of the program, it is clear that the program implements the correct logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
