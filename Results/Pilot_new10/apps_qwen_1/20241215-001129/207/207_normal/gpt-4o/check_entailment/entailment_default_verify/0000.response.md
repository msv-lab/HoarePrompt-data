Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1` (GCD Calculation)**:
   - The function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of two integers. This is a standard and efficient method to find the GCD.

2. **Function `func_2` (Main Logic)**:
   - The function `func_2` handles the core logic of the problem. It correctly uses the GCD to simplify the problem when necessary and applies the appropriate formulas to calculate the number of reachable positions.
   - The base case where `m < k` (with \(k = a + b - 1\)) is handled correctly by returning \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\).
   - For larger values of `m`, it correctly calculates the number of reachable positions by combining the results of smaller intervals.
   - The recursive calls ensure that the problem is broken down into manageable subproblems, especially when the GCD of `a` and `b` is not 1.

3. **Output Hints**:
   - The output hints accurately describe the behavior of both functions. They correctly explain how `func_1` computes the GCD and how `func_2` uses this GCD to solve the problem efficiently.

Given the correct implementation and the accurate descriptions in the output hints, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate. The program handles all cases as described in the problem statement and the provided examples confirm its correctness.
