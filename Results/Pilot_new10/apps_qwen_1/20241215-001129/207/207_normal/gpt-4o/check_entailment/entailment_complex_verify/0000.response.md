Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
The original assessment was accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of \( f(i) \) for \( i \) from 0 to \( m \). Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \) using the Euclidean algorithm. This ensures that the periodic nature of the jumps is handled appropriately.

2. **Recursive Case Handling**: In the recursive case, the function `func_2` divides \( m \) and the step sizes \( a \) and \( b \) by their GCD. This reduces the problem to a smaller, equivalent instance. The recursive calls continue until the GCD is 1, at which point the base case is applied.

3. **Base Case Handling**: When the GCD is 1, the function correctly computes the number of reachable positions within the interval \([0, m]\) using the formula derived from the arithmetic series sum. The calculations for `sum_k` and `sum_m` ensure that the correct count of reachable positions is obtained.

4. **Summation Calculation**: The final summation part combines the results from different intervals to get the total sum. The logic is sound and correctly follows the problem requirements.

The annotated code clearly supports these points, indicating that the program handles all cases correctly and computes the desired sum accurately. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
