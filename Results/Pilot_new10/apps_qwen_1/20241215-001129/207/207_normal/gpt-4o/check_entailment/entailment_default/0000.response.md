Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Let's break down the code and verify its correctness:

1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculation:**
   ```python
   def func_1(x, y):
       while y:
           (x, y) = (y, x % y)
       return x
   ```
   This function correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD is used to simplify the problem by reducing \(a\) and \(b\) to their coprime form if possible.

2. **Main Function:**
   ```python
   def func_2(m, a, b):
       g = func_1(a, b)
       if g != 1:
           return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
       k = a + b - 1
       if m < k:
           return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
       sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
       sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
       return sum_k + sum_m
   ```
   - **Base Case:** If the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) is not 1, the function reduces the problem by dividing \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\) by the GCD and multiplying the result by the GCD. This ensures that the problem is simplified to a smaller instance.
   - **Simplification to a Single Jump:** If the GCD is 1, the function calculates the number of reachable positions within the interval \([0, k]\), where \(k = a + b - 1\).
     - If \(m < k\), the number of reachable positions is simply the number of integers in the interval \([0, m]\), which is \(\frac{(m + 1)(m + 2)}{2}\).
     - If \(m \geq k\), the function calculates the sum of the number of reachable positions within \([0, k]\) and \([k + 1, m]\).

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code correctly handles all potential cases. It simplifies the problem when necessary and calculates the number of reachable positions accurately for both simplified and unsimplified cases. Therefore, the code is correct.
