Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code provides more insight into how the program operates, and it clearly shows that the program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval `[0, x]` for all values of `m`, `a`, and `b`. 

For instance, in the annotated code, the function `func_2` simplifies the problem by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by their GCD, but it does not properly account for the reachable positions within the interval `[0, x]` for all cases. As seen in the example case where `m = 6`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`, the program outputs `10` instead of the expected `15`. This discrepancy indicates that the program's logic is flawed, confirming the original assessment that the program is incorrect.
