Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code follows the problem description accurately for every potential case. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the code handles different scenarios:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This is used to simplify the problem when `a` and `b` share common factors.

2. **Recursive Simplification**: The function `func_2` simplifies the problem by dividing `a` and `b` by their GCD (`g`). This ensures that `a` and `b` are coprime, making the calculations simpler and more efficient.

3. **Base Case**: When `g` is not 1, the function recursively calls itself with simplified values and multiplies the result by `g`. This handles cases where `a` and `b` share common factors.

4. **Small Interval Case**: When `m < k` (where `k = a + b - 1`), the function directly computes the sum of the first `m + 1` natural numbers, which is correct because the frog can only reach a limited set of positions within this small interval.

5. **Large Interval Case**: For larger intervals, the function correctly breaks down the problem into two parts:
   - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which covers the initial segment where the frog can only reach up to `k-1`.
   - The additional sum from `k` to `m`, adjusted to avoid double-counting the overlap.

Since the code handles all described cases and examples provided, and there are no apparent logical errors or missing edge cases, the code is correct.
