Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements a solution to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. The program takes an integer `n` as input, then iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000 to find an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a number is prime. Given the problem constraints and the guaranteed existence of a valid `m`, the program will always find and print a suitable `m`. Therefore, the program works correctly for all potential cases within the specified range.
