Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds a value of `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. The program iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000 and checks if `n * m + 1` is a prime using the `func_1` function. If a non-prime number is found, it prints the corresponding `m` and breaks the loop. Given the constraints and the guarantee that such an `m` exists, the program will always find and print a valid `m` for any input `n` within the specified range.
