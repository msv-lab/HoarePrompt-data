Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly find a value of `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number for any given `n` within the specified range. Here’s why:

1. The program reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. It then iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. For each `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if this number is prime using the `func_1` function.
4. If the number is not prime, it prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

The `func_1` function correctly checks whether a number is prime:
- It returns `False` for numbers less than 2.
- It checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient way to determine primality.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), the program will always find a suitable `m` that makes `n * m + 1` non-prime, as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program works correctly for all potential cases.
