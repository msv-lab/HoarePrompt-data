According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `i` is less than or equal to `int(num)`.
- `num` is not divisible by `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold:
1. `i` must be increased by 1 from its current value.
2. `i` must still be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

Since `i` is currently 2, after increasing it by 1, `i` becomes 3. For the loop to continue, `3` must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that:
- `i` is now 3.
- `i` (which is now 3) must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

The condition `num` is not divisible by `i` remains the same since `i` is only being incremented.

State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, and `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`, and `num` is not divisible by `i`**
