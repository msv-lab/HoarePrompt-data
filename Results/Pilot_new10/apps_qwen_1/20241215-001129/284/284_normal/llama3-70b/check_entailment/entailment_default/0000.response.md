Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for the given hypothesis. For any input \( n \), the program iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number using the helper function `func_1`. If it finds a value of \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop. The helper function `func_1` correctly determines whether a number is prime by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number. Given the constraints and guarantees that an answer exists, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \) that proves the hypothesis wrong. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
