Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which is within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

2. **Loop through possible values of m**: The program iterates over all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000, checking if `n * m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function.

3. **Prime Number Check (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number `num` is a prime number. 
   - It returns `False` if `num` is less than 2.
   - It returns `False` if `num` is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`.
   - It returns `True` if `num` passes both conditions, meaning it is a prime number.

4. **Output**: When the program finds a value of `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, it prints `m` and breaks out of the loop. Since it is guaranteed that there exists at least one such `m` within the given constraints, the program will always find and print a valid `m`.

Therefore, the program correctly follows the problem description and ensures that it will always output a valid `m` for any given `n` within the specified range.
