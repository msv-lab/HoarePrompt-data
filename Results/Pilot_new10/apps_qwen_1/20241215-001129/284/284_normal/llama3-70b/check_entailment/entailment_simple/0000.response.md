Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly follows the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - Given a positive integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \)), the task is to find an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
   - The solution should output any \( m \) within the range \( 1 \leq m \leq 1000 \) for which \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program takes an integer \( n \) as input.
   - It iterates through possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it computes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this value is prime using the `func_1` function.
   - If `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False`, it means \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, and the program prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given number `num` is prime.
   - It returns `False` immediately if `num` is less than 2.
   - Otherwise, it iterates from 2 up to the square root of `num` and checks for any divisors.
   - If it finds any divisor, it returns `False`.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program ensures that for any valid \( n \) and \( m \), if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime, it will output \( m \).
   - Since the problem guarantees that there exists at least one such \( m \) (as the hypothesis is false), the program will always find and print a valid \( m \).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles all cases appropriately. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
