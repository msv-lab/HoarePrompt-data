Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which is within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

2. **Loop through Possible Values of `m`**: The program iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000. This ensures that the program checks a sufficient range of values to find a non-prime result for `n·m + 1`.

3. **Prime Check Function**: The function `func_1` correctly implements the prime-checking logic. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and for numbers that are divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of the number. This ensures that only prime numbers return `True`.

4. **Finding a Non-Prime Result**: For each value of `m`, the program calculates `n·m + 1` and checks if it is a prime number using `func_1`. As soon as it finds a non-prime result, it prints `m` and breaks out of the loop. Given that the problem guarantees that such an `m` exists, the program will always terminate successfully.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and handles all potential cases within the specified constraints, the output will be correct for every valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
