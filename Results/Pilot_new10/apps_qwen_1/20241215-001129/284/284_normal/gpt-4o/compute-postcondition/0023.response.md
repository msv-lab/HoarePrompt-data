Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(25 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3, and \(x \mod 5 \neq 0\), and \(x \mod 7 \neq 0\), and \(x\) is a prime number greater than or equal to 25; `i` is increased by 6 after the loop has finished**
