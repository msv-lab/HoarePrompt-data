Let's analyze the given conditions and the while loop step by step.

### Given Conditions:
- \(25 \leq x \leq 1000\)
- \(x > 3\)
- \(x\) is not divisible by 2 (i.e., \(x \mod 2 \neq 0\))
- \(x\) is not divisible by 3 (i.e., \(x \mod 3 \neq 0\))
- \(x \mod 5 \neq 0\)
- \(x \mod 7 \neq 0\)
- \(x \geq 121\)
- `i` is increased by 6

### While Loop Condition:
The loop runs as long as \(i * i \leq x\).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the current value of \(i\)**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 6 in each iteration, let's denote the number of iterations by \(k\).
   - If this is the first iteration, \(i = 6\).
   - If this is the second iteration, \(i = 12\).
   - And so on.

2. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as \(i * i \leq x\).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of \(i\) should satisfy \(i * i \leq x\).
   - The next value of \(i\) would be \(i + 6\).

3. **Calculate the condition for the next iteration**:
   - We need \((i + 6) * (i + 6) \leq x\).
   - Simplifying, we get \((i + 6)^2 \leq x\).

### State Adjustment:
- The key adjustment needed is ensuring that \((i + 6)^2 \leq x\).
- Since \(i\) was increased by 6 in the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect that \(i\) will be increased by 6 again for the next iteration.

### Final State:
- The value of \(x\) remains unchanged.
- The value of \(i\) will be \(i + 6\).

Thus, the state at the end of the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is an integer such that \(25 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3, and \(x \mod 5 \neq 0\), and \(x \mod 7 \neq 0\), and \(x \geq 121\); `i` is increased by 6**
