Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that \(25 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3, and \(x \mod 5 \neq 0\), and \(x \mod 7 \neq 0\), and \(x \geq 121\). If `x` is divisible by `i` or `x` is divisible by `i + 2`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
