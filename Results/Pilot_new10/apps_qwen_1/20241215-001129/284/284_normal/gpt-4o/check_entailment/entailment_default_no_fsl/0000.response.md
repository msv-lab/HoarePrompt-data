Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` from the input, ensuring that the input is within the specified range \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).

2. **Search for Counterexample**: The program iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000. For each value of `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if this value is a prime number using the `func_1` function.

3. **Prime Checking Function (`func_1`)**: The `func_1` function correctly implements the logic to check if a number is prime. It handles small primes (1, 2, 3) and uses a more efficient method for larger numbers, checking divisibility up to the square root of the number.

4. **Output Generation**: When a non-prime value is found, the program prints the corresponding `m` and breaks out of the loop. This ensures that the program outputs a valid `m` in the range \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\).

Given these points, the program should correctly find and output a counterexample for any given `n` within the specified range. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
