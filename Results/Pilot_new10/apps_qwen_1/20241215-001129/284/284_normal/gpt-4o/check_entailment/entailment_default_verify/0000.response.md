Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is not accurate because the program does not cover all possible cases for determining whether a number is prime. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly handle all numbers greater than 3. The function skips checking numbers between 5 and 23, which means it might incorrectly identify some composite numbers as prime. For example, the number 25 is a composite number, but the function would incorrectly return `True` for it because it does not check divisibility by any number between 5 and 23. This oversight means the program might fail to find a counterexample for certain values of \( n \), leading to incorrect outputs. Therefore, the program is not fully correct based on the problem description.
