Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the grasshopper needs to make multiple jumps across obstacles. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
7 3
T..#..G
```

In this case, the grasshopper starts at index 6 ('G') and the target insect is at index 0 ('T'). The distance between them is 6, which is divisible by `k` (which is 3). However, there is an obstacle at index 3 ('#'), so the grasshopper cannot jump directly to the insect. The program checks if the distance between `g` and `t` is divisible by `k` and if all intermediate cells are empty, but it fails to check if there are any obstacles in the path. Therefore, the program would incorrectly output "YES" in this case, making it incorrect.
