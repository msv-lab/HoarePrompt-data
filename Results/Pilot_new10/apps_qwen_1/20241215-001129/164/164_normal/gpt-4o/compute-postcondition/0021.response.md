Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `reachable` is `True`, `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string, the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` contains at least one element, and if `line[pos]` is `#`, the condition remains as is, otherwise no change to the variables.***
