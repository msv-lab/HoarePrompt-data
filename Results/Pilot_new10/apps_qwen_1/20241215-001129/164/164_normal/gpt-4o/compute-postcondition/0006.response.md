Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, the string is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string. If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, `G_pos` is set to the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line` and `T_pos` is set to the index of the original position of 'G' in `line`. If `G_pos` is not greater than `T_pos`, the values of `G_pos` and `T_pos` remain unchanged.***
