The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `reachable` is `True`, `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string, the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` contains at least one element, and `pos` is `G_pos + k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
