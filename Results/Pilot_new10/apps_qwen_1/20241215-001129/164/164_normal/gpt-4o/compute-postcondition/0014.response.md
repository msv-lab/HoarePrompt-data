The code `break` is executed without changing any variable values. It simply breaks out of the current loop or if statement it is inside. However, since the context suggests this is outside any explicit loop or if statement in the given snippet, the primary effect is the end of the current logical flow.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`
- `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'
- `line` is the input string
- `reachable` is `True`
- `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string
- The range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` contains at least one element
- If `line[pos]` is '#', the condition remains as is; otherwise, no change to the variables, and the current value of `pos` is equal to `T_pos`

Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`; `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `line` is the input string; `reachable` is `True`; `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string; the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` contains at least one element; if `line[pos]` is '#', the condition remains as is; otherwise, no change to the variables, and the current value of `pos` is equal to `T_pos`.**
