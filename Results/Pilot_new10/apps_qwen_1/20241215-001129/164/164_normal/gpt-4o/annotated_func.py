#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The second line is a string of length n containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' represents an empty cell, '#' represents a cell with an obstacle, 'G' represents the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' represents the insect's position. It is guaranteed that 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once in the string.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    if (G_pos > T_pos) :
        G_pos, T_pos = T_pos, G_pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, the string is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string. If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, `G_pos` is set to the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line` and `T_pos` is set to the index of the original position of 'G' in `line`. If `G_pos` is not greater than `T_pos`, the values of `G_pos` and `T_pos` remain unchanged.
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `reachable` is `True` if `pos` reaches `T_pos` without encountering `'#'`; otherwise, `reachable` is `False`, `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string, the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` is checked during the loop, and if `line[pos]` is `'#'` at any point, the loop breaks.
    if reachable :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, if `reachable` is `True` upon exit from the if-else block, the output is 'YES'; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq n - 1 \), and a string of length \( n \) containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. It then determines if the grasshopper can reach the insect within \( k \) moves, where each move can either be to the left or to the right, and prints 'YES' if the grasshopper can reach the insect within \( k \) moves, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function checks the positions of the grasshopper ('G') and the insect ('T'), sorts their positions if necessary, and iterates through the range from the grasshopper's position to the insect's position in steps of \( k \), checking for obstacles ('#'). If an obstacle is found or the grasshopper cannot reach the insect within \( k \) moves, the function prints 'NO'. If the grasshopper reaches the insect's position, the function prints 'YES'.
