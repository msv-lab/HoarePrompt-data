Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here’s why:

1. **Jump Length Check**: The program iterates through the cells in steps of `k` starting from `G_pos` to `T_pos`. However, it does not account for the possibility that the grasshopper might jump beyond `T_pos` or that the grasshopper cannot make a jump over an obstacle (`#`). The program simply checks if `line[pos]` is `#` and stops, but it does not ensure that the grasshopper lands exactly on `T_pos`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Jump Validation**: The program should check if the grasshopper can reach `T_pos` by validating that all cells in the path from `G_pos` to `T_pos` are either empty or the final cell is `T_pos`. However, the current implementation only checks if the current cell is an obstacle and stops, which is insufficient.

3. **Range and Boundary Conditions**: The program uses a `for` loop to iterate from `G_pos` to `T_pos` in steps of `k`. This loop does not handle cases where `G_pos` and `T_pos` are not aligned properly with respect to `k`. For example, if `G_pos` is 2 and `k` is 3, the loop will skip over `T_pos` if `T_pos` is not a multiple of `k` from `G_pos`.

To fix these issues, the program needs to ensure that the grasshopper can land exactly on `T_pos` by checking all intermediate cells for obstacles and ensuring the final position is `T_pos`.

A corrected version of the program would involve checking each possible jump position to ensure there are no obstacles and that the final position is `T_pos`. Here’s a brief outline of how the corrected logic could look:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    
    if (G_pos > T_pos):
        G_pos, T_pos = T_pos, G_pos
    
    if (T_pos - G_pos) % k != 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    reachable = True
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            reachable = False
            break
    
    if reachable:
        if line[T_pos] == 'T':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the grasshopper can land exactly on `T_pos` and handles boundary conditions appropriately.
