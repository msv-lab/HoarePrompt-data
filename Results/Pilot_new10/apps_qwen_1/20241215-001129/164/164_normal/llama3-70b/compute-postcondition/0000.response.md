`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The input is read using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into multiple values based on whitespace. These values are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since the exact input values are not specified, we cannot provide specific values for `n` and `k`, but we know they follow the given constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive**
