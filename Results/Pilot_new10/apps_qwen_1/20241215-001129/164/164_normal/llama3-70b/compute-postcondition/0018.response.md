The code assigns the current value of `i` to `t`. Since the value of `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `t` will hold the value of `i` just before the increment happens. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, we can only say that `t` is updated to the current value of `i`.

Given that the initial state of `i` is its value at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and without knowing the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`. Therefore, `t` will be set to `i_current`.

The output state will be:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive.
- `s` is a string input from the user.
- `g` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `g` is -1.
- `t` is now equal to the current value of `i` (which was `i_current`).
- `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive; `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive; `s` is a string input from the user; `g` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `g` is -1; `t` is equal to the current value of `i`; `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**
