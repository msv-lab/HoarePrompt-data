`t` is assigned the value of the index `i` of the string `s`. The value of `i` is such that the character at index `i` of `s` is 'T'. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is -1, `t` is equal to the index `i` of the string `s` where `s[i]` is 'T'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is -1, `t` is equal to the index `i` of the string `s` where `s[i]` is 'T'**
