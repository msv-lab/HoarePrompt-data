According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive,
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive,
- `s` is a string input from the user,
- `g` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `g` is -1,
- `t` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'T' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `t` remains -1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` (the loop variable) needs to be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`.

Since `i` was less than `n` to enter the current iteration, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will be equal to the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. Therefore, `i` should now be one more than its previous value, and it must still be less than `n`.

So, the updated states are:

- `n` remains the same,
- `k` remains the same,
- `s` remains the same,
- `g` remains the same,
- `t` remains the same,
- `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `g` is -1, `t` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'T' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `t` remains -1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1 and must be less than `n`**.
