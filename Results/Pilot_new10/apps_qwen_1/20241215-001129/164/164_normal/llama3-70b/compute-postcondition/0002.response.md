`g` and `t` are assigned the value `-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is `-1`, `t` is `-1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is `-1`, `t` is `-1`**
