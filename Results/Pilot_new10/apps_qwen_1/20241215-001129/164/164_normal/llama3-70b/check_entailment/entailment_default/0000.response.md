Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` only checks if there are no obstacles along the direct path between the grasshopper and the target, but it does not account for the possibility of wrapping around the line. This means that if the grasshopper needs to wrap around the line to reach the target, the code will incorrectly return 'NO'.

For example, consider the following input:

```
8 3
#G##T##
```

In this case, the grasshopper can jump to the right three cells each time, and it can wrap around the line to reach the target. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return 'NO' because it does not check for wrap-around paths.

To fix this, the code needs to check for both direct and wrapped-around paths. One way to do this is to simulate the grasshopper's jumps starting from both the grasshopper's and the target's positions until they meet or an obstacle is encountered.
