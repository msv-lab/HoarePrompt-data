Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a few issues that make it incorrect for every potential case:

1. **Wrap-around Condition Handling**: The code uses the modulo operator `%` to handle wrap-around conditions, but it does not properly check if the grasshopper can jump from its starting position to the target position within the bounds of the line. Specifically, the condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` does not ensure that the grasshopper can reach the target position directly without hitting an obstacle.

2. **Edge Case for Wrap-Around**: Consider the following case:
   ```
   Input:
   6 2
   G###T#
   ```
   In this case, the grasshopper starts at position 0 and the target is at position 5. The distance between them is 5, which is divisible by 2. However, the grasshopper cannot jump directly to the target because there are obstacles in between. The code should handle this scenario correctly.

3. **Handling Starting and Target Positions**: The code assumes that the starting and target positions are valid, but it does not explicitly check if these positions are valid (i.e., not both starting and target are at the same position).

To fix these issues, the code should be modified to properly handle wrap-around conditions and ensure that the path from the starting position to the target position is clear. Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    elif g == t:
        print('YES')
    else:
        # Calculate the relative position difference
        diff = (t - g) % n
        if diff % k != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Check if there are no obstacles in the path
            jumps = [g + i * k % n for i in range(diff // k + 1)]
            if all(s[j] != '#' for j in jumps):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This revised code correctly handles the wrap-around condition and ensures that there are no obstacles in the path from the starting position to the target position.
