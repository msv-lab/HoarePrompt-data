Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values `n` and `k` from the first line and the string `s` from the second line, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Identifying Positions**: The program correctly identifies the positions of the grasshopper (`g`) and the target insect (`t`) within the string `s`. If either `g` or `t` is not found, the program immediately prints "NO", which aligns with the problem statement's requirement that both 'G' and 'T' must appear exactly once.

3. **Jump Validity Check**: The program checks if the absolute difference between the positions of `g` and `t` is divisible by `k`. This ensures that the grasshopper can potentially make a series of jumps of length `k` to reach the insect. Additionally, the program checks that there are no obstacles (`'#'`) in the path between the grasshopper and the insect. This is done using the condition `all(s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))`.

4. **Output**: Based on the conditions checked, the program prints "YES" if the grasshopper can reach the insect, and "NO" otherwise. This output matches the problem statement's requirement.

Since the program handles all the specified cases and correctly determines whether the grasshopper can reach the insect, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.
