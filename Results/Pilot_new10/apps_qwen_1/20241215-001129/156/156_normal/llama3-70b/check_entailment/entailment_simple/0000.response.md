Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Let's analyze why:

1. **Path Traversal Logic**:
   - According to the problem description, Lara's movement pattern is:
     - Move from (1, 1) to (n, 1).
     - Then move in a snake-like pattern starting from (n, 2) and going up to (2, 2), then (1, 2), and so on.
   - However, the provided program does not simulate this exact path. Instead, it uses a different logic to determine the position after `k` moves, which may not correctly represent Lara's path through the dungeon.

2. **Boundary Conditions and Movement Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the final position based on the value of `k` modulo `n * 2 - 2`. This logic does not accurately reflect the described snake-like movement pattern.
   - Specifically, the formula used to calculate the row and column positions in the snake-like pattern does not match the described sequence of movements.

3. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input `4 3 0`, the expected output is `1 1`, but the program outputs the same due to the modulo operation.
   - For the input `4 3 11`, the expected output is `1 2`, but the program outputs `3 2`, which is incorrect because it does not follow the snake-like path described.
   - For the input `4 3 7`, the expected output is `3 2`, but the program outputs `3 2`, which seems correct at first glance but fails to generalize for other cases.

To correctly implement the solution, the program needs to simulate Lara's path step-by-step, ensuring that it accurately reflects the described movement pattern. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
