Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies an issue with the program's handling of the boundary condition when `k` is exactly equal to `n * 2 - 2`. The output hints also confirm that the program does not explicitly handle this case, which leads to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. For example, the input `(4, 3, 8)` should result in the output `(1, 2)`, but the current implementation does not produce this output. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be corrected to handle this specific case.
