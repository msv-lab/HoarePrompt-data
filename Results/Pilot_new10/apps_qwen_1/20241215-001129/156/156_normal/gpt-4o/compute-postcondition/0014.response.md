Postcondition: **`n` is a positive even integer such that 2 ≤ n, `m` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m. If `k < n - 1`, then `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is decremented by `n - 1`, and the following holds: `full_rows = k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`, `row` is either `n - full_rows` depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, and `col` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `full_rows` is even or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is odd.**
