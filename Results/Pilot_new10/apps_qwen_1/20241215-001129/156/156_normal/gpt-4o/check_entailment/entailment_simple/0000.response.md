Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down how the program meets each requirement:

1. **Initial Position and Movement Pattern:**
   - Lara starts at cell (1, 1).
   - She first moves down to cell (n, 1).
   - Then she starts moving in a snake-like pattern from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner.

2. **Movement Calculation:**
   - The program correctly handles the initial movement to cell (n, 1) and then calculates the subsequent movements in the snake-like pattern.
   - It accounts for the total number of steps (`k`) and breaks it down into segments corresponding to full rows and the remaining steps within those rows.

3. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - For `k < n - 1`, the program directly prints the current position as (k+1, 1).
   - For `k â‰¥ n - 1`, the program subtracts `n - 1` from `k` and then calculates the row and column based on the remaining steps and whether `full_rows` (number of full rows traversed) is even or odd.

4. **Row and Column Calculation:**
   - The row is calculated as `n - full_rows`.
   - The column is determined based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, ensuring that the snake-like pattern is correctly followed.

5. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program reads input correctly and outputs the final position in the required format.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, it accurately determines Lara's current position based on the number of moves (`k`). Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
