You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if full_rows % 2 == 0:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        print(row, col)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all potential cases correctly based on the problem description. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Movement Downward**: For the first `n-1` moves, Lara moves down from the first column to the last row. This part of the logic is correctly implemented with the condition `if k < n - 1`.

2. **Snake-like Movement**: After the initial downward movement, Lara starts moving in a snake-like pattern, first to the right and then upwards. The program correctly calculates the number of full rows and the remaining steps within those rows.

3. **Handling Even and Odd Rows**: The program handles both even and odd full rows correctly by adjusting the row and column positions based on whether the full rows count is even or odd.

Given these points, the program should cover all scenarios described in the problem statement. Since the program correctly handles the boundary conditions and the logic for both the initial downward movement and the subsequent snake-like movement, it can be concluded that the program is correct. There are no obvious cases where the program would fail based on the provided logic and examples.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an even positive integer between 2 and \(10^9\)), `m` (a positive integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\)), and `k` (an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\)). It prints the coordinates `(row, col)` based on the given values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. If `k < n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`. Otherwise, it adjusts `k` by subtracting `n - 1`, calculates `full_rows` and `remaining_steps`, and determines the row and column based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. Specifically, if `full_rows` is even, the row is `n - full_rows` and the column is `2 + remaining_steps`; if `full_rows` is odd, the row is `n - full_rows` and the column is `m - remaining_steps`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
