Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle the scenario when `k` is exactly equal to `n * 2 - 2`. According to the problem description, when Lara reaches the end of the snake-like movement, she should be in cell `(1, 2)`. However, the current implementation does not explicitly handle this boundary condition, leading to potential errors.

For example, consider the following input:

**Input**
```
4 3 8
```

The expected output should be:
```
1 2
```

However, the current program will not produce this output because it does not correctly handle the case when `k` is exactly `n * 2 - 2`.

To fix this, we need to add a specific check for this condition:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k == n * 2 - 2:
        print(1, 2)
    else:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
```

With this correction, the program should handle all cases correctly.
