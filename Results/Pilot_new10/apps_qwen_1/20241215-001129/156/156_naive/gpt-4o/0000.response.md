Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines Lara's current position after she has moved \(k\) times according to the specified rules. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Movement**: Lara starts at \((1, 1)\) and moves down to \((n, 1)\). This covers \(n - 1\) steps.
2. **Snake Fashion Movement**: After reaching \((n, 1)\), she starts moving in a snake-like pattern:
   - Moves right until she reaches \((n, m)\).
   - Moves up one cell and then to the left until she reaches \((n-1, 2)\).
   - Repeats the process until she runs out of unvisited cells.

The program correctly handles these movements and calculates the final position based on the number of steps \(k\):

- If \(k < n - 1\), it directly prints the cell \((k + 1, 1)\).
- For \(k \geq n - 1\), it calculates the remaining steps after accounting for the initial downward movement. It then determines the row and column based on whether the number of full rows traveled is even or odd.

The program handles all edge cases and examples provided, ensuring that the output matches the expected positions for different values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). Therefore, the program is correct.
