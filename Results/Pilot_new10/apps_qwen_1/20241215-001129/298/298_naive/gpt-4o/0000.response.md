Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the calculated area is not an integer but close to an integer due to floating-point precision issues. Specifically, when `n * m` is not divisible by `k`, the area calculation might result in a float value that is very close to an integer but not exactly an integer. This can lead to printing "NO" incorrectly.

For example, consider the input `4 4 3`. The area should be `4 * 4 / 3 = 16 / 3 â‰ˆ 5.3333`, which is not an integer. However, the program checks if this value is exactly an integer using `int(area)`, which will fail. Therefore, the program should handle such cases more robustly by checking if the area is close enough to an integer within a small tolerance, or by using integer arithmetic to ensure exact calculations.
