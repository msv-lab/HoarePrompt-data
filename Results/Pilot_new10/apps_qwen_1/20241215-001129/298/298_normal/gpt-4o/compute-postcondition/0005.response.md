The code `area = int(area)` converts the value of `area` to an integer. Since `area` is already defined as `n * m / k` and it is mentioned that `area` is an integer, converting it to an integer using `int()` does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `area` remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k`**
