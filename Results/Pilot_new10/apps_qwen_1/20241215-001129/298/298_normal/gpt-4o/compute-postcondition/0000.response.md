The code reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the actual input values are not provided, the output state will reflect that these variables are now assigned the values of the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
