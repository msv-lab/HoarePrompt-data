The code `print('0 0')` prints the string `'0 0'` to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `area`, or the output being `'YES'`. Therefore, the only change is in the printed output, which is explicitly stated in the code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k`, the output is '0 0'**
