The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to iteratively reduce the problem until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
