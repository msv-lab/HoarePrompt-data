Precondition: **a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\).** 

Explanation: The function `func_3` takes two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) as input and calls another function `func_2` which presumably returns two integers \(x\) and \(y\). Then `func_3` returns a triplet \((x, y, x \cdot a + y \cdot b)\). Given the context of the problem, \(a\) and \(b\) represent the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of the grid, respectively, scaled by some factor related to the value of \(k\).
