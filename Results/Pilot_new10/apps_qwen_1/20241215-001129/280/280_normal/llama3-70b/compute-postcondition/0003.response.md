`min_speed` is assigned the value of `min(v1, v2)`. Given that `v1` is `a` and `v2` is `b`, `min_speed` will take the minimum value between `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables (`v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, and `max_speed`) are not affected.

Output State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is an integer input, `d` is an integer input, `max_speed` is the maximum of `a` and `b`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `a` and `b`**
