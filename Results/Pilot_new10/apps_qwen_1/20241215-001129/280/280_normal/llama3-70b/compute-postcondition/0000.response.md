The code `v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `v1` and `v2`. The values of `t` and `d` are not affected by this code.

Let's denote the input values as `a` and `b` (where `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 100). After executing the code, `v1` will be assigned the value of `a`, and `v2` will be assigned the value of `b`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `v1` is now the value of `a`
- `v2` is now the value of `b`
- `t` remains unchanged
- `d` remains unchanged

Output State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10**
