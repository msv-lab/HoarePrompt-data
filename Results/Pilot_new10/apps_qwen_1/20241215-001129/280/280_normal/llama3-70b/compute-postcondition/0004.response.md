The code sets `max_length` to the product of `max_speed` and `t`. Since `max_speed` is the maximum of `a` and `b`, and `t` is an integer input, `max_length` will be calculated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is an integer input, `d` is an integer input, `max_speed` is the maximum of `a` and `b`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`**
