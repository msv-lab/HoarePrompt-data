`min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. The initial state gives us that `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`.

Let's denote the initial values as follows:
- `max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`

After running the code snippet:
- `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.

Since `max_speed` is defined as `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, it implies that `max_speed` is already set to its final value based on the initial state. Thus, the value of `max_speed` does not change. 

Therefore, the new value of `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and the current value of `max_speed`.

Output State: **`max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.**
