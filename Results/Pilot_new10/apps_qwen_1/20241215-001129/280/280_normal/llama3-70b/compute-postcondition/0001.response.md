`t` and `d` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `t` (previously constrained between 2 and 100) are not affected by this operation. However, the specific values of `t` and `d` depend on user input.

Since the exact input values are not provided, the output state will reflect the assignment of the input values to `t` and `d`.

Output State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is an integer input, `d` is an integer input**
