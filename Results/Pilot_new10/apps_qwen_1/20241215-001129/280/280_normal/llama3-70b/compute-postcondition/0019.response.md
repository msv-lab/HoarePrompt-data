`max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`. The exact value of `max_length` depends on its initial state, which is either `3M` or `2M + m`. The value of `max_speed` is also dependent on the initial state of `max_length` and `m`, but since the exact values are not specified, we'll consider the general form.

Let's analyze the two possible cases for `max_length`:

1. If `max_length` is `3M`:
   - `max_speed` would be calculated as `max(M - d, min(m + d, M))`.
   - `max_length` would then become `3M + max(M - d, min(m + d, M))`.

2. If `max_length` is `2M + m`:
   - `max_speed` would be calculated as `max(m - d, m)`.
   - `max_length` would then become `(2M + m) + max(m - d, m)`.

Since the exact values of `M`, `d`, and `m` are not given, we'll express `max_length` in terms of these variables. 

Output State: **`max_length` is either `3M + max(M - d, min(m + d, M))` or `(2M + m) + max(m - d, m)`; `max_speed` is either `max(M - d, min(m + d, M))` or `max(m - d, m)`; `min_speed` is the minimum of (current `min_speed` + d) and `max_speed`; `min_length` is original_min_length + m + min(m + d, max_speed); `i` is 2**
