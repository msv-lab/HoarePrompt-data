The code updates `max_length` by adding `max_speed` to its current value. The initial values of `max_length` is 2M, and `max_speed` is either M or m. Since `max_speed` can be either M or m, we will consider both cases:

1. If `max_speed` is M, then `max_length` becomes `2M + M = 3M`.
2. If `max_speed` is m, then `max_length` becomes `2M + m`.

The other variables (`max_speed`, `min_speed`, and `min_length`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`max_length` is either 3M or 2M + m; `max_speed` is either M or m; `min_speed` is min(m + d, max_speed); `min_length` is increased by m.**
