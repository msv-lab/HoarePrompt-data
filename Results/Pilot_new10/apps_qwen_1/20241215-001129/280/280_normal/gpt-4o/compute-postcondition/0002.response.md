The code initializes a list `speeds` with `t` number of zeros. This means `speeds` will be a list containing `t` elements, each initialized to 0. The values of `d`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer entered by the user, `d` is the second integer entered by the user, `v1` is no longer defined, `v2` is no longer defined, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements, each initialized to 0.**
