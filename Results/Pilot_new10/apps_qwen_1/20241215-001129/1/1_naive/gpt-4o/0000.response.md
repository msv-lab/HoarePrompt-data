Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not ensure that the substring between the two colons contains only vertical line characters. Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
|[a:b:|]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

This input is correctly handled by the program, but consider another input:

**Input:**
```
|[a:b:|x]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
5
```

The program should return `-1` because the substring `b:|x` contains a character `x` that is not a vertical line character, making it impossible to form a valid accordion. The current implementation counts all characters between the colons, including non-pipe characters, which leads to incorrect results.
