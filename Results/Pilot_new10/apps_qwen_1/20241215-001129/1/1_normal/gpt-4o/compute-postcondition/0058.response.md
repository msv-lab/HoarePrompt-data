The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables directly. Instead, it breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since no such loop or match-case statement is present in the given code snippet, the only impact is that the execution would exit the context where this `break` statement is placed. However, based on the initial state provided and the fact that no loop or match-case is shown, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `bind - 1`, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is `i`, and the current value of `s[i]` is `:` if a colon is found, otherwise `end_colon` remains `-1`.**
