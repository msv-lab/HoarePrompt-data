Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is -1, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is the index of the last colon found during the loop execution or -1 if no colon is found, and `(start_colon != -1 and end_colon != -1 and start_colon < end_colon)`**
