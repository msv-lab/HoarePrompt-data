The code `end_colon = i` assigns the value of `i` to `end_colon`. Based on the initial state, `i` is `bind - 2`, and `ind` is a non-negative integer less than `bind`, and `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, while `end_colon` is `i` if a colon is found at `s[i]`; otherwise, `end_colon` remains `-1`. Since the code directly assigns `i` to `end_colon`, `end_colon` now holds the value of `i`.

The other variables (`total`, `ind`, `start_colon`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `total` is 0
- `i` is `bind - 2`
- `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`
- `start_colon` is `ind + 1`
- `end_colon` is `bind - 2`

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `bind - 2`, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is `bind - 2`**
