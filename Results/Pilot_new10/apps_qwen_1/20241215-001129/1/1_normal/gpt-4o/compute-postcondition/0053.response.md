The code assigns the value of `i` to `end_colon`. Initially, `end_colon` is -1. After executing the line `end_colon = i`, the value of `end_colon` will be updated to the value of `i`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `bind`, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is `i`, the current value of `s[i]` is `:`**
