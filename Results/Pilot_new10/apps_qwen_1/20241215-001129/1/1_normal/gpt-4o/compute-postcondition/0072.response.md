Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is adjusted to start the loop correctly, `ind` is a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`. If `s[i]` is equal to '|', `pipe_count` is incremented by 1 (set to 1). Otherwise, the values of `total`, `i`, `ind`, `start_colon`, and `end_colon` remain unchanged.***
