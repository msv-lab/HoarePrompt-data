The `print(result)` statement outputs the value of `result` but does not change its value. Therefore, the only impact of this line of code is to print the current value of `result`.

Given the initial state:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is `end_colon`
- `ind` is a non-negative integer
- `start_colon` is `ind + 1`
- `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`
- `result` is `4 + pipe_count`, where `pipe_count` is the number of `'|'` characters in the substring `s[start_colon + 1:end_colon]`

The output state remains the same except that `result` is printed. The value of `result` is `4 + pipe_count`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `end_colon`, `ind` is a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`, `result` is `4 + pipe_count`, and `pipe_count` is the number of `'|'` characters in the substring `s[start_colon + 1:end_colon]` (result is printed)**
