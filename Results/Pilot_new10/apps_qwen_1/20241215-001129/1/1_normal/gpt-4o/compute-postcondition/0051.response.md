To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions under which the given `for` loop will run.

The loop is defined as follows:
```python
for i in range(bind - 1, ind, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range Function**: The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `bind - 1` and ending at `ind` (exclusive). The step is `-1`, meaning the loop will decrement `i` by 1 each time.

2. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to start, `bind - 1` must be greater than or equal to `ind`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `ind`.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `total` is 0 (this value does not affect the loop execution).
   - `i` is `bind`.
   - `ind` is a non-negative integer.
   - `bind` is a non-negative integer.
   - `start_colon` is either `ind + 1` (if a colon is found) or `-1` (if no colon is found).
   - `end_colon` is `-1`.

4. **Determining Adjustments**:
   - To start the loop, `bind - 1` must be greater than or equal to `ind`.
   - Since `i` starts at `bind`, and the loop decrements, `bind` must be greater than `ind` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `bind > ind`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `start_colon` and `end_colon` do not directly affect the loop but should be consistent with the logic of the program.
   - `ind` being a non-negative integer is already satisfied by the problem statement.

### Final State Adjustment:
Based on the above analysis, the state before the loop must ensure that the loop can execute, which means `bind` must be greater than `ind`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `bind`, `ind` is a non-negative integer, `bind` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than `ind`, `start_colon` is either `ind + 1` (if a colon is found) or `-1` (if no colon is found), `end_colon` is `-1`**.
