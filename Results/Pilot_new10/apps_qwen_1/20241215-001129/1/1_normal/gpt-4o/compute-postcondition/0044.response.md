Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `i_val + 1`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer. If `s[i]` equals `':'`, then `start_colon` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` does not equal `':'`, then `start_colon` remains unchanged.***
