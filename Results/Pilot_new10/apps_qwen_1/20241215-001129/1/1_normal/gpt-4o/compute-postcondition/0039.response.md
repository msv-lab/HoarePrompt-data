The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since no such loop or conditional statement is present in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is set to a value within the range `(ind + 1, bind)`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `i`, the current value of `s[i]` is ':' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
