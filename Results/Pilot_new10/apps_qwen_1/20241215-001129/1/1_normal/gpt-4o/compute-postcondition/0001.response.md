The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string input by the user, its length will be assigned to `n`. The length of `s` is a specific value depending on the input provided by the user.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`**
