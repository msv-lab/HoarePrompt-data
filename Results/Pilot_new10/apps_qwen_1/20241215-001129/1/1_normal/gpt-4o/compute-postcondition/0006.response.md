The code `break` does not affect any variable values. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given initial state, the `break` statement here simply indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or switch if we were inside one.

The output state remains the same as the initial state because no variables are modified by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is equal to `i`, the current value of `i` is within the bounds of the string `s` and the character at position `i` in `s` is '[', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
