The code `print(-1)` prints `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `total`, `i`, `ind`, `start_colon`, or `end_colon`. The only change is the print statement.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is -1, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`, `start_colon` is the index of the first colon found during the loop execution or -1 if no colon is found, `end_colon` is the index of the last colon found during the loop execution or -1 if no colon is found, and either `start_colon` is -1 or `end_colon` is -1 or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, and the console prints `-1`.**
