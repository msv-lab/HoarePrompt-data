To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to start:

1. **The loop starts with `i` ranging from `ind + 1` to `bind`**: This means `i` must be within the range defined by `ind + 1` to `bind`.
2. **`ind` and `bind` must be valid indices in the string `s`:** Both `ind` and `bind` must be non-negative integers and less than or equal to the length of `s`.

Given the initial states:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is -1
- `n` is the original length of `s`
- `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `[` in `s` (or -1 if `[` is not present)
- `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s` (or -1 if no `]` is present)
- `start_colon` is -1

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **`i` should be within the range (`ind + 1` to `bind`):**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be set to an initial value within this range. Since `i` is currently -1, it is not in the range. Thus, we need to adjust `i` to be in the range.

2. **`ind` and `bind` should be valid indices:**
   - Both `ind` and `bind` must be non-negative integers and within the bounds of the string `s`. The initial state indicates that both can be -1, meaning they may not be set yet or they could be invalid. Therefore, we need to ensure they are valid indices (i.e., non-negative).

3. **Initial values for `i` and `ind`/`bind`:**
   - If `ind` and `bind` are -1, the loop cannot execute as `i` would not be in the specified range. Hence, we need to ensure these indices are set correctly.

### Adjusted States:
- Ensure `i` is set to a value within the range `(ind + 1, bind)`.
- Ensure `ind` is a non-negative integer and valid (i.e., `ind >= 0`).
- Ensure `bind` is a non-negative integer and valid (i.e., `bind >= 0`).

Thus, the final states to be adjusted are:

**State: **`total` is 0, `i` must be set to a value within the range `(ind + 1, bind)`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is -1**

This ensures the loop condition `i in range(ind + 1, bind)` is satisfied.
