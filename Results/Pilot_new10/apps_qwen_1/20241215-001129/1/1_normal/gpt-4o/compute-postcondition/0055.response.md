Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `bind`, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is either `ind + 1` if a colon is found or remains `-1` if no colon is found, and the current value of `s[i]` is `:` if a colon is found, otherwise `end_colon` remains `-1`.***
