Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is `-1`, `bind` is the index of the `':'` if a match is found, otherwise `bind` is `-1`, and `ans` is the number of `|` characters encountered between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1` if the loop executed at least once, otherwise `ans` is `4`, `ind` is `-1`, and `bind` is `-1`.**
