The code assigns the value `False` to the variable `f`. The values of the other variables (`s`, `n`, and `ind`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`s` is the string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is -1, `f` is False**
