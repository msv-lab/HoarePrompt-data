`bind` is assigned the value of `i`. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, `bind` is simply assigned the value of `i`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an unspecified boolean value, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is the value of `i`.**
