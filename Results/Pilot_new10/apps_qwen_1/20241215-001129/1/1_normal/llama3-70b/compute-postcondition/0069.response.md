According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `ind + 1` to `bind - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` or `False` based on the conditions described, `ind` is a valid index within `s`, and `bind` is a valid index within `s` such that `bind > ind + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `bind`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last valid index processed, which means `i` is now equal to `bind - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to `bind`.

Let's summarize the new states:

- `s` remains a non-empty string.
- `n` remains the length of `s`.
- `f` remains `True` or `False` based on the conditions described.
- `ind` remains a valid index within `s`.
- `bind` remains a valid index within `s` such that `bind > ind + 1`.
- `i` is now `bind - 1` (the last valid index processed) and will be incremented to `bind` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is a valid index within `s`, `bind` is a valid index within `s` such that `bind > ind + 1`, and `i` is `bind`**.
