Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is a valid index within `s`, `bind` is a valid index within `s` such that `bind > ind + 1`, `i` is `bind`, `ans` is 1 if `s[i] == '|'`, and `ans` remains unchanged (still 1) if `s[i] != '|'`.***
