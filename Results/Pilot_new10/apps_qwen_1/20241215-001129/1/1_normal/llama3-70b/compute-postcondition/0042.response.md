Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `f` is `True`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is -1. If `s[i]` is `']'`, then `bind` is -1 and `f` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `bind` is equal to `i`, `s[i]` is set to `':'`, and `f` is set to `False`.***
