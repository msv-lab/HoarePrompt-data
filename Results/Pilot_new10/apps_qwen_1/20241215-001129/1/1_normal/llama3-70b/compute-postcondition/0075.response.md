Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is a valid index within `s` if the loop executed at least once, `bind` is a valid index within `s` such that `bind > ind + 1` if the loop executed at least once, `i` is `bind + 1` if the loop executed at least once, `ans` is the number of `|` characters encountered between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1` if the loop executed at least once, and if the loop does not execute, `ans` remains `4`, `ind` is `-1`, and `bind` is `-1`.**
