The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 4, so after executing `ans += 1`, the new value of `ans` is 5. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is not `-1` and is a valid index within `s`, `bind` is not `-1` and is a valid index within `s` such that `bind > ind + 1`, `ans` is 5, the current value of `i` is a valid index within `s` and the character at position `i` in `s` is `'|'**
