`f` is set to `False`. The value of `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `bind` remains unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `False`, `ind` is the index of the first ':' following a '[', otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is -1.
