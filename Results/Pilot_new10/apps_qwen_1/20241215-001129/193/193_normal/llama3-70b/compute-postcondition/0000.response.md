The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers before assigning them to `x` and `y`. Initially, `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`. After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the input, but the constraint `3 <= y < x <= 100,000` must still hold.

Since the exact input values are not specified, the output state will reflect the fact that `x` and `y` now hold the values entered by the user, while still maintaining the constraint `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000; `y` is an integer such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000**
