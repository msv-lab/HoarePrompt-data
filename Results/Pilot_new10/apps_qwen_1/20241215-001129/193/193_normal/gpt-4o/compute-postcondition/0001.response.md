The code calculates `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. Given that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`, the expression simplifies as follows:

1. `(x - y)` is an integer between 0 and 99,997.
2. `(x - y) // 2` is the integer division of `(x - y)` by 2.
3. `(x - y) % 2` is the remainder when `(x - y)` is divided by 2.

The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` essentially returns `(x - y)` itself because the integer division plus the remainder equals the original number.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to `x - y`.

Since the code only prints the value and does not assign it to a variable, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. However, the printed value is `x - y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000; `y` is an integer such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000; printed value is `x - y`**
