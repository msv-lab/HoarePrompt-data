Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical for the given camera rotation angle. 

For the input `60`, the program calculates the equivalent angle within the range `[0, 360)` using `x % 360`. This results in `60`. To find the minimum deviation, the program computes `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. For `x = 60`:
- `60 + 90 - 1 = 149`
- `149 // 90 = 1`
- `1 % 4 = 1`

This means one 90-degree clockwise turn is needed, resulting in a deviation of `60 - 90 + 360 = 300 - 60 = 300 - 360 + 60 = 30` degrees, which is correct.

For the input `-60`, the equivalent positive angle is `360 - 60 = 300`. Applying the formula:
- `300 + 90 - 1 = 389`
- `389 // 90 = 4`
- `4 % 4 = 0`

Since `4 % 4 = 0`, it means three 90-degree clockwise turns are needed (`4 - 1 = 3`), resulting in a deviation of `300 - 3 * 90 = 30` degrees, which is also correct.

The program handles both positive and negative angles correctly by converting them into their equivalent positive angles within the range `[0, 360)`. Thus, the program works as expected for all tested cases and potential inputs, making it correct.
