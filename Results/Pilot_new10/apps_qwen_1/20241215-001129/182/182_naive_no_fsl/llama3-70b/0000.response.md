Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical for both positive and negative rotation angles. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Handling of Input**: The program reads the input angle `x` and normalizes it using `x % 360`, ensuring that the angle is within the range `[0, 360)` degrees.
2. **Calculating Minimum Turns**:
   - For angles between `0` and `90` degrees (including `0` and `90`), no turns are needed.
   - For angles between `90` and `180` degrees, one 90-degree clockwise turn is needed.
   - For angles between `180` and `270` degrees, two 90-degree clockwise turns are needed.
   - For angles between `270` and `360` degrees, three 90-degree clockwise turns are needed.
   - This logic is implemented using `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, which correctly calculates the minimum number of turns for any input angle.

Given the examples and the logic, the program works correctly for all potential cases within the specified constraints.
