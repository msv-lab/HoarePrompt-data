The code `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` calculates the remainder when `(x + 90 - 1)` is divided by `90`, and then takes that result modulo `4`. Given the initial state where `x` is an integer in the range `0` to `359` (exclusive of `0`), let's analyze the expression:

1. Add `90 - 1` to `x`: This gives us `x + 89`.
2. Divide `x + 89` by `90`: Since `x` is in the range `0` to `359`, `x + 89` ranges from `89` to `448`. Dividing this range by `90` results in a quotient of `0` (since the smallest value is `89` and `89 / 90 < 1`) and the next integer up, which is `1` (since the largest value is `448` and `448 / 90 â‰ˆ 4.97`).
3. Take the result modulo `4`: The quotient from the division is `0` or `1`. Modulo `4` of `0` is `0`, and modulo `4` of `1` is `1`.

Therefore, regardless of the exact value of `x` within its given range, the expression evaluates to either `0` or `1`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range 0 to 359, and `x` is not equal to 0; print result is 0 or 1**
