Let's break down the annotated code step by step to determine the functionality of the function.

1. **Initial State**: The function starts with `x = int(input())`, which means `x` is an integer such that `-10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`.

2. **Modulo Operation**: `x = x % 360` ensures that `x` is within the range `[0, 359]`.

3. **Conditional Block**:
   - If `x == 0`, it prints `0`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `((x + 90 - 1) // 90) % 4`.

Now, let's analyze the potential cases:

- **Case 1**: If `x == 0`, the code prints `0`.
- **Case 2**: If `x` is between `1` and `359`, we need to evaluate the expression `((x + 90 - 1) // 90) % 4`:
  - For `x = 1` to `89`, the expression evaluates to `1`.
  - For `x = 90` to `179`, the expression evaluates to `2`.
  - For `x = 180` to `269`, the expression evaluates to `3`.
  - For `x = 270` to `359`, the expression evaluates to `0`.

Considering the range of `x` from `-10^18` to `10^18`, the modulo operation ensures `x` is in the range `[0, 359]`. However, the code only handles this specific range and does not explicitly handle values outside this range, although they would be reduced to this range due to the modulo operation.

Therefore, the function functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function takes an integer input `x` and reduces it modulo 360 to get a value in the range [0, 359]. If the reduced value is 0, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1, 2, 3, or 0 depending on the value of `x` in its reduced form.**
