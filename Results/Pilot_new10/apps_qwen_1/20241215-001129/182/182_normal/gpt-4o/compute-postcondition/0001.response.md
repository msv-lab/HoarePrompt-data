The code `normalized_angle = x % 360` calculates the remainder when `x` is divided by 360 and assigns it to `normalized_angle`. This operation ensures that `normalized_angle` is within the range [0, 360). The value of `x` is updated to this new value. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is `x % 360`, `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`**
