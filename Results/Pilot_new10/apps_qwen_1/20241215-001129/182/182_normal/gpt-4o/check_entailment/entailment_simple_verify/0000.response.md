Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align with the problem description. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical by normalizing the angle and then determining the appropriate number of turns. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at each step, confirming that the program logic is sound and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
