Final: **False**

Reason: Although the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical for most cases, there is a logical flaw in the calculation. Specifically, the formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` does not always yield the correct number of turns. This formula can fail when the angle is very close to a multiple of 90 degrees but not exactly on it. For example, if the input angle is 89 degrees (which is very close to 90 degrees), the normalized angle is 89, and the calculation would be `(360 - 89) // 90 % 4 = 2`, which is incorrect because 89 degrees is closer to requiring 1 turn rather than 2 turns. The correct approach should consider the closest multiple of 90 degrees in both directions and choose the one with the smaller deviation. Thus, the original assessment is not entirely accurate.
