Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins one friend needs to gift to satisfy all the given conditions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\).

2. **Calculating Minimum Coins per Friend**: It calculates the minimum number of coins (\(min\_x\)) one friend needs to gift using the formula \((L + M - 1) // M\). This ensures that the total number of unique coins gifted is at least \(L\) more than the number of friends \(M\).

3. **Checking Feasibility**: It checks if the product of \(M\) and \(min\_x\) is less than or equal to the difference between the total number of different coins \(N\) and the number of coins Ivan already has \(K\). If this condition is satisfied, it prints \(min\_x\). Otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

This logic correctly handles the constraints and conditions provided in the problem description. Given the problem's requirements and the examples provided, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases.
