Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if the total number of friends `M` is sufficient to provide `N - K + 1` different coins (since Ivan already has `K` coins out of `N` total types).
2. Additionally, it checks if `M` is sufficient to provide at least `L` new coins.
3. If both conditions are met, it prints `1` because one coin from each friend will ensure the conditions are satisfied.
4. If either condition fails, it prints `-1`.

This logic ensures that the program handles all described scenarios correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws in the implementation that would make the program incorrect based on the problem description.
