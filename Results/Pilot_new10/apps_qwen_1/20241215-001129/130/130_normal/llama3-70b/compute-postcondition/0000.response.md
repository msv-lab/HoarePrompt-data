The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. Since the exact input values are not specified, we know that `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` will be integers with the constraints provided. However, their specific values are not known yet.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers such that 1 <= `K` <= `N` <= 10^18, 1 <= `M`, `L` <= 10^18, and `M` * `L` >= `K`; the values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are determined by the input.**
