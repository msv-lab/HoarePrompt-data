Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) from standard input. This matches the problem requirement of reading these values from input.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Coins**:
   - The program calculates the minimum number of coins one friend can gift using the formula \((L + M - 1) // M\). This formula ensures that each friend gifts enough unique coins so that at least \(L\) of them are new in Ivan's collection.
   - The use of integer division \((L + M - 1) // M\) correctly handles the scenario where \(L + M - 1\) is not exactly divisible by \(M\).

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if \(M \times \text{min\_x} \le N - K\). This condition ensures that the total number of unique coins gifted by all friends is within the limit of \(N\) different types of coins and is sufficient to add at least \(L\) new coins to Ivan's collection.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints the calculated minimum number of coins. Otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when \(K > N\), in which case the condition \(M \times \text{min\_x} \le N - K\) will naturally fail, leading to \(-1\) being printed.

Given that the program correctly reads the input, performs the necessary calculations, and handles the conditions as specified in the problem description, the program is correct.
