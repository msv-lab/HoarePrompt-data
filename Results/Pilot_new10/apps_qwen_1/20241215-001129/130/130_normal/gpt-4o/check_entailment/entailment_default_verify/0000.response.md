Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is not entirely accurate because the program does not handle the case when \(K\) (the number of coins Ivan already has) exceeds \(N\) (the total number of different coins). According to the problem description, if \(K > N\), it should be impossible to satisfy the conditions since there are not enough unique coins to begin with. However, the program incorrectly proceeds with the calculation and prints \(-1\), which is not consistent with the problem statement. Specifically, the program should immediately return \(-1\) without performing any calculations if \(K > N\). This oversight means the program does not correctly reflect the constraints specified in the problem description.
