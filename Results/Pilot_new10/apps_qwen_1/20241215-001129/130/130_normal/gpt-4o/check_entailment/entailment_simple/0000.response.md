Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the solution to ensure it meets all the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) from the input using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - These values are then split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Coins per Friend**:
   - The variable `min_x` is calculated as \(\left\lceil \frac{L + M - 1}{M} \right\rceil\) using integer division (`//`). This ensures that even if there's a remainder, at least one more coin is included to meet the condition.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if \(M \times min_x \le N - K\). This condition ensures that the total number of new coins given by all friends is within the limit of available different coins minus the ones Ivan already has.
   - If the condition is satisfied, the program prints `min_x`.
   - If the condition is not satisfied, the program prints `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the total number of new coins required exceeds the number of available different coins after accounting for Ivan's existing collection.

Given these steps, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. It accounts for the constraints and ensures that the output is either the minimum number of coins or `-1` if it's not possible to meet the conditions.

Therefore, the program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases.
