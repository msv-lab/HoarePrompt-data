The code assigns the value of `(L + M - 1) // M` to the variable `min_x`. This means `min_x` is the ceiling division of `(L + M - 1)` by `M`. The values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers assigned values from input, such that $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$, $1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}$, and $M \times (\text{minimum number of coins one friend can gift}) \ge L$; `min_x` is `(L + M - 1) // M`.**
