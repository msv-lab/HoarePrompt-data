Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `N` (the total number of different coins) is smaller than `K + L`. In such a case, it is impossible to satisfy the condition that at least `L` coins must be new in Ivan's collection because Ivan already has `K` coins out of the `N` available coins. However, the current implementation does not check this condition, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

For example, consider the following input:

Input
```
10 11 2 4
```

In this case, `N` is 10, `K` is 2, and `L` is 4. It is impossible to give 4 new coins because there are only 8 coins left after accounting for the 2 coins Ivan already has. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`, but the program incorrectly outputs `1`.

To fix this, you need to add a condition to check if `N` is less than `K + L` before calculating the minimum number of coins.
