`s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it now holds the string entered by the user. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the input operation only affects `s`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `s` and retains the initial condition for `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is the string entered by the user**
