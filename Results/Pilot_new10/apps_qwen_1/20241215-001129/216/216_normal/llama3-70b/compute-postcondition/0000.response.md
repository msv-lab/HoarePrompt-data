The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `n` and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 200`, the input value should also fall within this range. However, the actual value of `n` depends on user input, which is not specified here. The variable `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 200` (depending on user input), `s` is a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters**
