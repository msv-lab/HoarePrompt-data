Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program only collects the indices of lowercase letters and prints their count without checking for the presence of uppercase letters between any two selected lowercase letters. This violates the requirement specified in the problem description, which states that there should be no uppercase letters between the chosen positions. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct result for cases where uppercase letters are present between selected lowercase letters, as demonstrated by the examples provided in the problem description.
