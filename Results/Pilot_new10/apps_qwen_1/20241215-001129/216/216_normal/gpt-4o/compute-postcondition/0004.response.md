The code initializes `current_count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `max_count`, or `current_set`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `current_count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, inclusive; `s` is a string entered by the user; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` is an empty set; `current_count` is 0**
