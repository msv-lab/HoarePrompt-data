The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the length of the string `s` which will be read in the next line. The initial state specifies that `n` is a single integer between 1 and 200, and `s` is a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. After executing the code snippet, the value of `n` is set to the integer input, while the string `s` has not yet been read.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is undefined**
