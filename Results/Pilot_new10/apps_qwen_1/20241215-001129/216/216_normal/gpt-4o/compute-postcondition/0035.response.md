The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of the string `s`, and the second line contains a string `s` consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Based on the provided input, the function does not return any specific value as per the given information.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` followed by a string `s` as input, where `n` represents the length of `s`, and `s` consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, but does not return any value.**
