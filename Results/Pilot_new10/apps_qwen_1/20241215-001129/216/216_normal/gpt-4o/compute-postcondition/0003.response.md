The code creates a new empty set called `current_set`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, or `max_count`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `current_set`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, inclusive; `s` is a string entered by the user; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` is an empty set**
