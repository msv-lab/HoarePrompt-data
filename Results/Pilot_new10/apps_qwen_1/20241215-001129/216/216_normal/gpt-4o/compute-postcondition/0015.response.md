Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set that either contains the current character (if the character is not already in `current_set`) with `current_count` incremented to 1, or remains unchanged, the current character processed is either a lowercase letter or not a lowercase letter.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts of the if-else block, ensuring that the state of the program variables (`n`, `s`, `max_count`, `current_set`, and `current_count`) is accurately described based on whether the character being processed is a lowercase letter or not.
