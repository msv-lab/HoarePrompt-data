Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the set of positions containing lowercase letters is "pretty" according to the given definition. The code simply counts the maximum number of consecutive lowercase letters without considering the presence of uppercase letters between them.

For example, consider the input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```

The correct output should be 2, as the largest pretty set of positions could be {6, 8} or {7, 8}, where the letters 'a' at positions 6 and 7 or 7 and 8 are distinct and there are no uppercase letters between them.

However, the provided code would not handle this case correctly because it only counts consecutive lowercase letters without checking for the presence of uppercase letters between them. This results in an incorrect solution that does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
