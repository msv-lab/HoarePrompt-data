The function reads an integer `n` followed by a string `s` as input, where `n` represents the length of `s`, and `s` consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. The function then iterates through each character in `s` and keeps track of the maximum count of consecutive lowercase characters. If an uppercase character is encountered, the current count of consecutive lowercase characters is reset. Finally, the function prints the maximum count of consecutive lowercase characters found in `s`.
