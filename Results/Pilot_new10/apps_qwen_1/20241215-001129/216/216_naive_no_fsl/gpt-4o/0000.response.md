Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between the positions of the lowercase letters in the pretty set. This can be demonstrated with the following test case:

Input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output (from the provided program):
```
1
```

The program fails to consider the constraint that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected lowercase letters. In the input string "aaaaBaabAbA", the program only counts the first 'a' before the uppercase 'B', but it should also count the second 'a' after the uppercase 'B', resulting in a pretty set of size 2. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for this specific case.
