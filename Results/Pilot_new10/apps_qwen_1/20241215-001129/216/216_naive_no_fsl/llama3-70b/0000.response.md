Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not consider the requirement that there should be no uppercase letters between the chosen positions. The program simply collects all the indices of lowercase letters and prints their count. This logic fails to check for the presence of uppercase letters between any two selected lowercase letters, which is a critical part of the problem description. For instance, in the input "aaaaBaabAbA", the program would incorrectly return 5 instead of 2, as it does not enforce the constraint about no uppercase letters between selected positions.
