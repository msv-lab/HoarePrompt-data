Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not consider the requirement that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected positions. This can be seen in the following example:

Consider the input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```
The program will output `2` because it only checks for lowercase letters, but the correct answer should be `2` for the positions 6 and 8 or 7 and 8, as explained in the problem description. However, the program does not ensure that there are no uppercase letters between these positions.

To fix this, the program needs to check for uppercase letters between the selected positions and adjust the selection accordingly.
