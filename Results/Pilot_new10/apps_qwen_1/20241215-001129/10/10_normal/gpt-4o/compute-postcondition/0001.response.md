The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which represent the dimensions of the grid. These values are assigned to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `d` is an integer input by the user, and there are `d` lines containing coordinates of sofas. However, the code does not interact with `d` or the subsequent lines of input in this snippet.

The impact of the code on the program is that it assigns the first two integers from the input to `n` and `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is the integer input by the user, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user**
