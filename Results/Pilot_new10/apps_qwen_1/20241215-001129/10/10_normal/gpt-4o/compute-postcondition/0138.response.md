The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this scenario, there is no loop present, so the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the conditions and values from the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is less than `d`, `d` is greater than 0, `j` equals `i + 2`, `x1` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x2` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x1_j` equals `sofas[j][0]`, `y1_j` equals `sofas[j][1]`, `x2_j` equals `sofas[j][2]`, `y2_j` equals `sofas[j][3]`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if the condition `(y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j)` is met, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if the condition `y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j` is met, `right_count[i]` remains unchanged unless the condition `x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j` is true, `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.**
