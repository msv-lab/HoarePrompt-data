Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `d`, `d` is greater than 0, `j` equals `i + 2`, `x1` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x2` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if the condition `(y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j)` is met, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if the condition `y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j` is met, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.***

Explanation:
- The if condition checks if `x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j`.
- If the condition is true, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.
- Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition includes the changes made in the if part, along with the conditions specified in the if part's postcondition.
