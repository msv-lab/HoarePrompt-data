The code initializes a list `left_count` with `d` zeros. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `left_count` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0; `n` is the first integer input by the user; `m` is the second integer input by the user; `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are integers input by the user; `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros.**
