Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `d` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `d - 1`.
- `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples.
- For each `j` from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the respective elements of `sofas[j]`.
- `right_count[i]` is the count of `j` such that `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`.
- `left_count[i]` is the count of `j` such that `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`.
- `bottom_count[i]` is the count of `j` such that `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`.
- `top_count[i]` is the count of `j` such that `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(d):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `d - 1`.

2. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition `i in range(d)` means `i` should be from `0` to `d-1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `d`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is `d - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `i` by 1 makes `i` equal to `d`.
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is within the range `0` to `d-1`, which means `i` must be `0` for the next iteration.

### Updated States for the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `d` remains the same (an integer greater than 0).
- `i` is now `0`.
- `sofas` still contains exactly `d` tuples.
- For each `j` from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the respective elements of `sofas[j]`.
- `right_count[0]` will be updated during the loop execution.
- `left_count[0]` will be updated during the loop execution.
- `bottom_count[0]` will be updated during the loop execution.
- `top_count[0]` will be updated during the loop execution.

### Final Answer:
State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples, for each `j` from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the respective elements of `sofas[j]`, `right_count[0]` is the count of `j` such that `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, `left_count[0]` is the count of `j` such that `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, `bottom_count[0]` is the count of `j` such that `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, `top_count[0]` is the count of `j` such that `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`.**
