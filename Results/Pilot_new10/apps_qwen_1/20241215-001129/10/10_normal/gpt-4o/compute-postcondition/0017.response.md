The code initializes a new list `bottom_count` with `d` zeros. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `bottom_count`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0; `n` is the first integer input by the user; `m` is the second integer input by the user; `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are integers input by the user; `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros; `right_count` is a list of `d` zeros; `top_count` is a list of `d` zeros; `bottom_count` is a list of `d` zeros.**
