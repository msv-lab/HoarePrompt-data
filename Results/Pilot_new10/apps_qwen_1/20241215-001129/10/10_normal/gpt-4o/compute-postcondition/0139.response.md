Postcondition: **`i` is less than `d`, `d` is greater than 0, `j` equals `i + 2`, `x1` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x2` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x1_j` equals `sofas[j][0]`, `y1_j` equals `sofas[j][1]`, `x2_j` equals `sofas[j][2]`, `y2_j` equals `sofas[j][3]`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if the condition `(y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j)` is met, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if the condition `y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j` is met, `right_count[i]` remains unchanged unless the condition `x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j` is true, `left_count[i]` remains unchanged. Since the condition `i == j` is checked and it is false (as `j = i + 2`), none of the count variables (`bottom_count`, `top_count`, `right_count`, `left_count`) change.**
