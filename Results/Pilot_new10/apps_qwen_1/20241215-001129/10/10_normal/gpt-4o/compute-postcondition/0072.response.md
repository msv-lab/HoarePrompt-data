Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from the first tuple in the `sofas` list. `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`.***

This postcondition retains all the information from the precondition and includes the condition from the if statement, indicating the updated relationship between the variables after entering the if condition.
