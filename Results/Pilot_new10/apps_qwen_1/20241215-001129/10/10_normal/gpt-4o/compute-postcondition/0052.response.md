The code assigns the values from `sofas[j]` to `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Given that `j` is 2, the values assigned will be `x1_2`, `y1_2`, `x2_2`, and `y2_2`. Since `i` is 0 and does not equal `j` (which is 2), the values of `y1_j` and `y2_j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are updated to `sofas[2]`'s elements, and the other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` contains exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is `x1_2`, `y1_j` is `y1_2`, `x2_j` is `x2_2`, `y2_j` is `y2_2`**
