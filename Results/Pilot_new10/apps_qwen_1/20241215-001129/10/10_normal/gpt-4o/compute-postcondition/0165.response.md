Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples, for each `j` from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the respective elements of `sofas[j]`, `right_count[0]` is the count of `j` such that `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, `left_count[0]` is the count of `j` such that `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, `top_count[0]` is the count of `j` such that `y1 < y2_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, `bottom_count[0]` is the count of `j` such that `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`. If the conditions `(left_count[0] == cnt_l and right_count[0] == cnt_r and top_count[0] == cnt_t and bottom_count[0] == cnt_b)` are met, then `target_sofa` is `d + 1` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `target_sofa` remains `-1`.**
