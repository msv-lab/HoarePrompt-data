Postcondition: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, `top_count[0]` is incremented by 1 if `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j` otherwise `top_count[0]` remains unchanged, `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1, `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1 if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, otherwise `right_count[0]` remains unchanged, `bottom_count[0]` remains unchanged.**
