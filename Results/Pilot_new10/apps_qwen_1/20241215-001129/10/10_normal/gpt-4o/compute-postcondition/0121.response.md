Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `d`, `d` is greater than 0, `j` equals `i`, `x1` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x2` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x1_j` equals `sofas[i][0]`, `y1_j` equals `sofas[i][1]`, `x2_j` equals `sofas[i][2]`, `y2_j` equals `sofas[i][3]`, and `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The overall state of the program remains unchanged unless the condition `(y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j)` is met, in which case the state is such that `bottom_count[i]` is further incremented by 1.***
