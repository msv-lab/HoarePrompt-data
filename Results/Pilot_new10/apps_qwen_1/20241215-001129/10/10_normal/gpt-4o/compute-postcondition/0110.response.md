The `continue` statement in a loop causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and move to the next iteration without executing any statements after it. Since there is no loop context given, the state of the variables remains unchanged after encountering the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`i` is less than `d`, `d` is greater than 0, `j` equals `i`.**
