The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the variables `d`, `i`, `sofas`, `j`, `x1_2`, `y1_2`, `x2_2`, `y2_2`, `y1_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` contains exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 2, `x1_2` is the first element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_2` is the second element of `sofas[2]`, `x2_2` is the third element of `sofas[2]`, `y2_2` is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is `y1_2`, `y2_j` is `y2_2`.**
