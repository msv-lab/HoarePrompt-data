The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, but rather indicates that the loop will continue its execution from the beginning of the next iteration. The current values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 0, and the current value of `i` is equal to the current value of `j`**
