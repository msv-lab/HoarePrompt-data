Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 1, `x1_1` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_1` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_1` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, `y2_1` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_j` is `y1_1`, `y2_j` is `y2_1`. If `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, then `bottom_count[0]` is 1 more than its original value. Otherwise, `bottom_count[0]` remains unchanged.***
