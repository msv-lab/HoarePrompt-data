The code `x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())` reads four integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The previous values of these variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) are replaced by the new input values.

The initial state is:
- `d` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is the first integer input by the user.
- `m` is the second integer input by the user.
- `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (the third integer input by the user, the fourth integer input by the user, the fifth integer input by the user, the sixth integer input by the user) and an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.
- `x1` is the third integer input by the user.
- `y1` is the fourth integer input by the user.
- `x2` is the fifth integer input by the user.
- `y2` is the sixth integer input by the user.

After executing the code, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are updated with the new input values. The values of `d`, `n`, `m`, and the `sofas` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (the third integer input by the user, the fourth integer input by the user, the fifth integer input by the user, the sixth integer input by the user) and an additional tuple with new values for `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**, where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are the new integers input by the user.
