`x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from the tuple `sofas[j]`. The value of `j` is 0, so these variables are assigned the values from the first tuple in the `sofas` list. However, the specific values within the tuple are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. The variables `d`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `j`, and both `i` and `j` are 0; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from the first tuple in the `sofas` list.**
