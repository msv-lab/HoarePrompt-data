The code initializes an empty list `sofas`. This does not affect the values of `d`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`d` is the integer input by the user, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user; `sofas` is an empty list**
