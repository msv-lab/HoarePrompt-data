Functionality: **The function processes input data including an integer \(d\), two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and \(d\) lines of coordinates for sofas. It then constructs lists to count the number of sofas that are to the right, left, above, and below each sofa. Finally, it searches for a sofa whose counts match the given \(cnt_{l}\), \(cnt_{r}\), \(cnt_{t}\), and \(cnt_{b}\) values and prints the index of this sofa (1-indexed) if found, otherwise it prints \(-1**.
