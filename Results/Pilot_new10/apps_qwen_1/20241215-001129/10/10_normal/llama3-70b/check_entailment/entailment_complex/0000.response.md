Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down why it meets all the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of sofas `d`, the dimensions of the storehouse `n` and `m`, the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa by iterating over all other sofas and counting the appropriate conditions.
   - The function correctly checks if the current sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of the given sofa by comparing their coordinates.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main part of the program iterates over each sofa and uses `func_1` to get the counts of sofas in each direction.
   - It compares these counts with the given `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`. If they match, it prints the index of the sofa plus one and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no sofa matches the conditions, it prints `-1`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Coordinate Comparison:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the relative position of one sofa with respect to another by checking if the x-coordinates and y-coordinates meet the conditions for being to the left, right, top, or bottom.

2. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The program handles boundary conditions correctly since it only increments the counts if the conditions are strictly met (e.g., `x1 < x2` for the left condition).

3. **Multiple Conditions:**
   - The program checks all four conditions simultaneously and ensures that the counts match exactly.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The program iterates over each sofa once to calculate the counts, ensuring an efficient solution within the constraints.

Since the program correctly parses the input, implements the required functionality through the function `func_1`, and checks all conditions accurately, it meets the problem description for all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
