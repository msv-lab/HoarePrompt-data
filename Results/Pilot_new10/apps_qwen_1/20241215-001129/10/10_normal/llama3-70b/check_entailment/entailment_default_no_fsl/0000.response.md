Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the specified sofa is on the boundary or edge of the storehouse correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the specified sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of another sofa by comparing the coordinates directly. This approach fails when the specified sofa is on the boundary because it does not account for the possibility that there might not be any sofas in certain directions due to the boundary constraints.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
3 3
1 1 1 2
2 1 2 2
1 1 0 0 1 1
```

In this case, the first sofa (1, 1) to (1, 2) has 1 sofa to the left (itself, but not counted), 0 sofas to the right, 1 sofa to the top, and 1 sofa to the bottom. The second sofa (2, 1) to (2, 2) has 1 sofa to the left, 0 sofas to the right, 1 sofa to the top, and 0 sofas to the bottom. 

The code will count the number of sofas in each direction correctly for the first sofa, but it will fail for the second sofa because it does not properly account for the boundary condition where there are no sofas to the left or to the right of the second sofa.

To fix this, the function `func_1` needs to check if the specified sofa is on the boundary before counting the number of sofas in certain directions. For example, if the specified sofa is on the leftmost column, it should not count any sofas to the left. Similarly, if it is on the topmost row, it should not count any sofas above it.
