To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop and their initial states.

1. **`s`**: The loop variable `s` will iterate over each element in the `sofas` list. For the loop to start, `sofas` must contain at least one element. Since each element in `sofas` represents a sofa's coordinates, we need to ensure that `sofas` has at least one such list.

2. **`sofa`**: The variable `sofa` is used within the loop body but is initialized to a specific list from `sofas`. We don't need to change its state explicitly here since the loop will access elements of `sofa` as it iterates through `sofas`.

3. **`n` and `m`**: These represent the dimensions of the storehouse. While these dimensions are necessary for the problem context, they do not directly affect whether the loop can execute.

4. **`d`**: This is the number of sofas in the storehouse, and it should match the length of the `sofas` list.

5. **`left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`**: These variables are initialized to 0. They might be updated during the loop, but their initial values do not affect whether the loop can execute.

Given this analysis, the key state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `sofas` contains at least one list representing a sofa's coordinates.

State: **`sofas` must contain at least one list of coordinates, `sofa` is an element of `sofas`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the storehouse, `d` is the number of sofas in the storehouse, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0**
