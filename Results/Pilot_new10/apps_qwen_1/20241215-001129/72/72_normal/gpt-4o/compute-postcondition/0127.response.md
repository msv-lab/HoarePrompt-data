The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `direction`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the `remaining_questions`, `m`, `col`, `max_questions`, and `row` retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` â‰¥ 1, `col` is 0, `max_questions` has been increased by 1, `row` equals `n`, `direction` is -1**
