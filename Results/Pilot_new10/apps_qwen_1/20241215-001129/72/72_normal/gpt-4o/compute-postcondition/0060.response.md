`row` is decremented by 2. Since `x - 1` is the initial value of `row`, the new value of `row` will be `(x - 1) - 2` which simplifies to `x - 3`. The conditions for `sergei_questions` remain unchanged since `x - 1 == x and y == y` is false (as `x - 1` cannot be equal to `x`). Therefore, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`row` is `x - 3`, `col` is `y`, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
