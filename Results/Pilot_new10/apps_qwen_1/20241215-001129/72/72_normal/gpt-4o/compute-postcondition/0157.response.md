The variable `direction` is assigned the value `-1`. This changes the value of `direction` but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` > 1, `m` ≥ 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `row` is increased by `-1`.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` ≥ 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `row` is increased by `-1`**
