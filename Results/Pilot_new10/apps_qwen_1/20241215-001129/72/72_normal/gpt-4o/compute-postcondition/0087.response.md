Postcondition: ***`col` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `max_questions` is the number of times `row` reaches `n-1` plus the number of times `row == x and col == y` is true during the iterations minus 1, `sergei_questions` is the number of times `row == x and col == y` is true during the iterations where `direction == 1` plus 1 (if the condition `row == x and col == y` is met), `remaining_questions` is 1, and `row` is either incremented by `direction` to a new value or is set to 1, depending on whether `row == -1` is true or false.***
