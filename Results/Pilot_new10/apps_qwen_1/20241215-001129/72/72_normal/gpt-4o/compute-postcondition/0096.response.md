Postcondition: ***`row` is equal to `x + direction`, `col` is equal to `y`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `x + direction == x` and `y == y` was true, otherwise it remains unchanged; `max_questions` is increased by 1. If `row == n`, then `row` is set to `x - 3`; otherwise, `row` remains as `x + direction`. `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` maintain their respective conditions from the precondition and the if part.***
