Postcondition: ***`row` is equal to `x + direction`. If `row == n` is true, then `row` is `x - 3`, `col` is `y`, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `row` is `x + direction`, `col` is `y`, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x and col == y` is true, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.***
