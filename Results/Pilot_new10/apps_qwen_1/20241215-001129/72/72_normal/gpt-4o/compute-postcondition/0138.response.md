To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions given in the problem and how they apply to the `col` variable.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `remaining_questions` > 1
- `m` ≥ 1
- `col` is 0

The for loop iterates over `col` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `col` is 0.

2. **First Iteration (col = 0):**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the conditions provided, no specific changes are mentioned for `col = 0`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations (col > 0):**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider what happens as `col` increments from 0 to `m-1`.

Since the loop is iterating over `col` starting from 0 and increasing it until it reaches `m-1`, the only change to `col` in each iteration is its increment by 1. Therefore, the key point is whether the loop can continue to the next iteration by incrementing `col` from 0 to 1.

Based on this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `col` itself, which will be incremented from 0 to 1 for the next iteration.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `col` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

### Updated State:
State: **`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` ≥ 1, and `col` is 1**
