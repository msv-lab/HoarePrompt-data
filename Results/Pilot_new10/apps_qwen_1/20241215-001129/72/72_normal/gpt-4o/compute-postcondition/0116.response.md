Postcondition: ***`sergei_questions` and `max_questions` maintain their original conditions unless the following conditions are met: 
- If `direction == 1` and `row == x` and `col == y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `col` is incremented by 1, and `row` is incremented by `direction`. If `row == n`, `row` remains `r - 3` and `col` is unchanged. 
- Otherwise, if `row == x` and `col == y`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `row` is decremented by 1, and `max_questions` is decremented by 1. 
In summary, if `direction == 1`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 when `row == x` and `col == y`, `col` is incremented by 1, and `row` is incremented by `direction` (unless `row == n`, in which case `row` remains `r - 3`). If the conditions do not match, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `row` is decremented by 1, and `max_questions` is decremented by 1.***
