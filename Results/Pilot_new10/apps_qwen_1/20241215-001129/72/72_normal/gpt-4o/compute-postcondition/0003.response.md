`full_cycle_length` is assigned the value `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1`, otherwise it is assigned the value `m`. Since `n` is an integer, the value of `n` determines whether the first condition is met. The values of `m`, `k`, `y`, and `x` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `y` is one less than its original value, `x` is one less than its original value, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `m`**
