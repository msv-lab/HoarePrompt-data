Postcondition: **`m` must be at least 1, the current value of `row` is `x` + 1, the current value of `col` is `y`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x and col == y` is true, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `max_questions` is incremented by 1. If `row == n`, then `direction` is `-1`; otherwise, the direction remains unchanged.**
