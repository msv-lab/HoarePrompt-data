Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `row` and `col` are coordinates, `max_questions` and `sergei_questions` are counters, and `col` is `col_end + 1`. If `direction == 1` and `row == n`, then `direction` is set to -1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `direction == 1`, `row` is incremented by `direction`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. If `row == -1`, `row` remains unchanged; otherwise, `row` is incremented by `direction`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.***
