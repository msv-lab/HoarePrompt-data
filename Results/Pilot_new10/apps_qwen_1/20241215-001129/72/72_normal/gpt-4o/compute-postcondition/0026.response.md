`max_questions` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`m`, `row`, `col`, `sergei_questions`, and `direction`) remain unchanged. The condition `row == x and col == y` does not affect the increment of `max_questions`.

Output State: **`m` must be at least 1, the current value of `row` is `x`, and the current value of `col` is `y`. The direction is set to 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x and col == y` is true, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `max_questions` is incremented by 1.**
