`row` is increased by 2. Previously, `row` was equal to `x + 1`. After the increment, `row` becomes `(x + 1) + 2`, which simplifies to `x + 3`. The values of `max_questions`, `col`, and `sergei_questions` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is equal to `x + 3`, `col` is equal to `y`, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
