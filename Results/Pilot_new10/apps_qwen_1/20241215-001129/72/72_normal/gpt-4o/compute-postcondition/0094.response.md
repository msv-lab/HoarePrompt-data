The code changes the value of `direction` to `-1`. The values of `row`, `col`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions` are not directly affected by this assignment. However, since `sergei_questions` was incremented by 1 under the condition that `x + direction == x and y == y` was true, and this condition is now false (since `x + direction != x` when `direction` is `-1`), `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. The value of `max_questions` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`row` is equal to `x + -1`, `col` is equal to `y`, `sergei_questions` is unchanged, `max_questions` is increased by 1**
