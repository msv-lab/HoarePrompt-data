Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` â‰¥ 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and the condition for increasing `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `row` is 4.***

This postcondition is derived from the fact that the if part sets `row` to 4 regardless of the condition `row == -1` because there is no else part to change this state. Therefore, the overall postcondition retains the initial conditions and updates `row` to 4 as specified in the if part.
