Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` ≥ 1, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` equals `n - 2` (if `row == n` is true), and `direction` is -1. If `row == n` is false, the original conditions hold: `remaining_questions` > 1, `m` ≥ 1, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `row` is increased by `direction`.***
