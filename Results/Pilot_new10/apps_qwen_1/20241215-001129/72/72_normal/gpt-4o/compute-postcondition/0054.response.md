Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `m` is at least 1.
   - `row` and `col` are coordinates.
   - `max_questions` and `sergei_questions` are counters.
   - `col` is `col_end + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `col` from 0 to `m-1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know the following:
     - If `direction == 1` and `row == n`, then `direction` is set to -1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.
     - If `direction == 1`, `row` is incremented by `direction`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.
     - If `row == -1`, `row` remains unchanged; otherwise, `row` is incremented by `direction`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `col` is `col_end + 1`.
   - This means the loop has already incremented `col` once and is now starting the first iteration where `col` is 0.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `col` will be 0.
   - We need to determine the new values of `row`, `max_questions`, and `sergei_questions` based on the conditions given.

Given the conditions:
- Since `col` is `col_end + 1`, it implies that the loop has just started, and `col` is at its initial value (0).
- The loop will continue as long as `col` is less than `m`.

Since no specific changes to `row`, `max_questions`, or `sergei_questions` are mentioned directly related to the increment of `col` alone, these values remain unchanged from the previous state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `col` will be 0.
- `row` and `max_questions` remain unchanged from the previous state.
- `sergei_questions` remains unchanged from the previous state.

**State:**
**`m` is at least 1, `row` and `col` are coordinates, `max_questions` and `sergei_questions` are counters, and `col` is 0.**
