The variable `direction` is assigned the value `-1`. This does not affect the values of `m`, `row`, `col`, `sergei_questions`, or `max_questions`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `direction`.

Output State: **`m` must be at least 1, the current value of `row` is equal to `n`, the current value of `col` is `y`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x and col == y` is true, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `max_questions` is incremented by 1; `direction` is `-1`.**
