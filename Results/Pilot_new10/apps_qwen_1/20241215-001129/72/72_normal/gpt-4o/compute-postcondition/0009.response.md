The code assigns `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)` to `min_questions`. Given that `full_cycles` is `k // full_cycle_length` and `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, we can simplify `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)` as follows:

- `full_cycles = k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`
- `min_questions = (k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)) // (2 * n - 2)`

Since integer division in Python truncates the decimal part, `min_questions` will be the integer part of the division of `full_cycles` by `(2 * n - 2)`. 

The other variables (`m`, `k`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `max_questions`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)) // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is `full_cycles`**
