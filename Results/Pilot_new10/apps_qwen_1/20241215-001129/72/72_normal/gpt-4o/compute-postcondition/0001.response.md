`x` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces; `x` is one less than its original value.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces; `x` is one less than its original value**
