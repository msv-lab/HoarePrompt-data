The code `row -= 2` decrements the value of `row` by 2. Given the initial state where `row` equals `n`, this means `row` will now be `n - 2`. The other variables (`remaining_questions`, `m`, `col`, `max_questions`, and `direction`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` â‰¥ 1, `col` is 0, `max_questions` has been increased by 1, `row` equals `n - 2`, `direction` is -1**
