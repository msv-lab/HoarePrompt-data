The code simply prints the values of `max_questions`, `min_questions`, and `sergei_questions`. Since the actual values of these variables are not changed by the print statement, their values remain the same. Therefore, the only change in the output state is that the values of these three variables are printed.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is 0, `m` is the number of columns, `col` is `m`, `max_questions` is the sum of all increments minus all decrements, `sergei_questions` is incremented based on the condition `row == x and col == y`, `row` is the final value of `row`, `direction` is the final value of `direction`, and the values of `max_questions`, `min_questions`, and `sergei_questions` are printed.**
