Postcondition: ***`sergei_questions` and `max_questions` maintain their conditions from the precondition and the if part. If `direction == 1` and `row == x`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 and `max_questions` is increased by 1. Additionally, `row` is set to `x + 1` and `max_questions` is increased by 1 if `row == n`, otherwise `row` remains as `x + 1`. If `direction != 1`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 and `row` is either `x + 3` or `-1`, while `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.***

This summary captures all the conditions and changes in the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, adhering to the provided format.
