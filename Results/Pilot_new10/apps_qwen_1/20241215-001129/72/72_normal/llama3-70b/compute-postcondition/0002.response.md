First, let's determine the value of `max_asked`. Given the initial state, `max_asked` is calculated as:

\[ \text{max\_asked} = \left(\frac{k + (n - 1)}{2 \times n}\right) \]

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are not specified, we will keep them as they are in the calculation.

Next, we execute the line of code:

\[ \text{min\_asked} = \max(1, \text{max\_asked} - (n - 1)) \]

This line updates `min_asked` to be the maximum of 1 and the value of `max_asked` minus `n - 1`.

To determine the exact value of `min_asked`, we need to consider two cases:

1. If \(\text{max\_asked} - (n - 1) \geq 1\), then \(\text{min\_asked} = \text{max\_asked} - (n - 1)\).
2. If \(\text{max\_asked} - (n - 1) < 1\), then \(\text{min\_asked} = 1\).

Let's express `min_asked` in terms of the given variables:

\[ \text{min\_asked} = \max\left(1, \left(\frac{k + (n - 1)}{2 \times n}\right) - (n - 1)\right) \]
\[ \text{min\_asked} = \max\left(1, \frac{k + (n - 1) - 2n(n - 1)}{2n}\right) \]
\[ \text{min\_asked} = \max\left(1, \frac{k + (n - 1) - 2n^2 + 2n}{2n}\right) \]
\[ \text{min\_asked} = \max\left(1, \frac{k - 2n^2 + 3n - 1}{2n}\right) \]

Since we don't have specific values for `k`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `y`, we cannot simplify this further without knowing their exact values. However, we know that `min_asked` will be the maximum of 1 and the value derived from the above expression.

The output state includes the updated value of `min_asked` and retains the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, and `max_asked`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer; `max_asked` is \(\left(\frac{k + (n - 1)}{2 \times n}\right)\); `min_asked` is \(\max\left(1, \frac{k - 2n^2 + 3n - 1}{2n}\right)\).**
