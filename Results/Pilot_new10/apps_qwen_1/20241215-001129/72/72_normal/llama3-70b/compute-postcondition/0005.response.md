The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` with specific constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m) and return a value based on certain conditions. However, since no specific behavior or return values are provided in the problem statement, we can only state the constraints and the fact that the function should process these variables.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but processes integers n, m, k, x, and y with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m.**
