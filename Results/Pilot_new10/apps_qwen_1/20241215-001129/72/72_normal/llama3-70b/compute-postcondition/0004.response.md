The code prints the values of `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked`. However, since these values are printed and not reassigned to any variable, their values remain unchanged in the state after the code execution. Therefore, the output of the print statement does not affect the state of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer; `max_asked` is \(\left(\frac{k + (n - 1)}{2 \times n}\right)\); `min_asked` is \(\max\left(1, \frac{k - 2n^2 + 3n - 1}{2n}\right)\); `sergei_asked` is \(q + 1\) if \(r \geq n - x + 1\) else \(q\), where \(q = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n)\) and \(r = (k + x - 1) \% (2 * n)\). The values of `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` are printed.**
