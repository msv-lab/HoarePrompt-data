The code sets `max_asked` to the value of `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are unchanged. The output state includes the updated value of `max_asked`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer; `max_asked` is `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`**
