You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the total number of questions `k` is less than the number of pupils in a full cycle, which is `2 * n * m`. Specifically, the program calculates the number of times Sergei is asked using the formula `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`, which may lead to incorrect results when `k` is less than `2 * n * m`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 10 5 1 1
```
According to the problem description, the order of asking pupils is as follows:
1. The first row's first pupil (Sergei).

Since `k = 5` and `2 * n * m = 20`, the teacher will only ask the first row's first pupil 3 times within the first 5 questions. However, the program calculates the number of times Sergei is asked as:
```
sergei_asked = (5 + 1 - 1) // (2 * 1) + ((5 + 1 - 1) % (2 * 1) >= 1 - 1) = 3 + 0 = 3
```
This calculation is correct for this specific input. However, consider another input:
```
1 10 2 1 1
```
In this case, the teacher asks the first row's first pupil only twice. The program calculates the number of times Sergei is asked as:
```
sergei_asked = (2 + 1 - 1) // (2 * 1) + ((2 + 1 - 1) % (2 * 1) >= 1 - 1) = 1 + 0 = 1
```
This is also correct for this specific input. However, the general formula used in the program does not account for cases where `k` is less than `2 * n * m`, leading to potential errors in the calculation of how many times Sergei is asked.

A more robust approach would involve calculating the exact number of cycles and remaining questions after completing those cycles, and then determining how many times Sergei is asked based on the remaining questions.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function processes five integers \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), \( x \), and \( y \) with given constraints and prints three values: \( \text{max\_asked} \), \( \text{min\_asked} \), and \( \text{sergei\_asked} \). The values are calculated using the formulae: \( \text{max\_asked} = \left\lfloor \frac{k + (n - 1)}{2 \cdot n} \right\rfloor \), \( \text{min\_asked} = \max(1, \text{max\_asked} - (n - 1)) \), and \( \text{sergei\_asked} = \left\lfloor \frac{k + x - 1}{2 \cdot n} \right\rfloor + \left( \frac{k + x - 1}{2 \cdot n} \right) \mod 1 \geq \frac{n - x + 1}{2 \cdot n} \). The function reads these integers from standard input and does not return any value. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
