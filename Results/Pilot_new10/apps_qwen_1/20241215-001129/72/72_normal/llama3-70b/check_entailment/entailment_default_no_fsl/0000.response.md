Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the direction change of the polling order after the teacher asks the last row. Specifically, the code calculates the number of times the teacher asks a particular pupil without considering the alternating direction of the rows. This results in incorrect values for `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` for certain cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 2 9 4 2
```
The expected output is:
```
2 1 1
```
However, the provided code outputs:
```
2 1 2
```

The code does not account for the fact that the teacher alternates between asking from the bottom-up and top-down after reaching the last row. This discrepancy is evident in the calculation of `sergei_asked`, which should only increment when the current row is either the `x`-th row or its mirrored counterpart based on the total number of rows `n`.

To fix this, the code needs to properly handle the alternating direction of the rows in the polling order.
