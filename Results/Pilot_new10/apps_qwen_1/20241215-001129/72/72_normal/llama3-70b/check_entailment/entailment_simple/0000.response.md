Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to correctly handle the logic for determining the number of questions asked to each pupil when the total number of questions \( k \) is very large. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Calculation of `max_asked` and `min_asked`:**
   - The current implementation calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions asked to any pupil using the formula `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)` for `max_asked` and `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))` for `min_asked`.
   - These formulas do not accurately reflect the actual distribution of questions among pupils. The distribution depends on the parity of \( k \) and the specific row and seat position of each pupil.

2. **Calculation of `sergei_asked`:**
   - The calculation of `sergei_asked` is flawed because it assumes a linear distribution of questions without considering the back-and-forth nature of the polling process. It simply divides the total number of questions by the number of pupils and adjusts based on the row position, which is not accurate for larger values of \( k \).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to take into account the back-and-forth nature of the polling and ensure that the calculations are based on the exact number of questions asked within the specified range. The provided solution oversimplifies the problem and does not handle the intricacies of the polling sequence properly.

For example, consider the following scenario:
- \( n = 4 \), \( m = 2 \), \( k = 9 \), \( x = 4 \), \( y = 2 \).
- According to the problem description, the order of asking should be: 1st row (2 pupils), 2nd row (2 pupils), 3rd row (2 pupils), 4th row (2 pupils), 3rd row (2 pupils), 2nd row (2 pupils), 1st row (2 pupils).
- The actual sequence would be: 1st row, 2nd row, 3rd row, 4th row, 3rd row, 2nd row, 1st row, 2nd row, 3rd row.
- The correct answer should be: `2 1 1`, but the provided program would give an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is not correct and needs a more sophisticated approach to accurately simulate the polling sequence and calculate the required values.
