Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum, minimum, and the number of times the teacher asks Sergei based on the given problem description. Here's a brief breakdown:

1. **Cycle Length Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the length of a full cycle, which is `(2 * n - 2) * m` for `n > 1` and `m` for `n == 1`. This ensures that the number of questions asked in one complete round is accurately determined.

2. **Full Cycles and Remaining Questions**: The program correctly divides the total number of questions (`k`) into full cycles and remaining questions. It updates the minimum and maximum number of questions a pupil is asked based on these calculations.

3. **Handling Special Cases**: The program correctly handles special cases such as when there is only one row (`n == 1`), and when the remaining questions after full cycles are processed.

4. **Counting Questions for Sergei**: The program correctly counts the number of times the teacher asks Sergei by considering his position in the row and the direction of the cycle.

5. **Direction Handling**: The program correctly changes direction when reaching the end of a row, ensuring that the sequence of questioning is accurately followed.

Given that the program handles all the described cases and potential edge cases appropriately, and no counterexample was found that would make the program incorrect, the program is correct.
