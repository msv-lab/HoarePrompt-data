Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is very large, leading to potential overflow issues with the division operations. Specifically, the calculation of `full_cycles` and `remaining_questions` involves integer division which may not accurately represent the full cycles and remaining questions if `k` is extremely large. This can lead to incorrect results for the minimum and maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked.

To illustrate, consider the input:
```
100 100 1000000000000000000 100 100
```

In this case, the `full_cycle_length` is calculated as `(2 * 100 - 2) * 100 = 19800`. However, `full_cycle_length` itself is an integer, and the integer division for `full_cycles` and `remaining_questions` might not accurately reflect the true division when `k` is extremely large. This can lead to incorrect calculations for `min_questions`, `max_questions`, and `sergei_questions`.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases due to potential integer overflow and inaccurate division operations.
