Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code shows that the program does not handle all possible values of \( n \) correctly. Specifically, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for \( n = 2 \), even though a valid sequence of fractions exists for \( n = 2 \). According to the problem description, for \( n = 2 \), the correct output should be "YES" and the program should provide a valid sequence of fractions, such as \(\frac{1}{2}\), which sums to \(1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\). The current implementation fails to meet this requirement, making the original assessment accurate.
