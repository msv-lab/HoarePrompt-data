Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Output Format**: The problem description specifies that if such a sequence of fractions exists, the program should output "YES" followed by the sequence of fractions. However, the program only prints "YES" and the first fraction without checking whether a valid sequence can be formed for \( n > 2 \).

2. **Sequence Validation**: The program assumes that for any \( n \neq 2 \), a valid sequence can be formed using the fractions \( \frac{1}{n//2} \) and \( \frac{1}{n} \). While this is true for certain values of \( n \), it does not guarantee that the sum of these fractions will always equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). Specifically, for \( n = 4 \), the fractions \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \) would sum to \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is not \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \).

3. **General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution for all valid \( n \). For instance, when \( n = 6 \), the output is correct because \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6} = 1 - \frac{1}{6} \). However, the program does not handle cases where the direct approach might not work, such as \( n = 12 \).

To correctly implement the program, you would need to check if the direct approach works and, if not, attempt to find other combinations of fractions that satisfy the conditions. Hereâ€™s a more complete implementation outline:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 0
        found = False
        
        for b in range(2, n):
            if (n - 1) % b == 0:
                a = (n - 1) // b
                if 1 <= a < b:
                    k += 1
                    print(a, b)
                    found = True
        
        if found:
            print(k)
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This implementation checks all possible denominators \( b \) and finds corresponding numerators \( a \) such that \( \frac{a}{b} \) is part of the sequence, ensuring the sum equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).
