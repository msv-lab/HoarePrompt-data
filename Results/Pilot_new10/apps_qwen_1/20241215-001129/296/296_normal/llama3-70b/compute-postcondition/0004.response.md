The code simply prints 'YES', which does not affect the value of any variable. The only change is the output of the program. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and n is not equal to 2; the program prints 'YES'.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and n is not equal to 2; the program prints 'YES'**
