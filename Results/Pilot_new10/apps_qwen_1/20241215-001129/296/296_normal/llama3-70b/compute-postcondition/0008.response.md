The code `print('1', n)` prints the string `'1'` followed by the value of `n`. This does not change the value of `n` or `k`. After executing this line, the output is printed, but the variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= \(5 \times 10^8\) and `n` is not equal to 1; `k` is 2; the program has printed `'1'` followed by the value of `n // 2`**
