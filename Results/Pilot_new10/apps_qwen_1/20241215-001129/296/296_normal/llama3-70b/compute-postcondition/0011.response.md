Let's break down the annotated code and return postconditions step by step to determine the functionality of the function.

### Analysis of Annotated Code

1. **Input**:
   - The function starts by taking an integer input `n` from the user.
   - The state before the function starts: `n` is a positive integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^9`.

2. **Conditional Block**:
   - If `n == 2`, the function prints 'NO' and exits without further processing.
   - If `n != 2`, the function prints 'YES', initializes `k` to 2, and then prints `k` along with two pairs of values.

3. **Post-Condition**:
   - After executing the conditional block, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^9`.
   - If `n` is 2, `n` remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is not 2, `n` becomes an integer such that `1 <= n <= 5 × 10^8`, `k` is 2, and the program prints '1' followed by the value of `n // 2` and then '1' followed by the value of `n`.

### Return Postconditions

- **Case 1**: If `n == 2`, the function prints 'NO'.
- **Case 2**: If `n != 2`, the function prints 'YES', `k` is set to 2, and it prints `k` followed by '1' and `n // 2`, then '1' and `n`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic

- The code handles the case when `n == 2` correctly by printing 'NO'.
- For `n != 2`, the code sets `k` to 2 and prints the necessary values. However, the postconditions mention that `n` should be between `1` and `5 × 10^8` after the loop, which is not explicitly handled in the code. This might be a misunderstanding of the logic since the original range for `n` is `2 <= n <= 10^9`.

### Summary of Functionality

The function takes an integer `n` as input, where `2 <= n <= 10^9`. It checks if `n` is 2 and prints 'NO' if true. If `n` is not 2, it prints 'YES', sets `k` to 2, and prints `k`, followed by '1' and `n // 2`, and finally '1' and `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where `2 <= n <= 10^9`) and prints 'NO' if `n` is 2. If `n` is not 2, it prints 'YES', sets `k` to 2, and prints `k`, followed by '1' and `n // 2`, and finally '1' and `n`.**
