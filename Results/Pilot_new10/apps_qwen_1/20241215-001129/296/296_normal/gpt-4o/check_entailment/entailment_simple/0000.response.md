Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Output Format**:
   - The problem description specifies that if such a sequence of fractions exists, the output should include:
     - "YES" on the first line.
     - An integer `k` representing the number of elements in the sequence.
     - Each subsequent line should contain two integers `a_i` and `b_i` representing the numerator and denominator of the fraction.
   - The annotated program does not handle the case when no such sequence exists. Instead, it simply returns "NO" in this case. However, the problem description requires printing "NO" and then stopping execution without producing any further output.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program constructs a sequence of fractions using all divisors of `n` that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.
   - It then checks if there are any such divisors. If there are none, it returns "NO".
   - However, the problem description requires constructing a sequence that sums up to `1 - 1/n`, which involves finding specific pairs `(a_i, b_i)` such that their sum equals `1 - 1/n`. Simply listing all divisors of `n` is not sufficient to meet this requirement.

3. **Sum Condition**:
   - The program does not ensure that the constructed fractions sum up to `1 - 1/n`. For example, for `n = 6`, while the divisors `[2, 3]` are correctly identified, the fractions `1/2` and `1/3` sum to `5/6`, which is not `1 - 1/6 = 5/6`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case when `n <= 2` correctly by returning "NO".
   - However, it fails to handle cases where the required sequence of fractions cannot be formed, even though such sequences may exist for certain values of `n`.

### Example:
For `n = 6`, the program would correctly identify divisors `[2, 3]` but would incorrectly assume that these fractions suffice without verifying the sum condition. The correct approach would involve checking if the sequence can be constructed such that the sum of the fractions equals `1 - 1/6`.

To make the program correct, you would need to:
1. Verify if the required sequence of fractions can be constructed.
2. Ensure the constructed sequence sums up to `1 - 1/n`.

Here's an example of how you might implement the correct logic:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    
    # Find divisors of n
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = []
    remaining = 1 - 1/n
    
    # Construct the sequence
    for d in divisors:
        a = 1
        while a < d:
            if a/d + remaining > 1:
                a -= 1
                break
            if a/d + remaining == 1:
                fractions.append((a, d))
                remaining -= a/d
                break
            a += 1
    
    if remaining != 0:
        return 'NO'
    
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
```

This updated code ensures that the constructed sequence of fractions meets the sum condition.
