Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `total` is unspecified.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2.
   - `divisors` is `[2, 3, n // 3, 3, n // 3]` if `n % 3 == 0`. Otherwise, `divisors` remains as `[2, 3, n // 3]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 4.

5. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - Since `i` is now 4, the loop will continue if `4 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

6. **Update the State:**
   - `total` remains unspecified.
   - `i` becomes 4.
   - `n` remains a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2.
   - `divisors` remains as either `[2, 3, n // 3, 3, n // 3]` if `n % 3 == 0` or `[2, 3, n // 3]` otherwise.

Given these steps, we can update the state:

**State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 4, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` remains as `[2, 3, n // 3, 3, n // 3]` if `n % 3 == 0`. Otherwise, `divisors` remains as `[2, 3, n // 3]`**.
