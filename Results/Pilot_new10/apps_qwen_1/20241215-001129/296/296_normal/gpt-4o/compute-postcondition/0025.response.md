The code calculates the length of the list `divisors` and assigns it to the variable `k`. Since `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, the length of this list is assigned to `k`. The values of `n` and `divisors` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `k` is the length of the list `divisors`.**
