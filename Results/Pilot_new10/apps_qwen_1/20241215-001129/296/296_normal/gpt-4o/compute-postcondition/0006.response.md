The code appends the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Since `i` is initially 2 and `divisors` is an empty list, after appending `i`, the list `divisors` will contain the value 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `total` is unspecified, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is now a list containing `[2]`, and `n` is divisible by `i`.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is `[2]`, and `n` is divisible by `i`.**
