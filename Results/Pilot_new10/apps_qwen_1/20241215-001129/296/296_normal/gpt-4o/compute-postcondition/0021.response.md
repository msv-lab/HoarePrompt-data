To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the given code and the initial conditions.

### Initial Conditions:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2.
- `divisors` is an empty list.

### Loop Code Analysis:
The loop iterates over integers `i` starting from 2 up to (and including) `int(math.sqrt(n))`. For each `i`, if `n` is divisible by `i` (`n % i == 0`), `i` is added to the `divisors` list, and if `i` is not equal to `n // i`, `n // i` is also added to the list.

### Key Observations:
1. **Divisors Collection**: The loop collects all divisors of `n` in pairs `(i, n // i)` where `i` ranges from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. If `n` is a perfect square, the divisor `sqrt(n)` is only added once.
2. **Loop Termination Condition**: The loop will continue until `i` exceeds `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

### Final Output State:
- **If `n` has no divisors other than 1 and itself** (i.e., `n` is a prime number):
  - The loop will not execute since there are no `i` such that `2 <= i <= int(math.sqrt(n))` and `n % i == 0`.
  - Therefore, `divisors` will remain an empty list.

- **If `n` has divisors**:
  - All divisors `i` and `n // i` where `2 <= i <= int(math.sqrt(n))` and `i` divides `n` are collected.
  - The list `divisors` will contain all such divisors without duplicates (if `n` is a perfect square, `sqrt(n)` will appear only once).

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, the `divisors` list will contain all the divisors of `n` that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.**
