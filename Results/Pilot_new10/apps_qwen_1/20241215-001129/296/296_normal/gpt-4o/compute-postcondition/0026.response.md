The code creates a list of fractions where each fraction is represented as a tuple `(1, d)` for each divisor `d` in the list `divisors`. This does not change the values of `n`, `divisors`, or `k`. It only adds new elements to the `fractions` list.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2; `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`; `k` is the length of the list `divisors`; `fractions` is a list of tuples where each tuple is (1, d) for each divisor `d` in `divisors`.**
