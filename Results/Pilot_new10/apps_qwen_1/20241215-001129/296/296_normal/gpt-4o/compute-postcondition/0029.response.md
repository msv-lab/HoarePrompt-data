Let's break down the annotated code step by step to understand the functionality of the function `func_1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The function starts by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 2.
   - If true, it returns 'NO'.
   
2. **Divisors Calculation**:
   - If `n` is greater than 2, the function initializes an empty list `divisors`.
   - It then iterates through values from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - For each `i` in this range, if `n` is divisible by `i`, it appends both `i` and `n // i` to the `divisors` list.
   
3. **Check for Divisors**:
   - After the loop, if the `divisors` list is empty, it returns 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the length `k` of the `divisors` list and generates a list of tuples `(1, d)` for each divisor `d` in `divisors`.
   
4. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, it returns a string formatted as `'YES\nk\n'` followed by each tuple `(a, b)` from the list `fractions` formatted as 'a b'.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic

- **Edge Case 1**: When `n` is 1 or 2.
  - The function correctly returns 'NO' for `n <= 2`.
  
- **Edge Case 2**: When `n` is a prime number.
  - For prime numbers, the `divisors` list will be empty after the loop, leading to a return of 'NO'.
  
- **Edge Case 3**: When `n` is a perfect square.
  - The loop might include the square root of `n` twice, but this is handled correctly by appending both `i` and `n // i`.

- **Edge Case 4**: When `n` is a composite number.
  - The function will correctly find and append all divisors of `n` and return 'YES' along with the count and the pairs of divisors.

### Summary of Functionality

Based on the analysis, the function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It returns 'NO' if `n` is 2 or less, or if `n` has no divisors other than 1 and itself (i.e., it is a prime number). If `n` has divisors other than 1 and itself, it returns 'YES' followed by the count of such divisors and each divisor pair formatted appropriately.

### Final Summary

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and returns 'NO' if `n` is 2 or less or if `n` is a prime number. Otherwise, it returns 'YES' followed by the count of divisors of `n` (greater than 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`) and each divisor pair formatted as 'a b'.**
