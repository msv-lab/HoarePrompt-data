To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables and conditions specified in the `for` loop statement:

1. **Variable `i`:** The loop runs from `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. Therefore, `i` should start at `2` and potentially go up to the integer square root of `n`.

2. **Variable `n`:** The value of `n` must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and greater than `2`, as stated in the problem.

3. **Loop Execution Condition:** The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. Therefore, when the loop starts, `i` should be `2` and `n` should be a value such that `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is at least `2` (which is true given \(2 \leq n\)).

Given these points, let's adjust the initial state accordingly:

- The variable `i` should start at `2`.
- The variable `n` should be a value within the specified range, but importantly, it must be large enough so that the loop condition is satisfied initially. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than `2`, and considering the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the smallest valid `n` is `2`.

Thus, the initial state should ensure that the loop can start with `i` set to `2` and `n` within its valid range.

State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is an empty list**
