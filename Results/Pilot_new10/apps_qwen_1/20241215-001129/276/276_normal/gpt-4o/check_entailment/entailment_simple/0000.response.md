Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the comparison logic required by the problem description. The program calculates the decimal value of the golden system number but does not compare two numbers as specified in the problem statement. Instead, it compares the decimal values of the two numbers, which is not the same as determining which of the two numbers has a larger decimal value.

To meet the problem description, the program should:
1. Calculate the decimal value of both numbers.
2. Compare these decimal values.
3. Print '>' if the first number is larger, '<' if the second number is larger, and '=' if they are equal.

However, the current implementation only calculates the decimal value of one number at a time and does not perform the necessary comparison between the two numbers. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
