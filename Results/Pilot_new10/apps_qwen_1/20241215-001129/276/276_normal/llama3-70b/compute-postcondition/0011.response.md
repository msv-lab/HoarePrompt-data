Let's analyze the provided code step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`: This initializes `q` to the golden ratio.
   - `decimal = 0`: Initializes `decimal` to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The `for` loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `s`.
   - For each character `c` at index `i`, it multiplies `int(c)` (which is either 0 or 1) by `q ** i` and adds the result to `decimal`.

3. **Post-loop State**:
   - After the loop, `s` becomes an empty string because the `reversed(s)` generator exhausts itself.
   - `q` remains `(math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`.
   - `decimal` contains the decimal representation of the binary string `s` in reverse order.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `decimal`.

Given this analysis, let's summarize the functionality of the function:

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, computes the decimal representation of the reversed binary string, and returns this decimal value. If `s` is an empty string, it should theoretically return 0, but due to the loop iterating over an empty reversed string, the `decimal` remains 0, effectively handling the edge case.**
