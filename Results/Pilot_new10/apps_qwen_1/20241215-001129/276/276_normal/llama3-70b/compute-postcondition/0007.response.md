`decimal` is updated to `decimal + int(c) * q ** i`. From the initial state, we know that `c` is the character at index `i` in the reversed string `s`, and `i` is incremented by 1 after the previous line of code. Therefore, in the current line, `i` will be one more than its previous value. The value of `q` and the updated value of `c` will be used to calculate the new value of `decimal`.

Output State: **`s` is the reversed string without the last character, `i` is incremented by 1 (previous value of `i` + 1), `c` is the character at index `i` in the reversed string, `decimal` is updated to `decimal + int(c) * q ** (previous value of `i` + 1)**
