Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers in the "golden system." The `func_1` function accurately converts a golden system number to its decimal equivalent by iterating over the reversed string and summing the products of each digit and \( q \) raised to the appropriate power. The comparison logic is straightforward and works for all valid inputs as per the problem description. The output hints align with the expected behavior of the program, confirming that it handles the conversion and comparison correctly.
