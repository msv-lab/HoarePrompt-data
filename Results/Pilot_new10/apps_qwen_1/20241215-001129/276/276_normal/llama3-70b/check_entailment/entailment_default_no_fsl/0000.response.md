Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that converts a number from the golden system to its decimal representation using the formula \( q^2 = q + 1 \), where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The main part of the code compares the decimal values of two input strings and prints the appropriate comparison symbol ('>', '<', or '=').

The code handles the conversion of each digit in the golden system string to its corresponding decimal value correctly. It iterates through the reversed string, applying the given formula for each digit. Since the problem specifies that the input strings are non-empty and consist only of '0's and '1's, the loop always processes valid inputs. 

The function `func_1` correctly handles the edge case of an empty string by remaining unchanged (returning 0), although the problem ensures this case won't occur. Therefore, the code works correctly for all specified cases.
