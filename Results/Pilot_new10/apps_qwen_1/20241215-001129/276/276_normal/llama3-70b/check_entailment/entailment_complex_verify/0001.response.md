Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The program correctly converts numbers from the golden system to their decimal equivalents and compares these values. The function `func_1` iterates through the reversed string, correctly calculates the decimal value, and returns it. The main part of the program correctly compares the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the appropriate comparison symbol. The annotations confirm that the function handles both non-empty and empty strings appropriately, with the edge case of an empty string being correctly managed. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
