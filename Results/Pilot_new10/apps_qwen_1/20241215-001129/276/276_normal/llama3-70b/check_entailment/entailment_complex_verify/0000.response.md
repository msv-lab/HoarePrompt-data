Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to convert a number from the golden system to its decimal equivalent. The function `func_1` iterates over the reversed string, calculates the decimal value using the property \( q^2 = q + 1 \), and returns the result. The main part of the program then compares these decimal values and prints the appropriate symbol. The annotations align with the expected behavior of the program, and there are no contradictions or errors noted in the code. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
