Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers in the "golden system" (base \( q \) where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \)). The program converts each number from its golden system representation to its decimal equivalent using the `func_1` function. It then compares the decimal values and prints the appropriate symbol ('>', '<', or '=').

The program handles the conversion correctly by iterating over the reversed string, multiplying each digit by \( q \) raised to the power corresponding to its position, and summing these values. This approach ensures that the program can accurately compute the decimal value of a number in the golden system for any valid input.

Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case within the constraints provided, and no specific edge cases or examples were found where the program fails, the program is correct.
