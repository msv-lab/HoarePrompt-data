Final: **False**

Reason: Despite the annotation, the original assessment is accurate because the program still uses `func_1` to concatenate the rows of the puzzle into a single string. This approach loses the grid structure, making it impossible to correctly represent and explore the puzzle states. The annotations incorrectly assume that `func_1` preserves the grid structure, which it does not. Therefore, the reachable states generated by `func_2` are not accurate, leading to incorrect results. The program needs to maintain the 2x2 grid structure to properly explore and compare the puzzle states.
