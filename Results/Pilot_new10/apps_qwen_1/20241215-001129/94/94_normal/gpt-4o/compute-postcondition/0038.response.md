Postcondition: ***`current`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` retain their original states. If `new_row` and `new_col` are within bounds (0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2), then `new_state_str` (formed by joining the elements of `new_state`) is added to both `visited` and `queue` if it is not already present in `visited`. Otherwise, no changes occur in `visited` and `queue`.***
