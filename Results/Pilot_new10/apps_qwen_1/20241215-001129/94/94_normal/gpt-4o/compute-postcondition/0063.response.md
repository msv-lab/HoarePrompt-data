The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends the value of `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The value of `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, which is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped.

Since `new_state_str` is already defined as the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, and this operation does not change the definition of `new_state_str`, the only new information here is that `new_state_str` is appended to `queue`.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `new_state_str` is now equal to the result of `''.join(new_state)`, `visited` contains `new_state_str`, `queue` contains `new_state_str`.**
