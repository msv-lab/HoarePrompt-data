The code snippet `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list from the current state `current`. This does not modify the existing `current` variable but rather creates a new list named `new_state`. The initial state's values of `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, and `new_col` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` is `start`, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current`.**
