Postcondition: ***`current` is the next element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the next pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, and `new_state_str` is either appended to the `queue` or remains unchanged, depending on whether `new_state_str` is already in `visited`. This condition holds true if `new_row` and `new_col` are within bounds (0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2). Otherwise, the state remains as described by the precondition.***
