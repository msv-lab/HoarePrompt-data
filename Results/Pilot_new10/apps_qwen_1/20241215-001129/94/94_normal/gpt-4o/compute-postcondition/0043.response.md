The code `empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)` divides the `empty_pos` (which is the index of 'X' in `current`) by 2 and assigns the quotient to `empty_row` and the remainder to `empty_col`. The initial state tells us that `current` is a list with a reduced length by one, and `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.

Let's assume `current` is a list like `[0, 'X', 2, 3]` (a simple example), so `empty_pos` would be 1 (since 'X' is at index 1). Running `divmod(1, 2)` gives `empty_row = 0` and `empty_col = 1`.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1**
