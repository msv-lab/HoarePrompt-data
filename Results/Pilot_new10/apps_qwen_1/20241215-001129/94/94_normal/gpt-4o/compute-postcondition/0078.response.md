The code `current = queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the queue and assigns it to `current`. This means that the value of `current` is updated to the first element of the queue, and other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is the row index of the empty tile in `current`, `empty_col` is the column index of the empty tile in `current`, `directions` is a list containing the possible movements, `new_row` is the last `dr` used, `new_col` is the last `dc` used, `new_pos` is the last calculated position `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `visited` is a set containing all unique states encountered during the process, and `queue` does not contain the element that was removed.**
