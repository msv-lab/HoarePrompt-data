The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins the elements of `new_state` into a single string. Since `new_state` is a list, the new string `new_state_str` will contain all the elements of `new_state` concatenated together.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code, so their values remain unchanged:
- `current` is a list with a reduced length by one.
- `empty_row` is 0.
- `empty_col` is 1.
- `directions` must have at least one element.
- `new_row` is `dr`.
- `new_col` is `dc + 1`.
- `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`.
- `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 0 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped.
- `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 0 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`, and `new_state_str` is the string joined from `new_state`.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 0 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`, `new_state_str` is the string joined from `new_state`.**
