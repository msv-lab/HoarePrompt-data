The code `empty_pos = current.index('X')` searches for the index of the string 'X' in the list `current`. Since the exact value of `current` is not specified in the initial state, we can only state that `current` is a list that previously had a value at its front, and its length was reduced by one.

After executing the code, `empty_pos` will be assigned the index of 'X' in `current`.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`**
