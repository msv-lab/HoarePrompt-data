The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` assigns the value of `new_pos` based on the values of `new_row` and `new_col`. Given the initial state where `new_row` is `dr` and `new_col` is `dc + 1`, we can substitute these values into the equation to get the new value of `new_pos`.

Since `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, `new_row` can be either 0 or 1, and `new_col` can be 1 or 2 (since `dc + 1` means `new_col` is `dc + 1` and `dc` can be 0 or 1).

- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1`.
- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 2, then `new_pos = 0 * 2 + 2 = 2`.
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos = 1 * 2 + 1 = 3`.
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 2, then `new_pos = 1 * 2 + 2 = 4`.

The values of the other variables (`current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `directions`, `dr`, `dc`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`**.
