The code `empty_pos = current.index('X')` finds the position of the 'X' character in the `current` list and assigns it to the variable `empty_pos`. The previous value of `empty_pos` is not explicitly given, but it will now be updated to the index of 'X' in the `current` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is the row index of the empty tile in `current`, `empty_col` is the column index of the empty tile in `current`, `directions` is a list containing the possible movements, `new_row` is the last `dr` used, `new_col` is the last `dc` used, `new_pos` is the last calculated position `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `visited` is a set containing all unique states encountered during the process, and `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.**
