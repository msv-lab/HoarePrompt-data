The code defines a list `directions` which contains tuples representing possible moves in a 2D grid. These tuples are `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. The values of `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing a 2 Ã— 2 grid configuration of Bessie's puzzle; `queue` is a deque containing the single element `start`; `visited` is a set containing the element `start`; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.**
