The code `empty_pos = current.index('X')` finds the index of the character 'X' in the string `current`. This operation does not affect the other variables. So, `current` remains `start`, `queue` remains a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` remains a set containing the element `start`, and `directions` remains `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`.

After executing the code, `empty_pos` is assigned the index of 'X' in `current`.

Output State: **`current` is `start`, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`, `directions` is `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`**
