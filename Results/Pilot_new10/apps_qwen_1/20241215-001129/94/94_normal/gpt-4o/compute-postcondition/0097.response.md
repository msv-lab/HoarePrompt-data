The code swaps the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. Let's break down the impact:

1. `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
2. `empty_row` and `empty_col` are derived from `empty_pos` using integer division and modulo operations.
3. `empty_pos` remains the same after the swap operation.
4. `new_row` and `new_col` are derived from `empty_row` and `empty_col` plus `dr` and `dc`, respectively.
5. `new_pos` is calculated as `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.
6. `new_state` is a copy of `current` before the swap.

After the swap, the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state` are exchanged.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the first pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
