Output State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` contains the elements of the previous queue, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is \(2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc\), `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`**
