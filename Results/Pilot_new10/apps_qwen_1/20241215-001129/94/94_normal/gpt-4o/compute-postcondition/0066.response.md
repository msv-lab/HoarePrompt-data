According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `directions`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the `directions` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `current` is a list with a reduced length by one.
- `empty_row` is 0.
- `empty_col` is 1.
- `directions` must have at least one element.
- `new_row` is `dr`.
- `new_col` is `dc + 1`.
- `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`.
- `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped.
- `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `directions` list must still have at least one element.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `directions` has at least one element.

State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `directions` must have at least one element.**
