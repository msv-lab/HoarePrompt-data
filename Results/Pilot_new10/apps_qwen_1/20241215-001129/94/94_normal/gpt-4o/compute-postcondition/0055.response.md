Postcondition: ***`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, and `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then the function proceeds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the function remains unchanged since there is no else part specified.***
