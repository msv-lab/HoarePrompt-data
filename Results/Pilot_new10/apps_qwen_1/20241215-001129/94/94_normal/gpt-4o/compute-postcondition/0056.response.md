According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `directions`. The loop continues as long as `directions` has at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were given:
- `current` is a list with a reduced length by one.
- `empty_row` is 0.
- `empty_col` is 1.
- `directions` must have at least one element.
- `new_row` is `dr`.
- `new_col` is `dc + 1`.
- `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`.
- `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped.
- `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`.
- If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then the function proceeds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the function remains unchanged since there is no else part specified.

For the loop to execute one more time, `directions` must have at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `directions` still contains at least one element.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Check the condition for the loop: `directions` must have at least one element.
2. Since no modifications were made to `directions` in the loop body, and it had at least one element before the last iteration, it should still have at least one element for the next iteration.

State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is not in `visited`.**
