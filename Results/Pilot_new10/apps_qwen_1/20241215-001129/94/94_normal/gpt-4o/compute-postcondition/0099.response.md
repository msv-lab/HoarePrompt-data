The line `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. This means that `new_state_str` is now known to have been visited, but none of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the first pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `visited` includes `new_state_str`**
