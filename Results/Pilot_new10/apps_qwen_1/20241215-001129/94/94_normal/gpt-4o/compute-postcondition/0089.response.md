The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string representation of `new_state` to the set `visited`. This operation does not change the values of any variables except for adding the current state to the visited set.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list containing at least one pair of values, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current`, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state` (now updated), `visited` is a set containing all unique states encountered during the process including `new_state_str`, `(0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2)` is true, and `new_state_str` is not in `visited` before the addition.**
