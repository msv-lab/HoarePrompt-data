The code swaps the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state`. Since `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, swapping them back results in `new_state` being equal to `current`.

- `current` remains unchanged.
- `empty_row` remains unchanged.
- `empty_col` remains unchanged.
- `empty_pos` remains unchanged.
- `directions` remains unchanged.
- `new_row` remains unchanged.
- `new_col` remains unchanged.
- `new_pos` remains unchanged.
- `new_state` is now equal to `current`.
- `new_state_str` is updated to reflect the new `new_state`.
- `visited` remains unchanged.

Since the swap operation essentially undoes itself, `new_state` reverts to `current`. 

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list containing at least one pair of values, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current`, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `visited` is a set containing all unique states encountered during the process, and `(0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2)` is true.**
