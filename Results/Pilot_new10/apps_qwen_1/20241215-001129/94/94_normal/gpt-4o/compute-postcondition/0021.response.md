The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` updates the value of `new_pos` by calculating a new position based on `new_row` and `new_col`. Given that `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, we can substitute these into the equation.

First, let's express `new_pos` in terms of the original variables:
- `new_row = empty_row + dr`
- `new_col = empty_col + dc`

Substitute these into the equation for `new_pos`:
\[ new_pos = (empty_row + dr) \times 2 + (empty_col + dc) \]

Expanding this gives:
\[ new_pos = 2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc \]

This equation calculates the new position `new_pos` based on the original `empty_row` and `empty_col`, and the changes `dr` and `dc`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:
- `current` is the current state
- `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed
- `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far
- `directions` must be non-empty
- `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2
- `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`
- `new_pos` is \(2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc\)

Output State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is \(2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc\)**
