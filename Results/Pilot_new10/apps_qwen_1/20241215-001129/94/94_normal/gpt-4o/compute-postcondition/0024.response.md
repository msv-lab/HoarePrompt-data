The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` concatenates the elements of `new_state` into a string using `''` as the separator. Since `new_state` is a list version of `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, the elements of `new_state` are the same as those in `current` but with the specified swap.

The variables `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from their initial states.

The output state is updated only for `new_state` and `new_state_str`. 

Output State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is \(2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc\), `new_state` is a list version of `current` where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state` with no separator.**
