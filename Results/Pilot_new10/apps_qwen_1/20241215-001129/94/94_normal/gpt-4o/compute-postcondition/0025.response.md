The code snippet adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. The `visited` set contains unique states, and since `new_state_str` is created from `new_state`, which is derived from `current`, adding `new_state_str` to `visited` means that the state represented by `new_state` has now been marked as visited.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

- `current` is the current state.
- `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed.
- `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far, now including the new state `new_state_str`.
- `directions` must be non-empty.
- `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
- `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
- `new_pos` is \(2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc\).
- `new_state` is a list version of `current` where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped.
- `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state` with no separator.

Output State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far including `new_state_str`, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is \(2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc\), `new_state` is a list version of `current` where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state` with no separator.**
