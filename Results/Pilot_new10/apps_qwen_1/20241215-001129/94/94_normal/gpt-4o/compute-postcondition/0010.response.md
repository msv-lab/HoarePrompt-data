The code assigns the value of `new_pos` as `new_row * 2 + new_col`. Given the initial conditions:

- `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
- `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.

We know that `(0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2)` is true, which means `new_row` and `new_col` are both 0 or 1.

Let's express `new_pos` using these values:
\[ new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col \]

Since `new_row` and `new_col` are both between 0 and 1 (inclusive), let's consider the possible values:

1. If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 0:
   \[ new_pos = 0 * 2 + 0 = 0 \]

2. If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 1:
   \[ new_pos = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1 \]

3. If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 0:
   \[ new_pos = 1 * 2 + 0 = 2 \]

4. If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 1:
   \[ new_pos = 1 * 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Given that `new_row` and `new_col` are both within the bounds of a 2x2 grid (0 to 1), `new_pos` will be one of the values 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Output State: **`current` is `start`, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3.**
