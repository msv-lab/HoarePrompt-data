The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` updates the value of `new_pos` based on the current values of `new_row` and `new_col`. From the initial state, we know that `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.

Given:
- `empty_row` is 0
- `empty_col` is 1
- `dr` and `dc` are elements in the `directions` list (at least one element)

Therefore:
- `new_row` is `0 + dr = dr`
- `new_col` is `1 + dc`

Substituting these into the equation for `new_pos`:
- `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col = dr * 2 + (1 + dc) = dr * 2 + dc + 1`

The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is not in `visited`.**
