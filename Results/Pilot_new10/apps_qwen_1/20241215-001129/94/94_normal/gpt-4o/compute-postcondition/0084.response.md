The code updates the value of `new_pos` to `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The previous values of `new_row` and `new_col` are already defined, so we can directly compute `new_pos`.

Given:
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`

Therefore, the new value of `new_pos` is:
\[ new_pos = (empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc) \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list containing at least one pair of values, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `visited` is a set containing all unique states encountered during the process, and the condition `(0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2)` is true.**
