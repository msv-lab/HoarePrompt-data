The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins the elements of the `new_state` list into a single string. This operation does not change the values of any variables except creating a new string representation of the `new_state` list.

The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the new string representation of `new_state`.

Output State: **`current` is the next element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the next pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state`.**
