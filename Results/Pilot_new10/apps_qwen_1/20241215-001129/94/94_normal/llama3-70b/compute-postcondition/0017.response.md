Output State: **`i` is 3, `x1` is 3, `x2` is 3.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are strings representing the initial configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles, respectively.
   - Each string has exactly one 'X' (empty cell) and three other characters ('A', 'B', 'C').

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs 4 times, iterating over the indices `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.

3. **First Iteration (`i = 0`)**:
   - The loop checks if `puzzle1[0]` is 'X'. If true, `x1` is set to 0.
   - The loop checks if `puzzle2[0]` is 'X'. If true, `x2` is set to 0.
   - After this iteration, `i` becomes 1.

4. **Second Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
   - The loop checks if `puzzle1[1]` is 'X'. If true, `x1` is set to 1.
   - The loop checks if `puzzle2[1]` is 'X'. If true, `x2` is set to 1.
   - After this iteration, `i` becomes 2.

5. **Third Iteration (`i = 2`)**:
   - The loop checks if `puzzle1[2]` is 'X'. If true, `x1` is set to 2.
   - The loop checks if `puzzle2[2]` is 'X'. If true, `x2` is set to 2.
   - After this iteration, `i` becomes 3.

6. **Fourth Iteration (`i = 3`)**:
   - The loop checks if `puzzle1[3]` is 'X'. If true, `x1` is set to 3.
   - The loop checks if `puzzle2[3]` is 'X'. If true, `x2` is set to 3.
   - After this iteration, `i` becomes 4, which exits the loop.

7. **Final Values**:
   - Regardless of whether `puzzle1[3]` or `puzzle2[3]` contains 'X', the loop sets `i`, `x1`, and `x2` to 3.
   - Therefore, after all iterations, `i`, `x1`, and `x2` will be 3.

8. **Non-execution Case**:
   - If the loop does not execute (e.g., if both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` do not have an 'X'), `i`, `x1`, and `x2` would still be 3 since they are set to 3 at the end of the loop.

Thus, the final state after the loop executes all 4 iterations is:
Output State: **`i` is 3, `x1` is 3, `x2` is 3.**
