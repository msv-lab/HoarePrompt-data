The code assigns the value of `i` to `x2`. Since `i` is in the range [0, 3], `x2` will also take on one of the values from this range. The precondition that `x1` is equal to `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, `x2` will be equal to `i`, and `x1` will still be equal to `i`.

Output State: **`i` is in the range [0, 3]; `x1` is equal to `i`; `x2` is equal to `i`**
