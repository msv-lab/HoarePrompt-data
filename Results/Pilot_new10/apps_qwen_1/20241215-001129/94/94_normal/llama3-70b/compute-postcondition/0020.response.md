The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are strings representing the initial configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles, respectively. Each string consists of four characters, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' represent tiles, and 'X' represents the empty cell. The function returns True if the sorted values of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are equal, given that both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` initially contain [3, 3, 3].
