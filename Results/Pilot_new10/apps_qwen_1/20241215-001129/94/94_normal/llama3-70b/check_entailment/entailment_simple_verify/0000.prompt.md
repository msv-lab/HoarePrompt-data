You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
puzzle1 = [input() + input()]
puzzle2 = [input() + input()]
puzzle1 = ''.join(puzzle1).replace('\n', '')
puzzle2 = ''.join(puzzle2).replace('\n', '')
if func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
    (puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2]) = (puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1])
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to swap the positions of the empty cell ('X') between the two puzzles and then checks if the sorted representations of the puzzles are equal. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks if the relative positions of the tiles can match after one swap, without considering all possible sequences of moves.

For example, consider the following input:

```
AB
XC
CA
BX
```

In this case, the program will check if swapping the positions of the empty cell in both puzzles makes them equal. After the swap, the configurations become:

Puzzle 1: `XA`
Puzzle 2: `XB`

Sorting both gives `AX` and `BX`, which are not equal. Therefore, the program correctly outputs "NO".

However, let's consider another configuration:

```
AB
XC
CB
AX
```

After swapping the empty cells, we get:

Puzzle 1: `XA`
Puzzle 2: `CA`

Sorting both gives `AX` and `AC`, which are not equal. The program again outputs "NO", but the correct answer should be "YES" because we can achieve the configuration `AC` by sliding the 'B' tile from its initial position in Puzzle 1 to the empty cell, and then sliding the 'C' tile to the rightmost position, making both puzzles identical.

Thus, the program does not handle all possible sequences of moves correctly, and there are cases where it will output the wrong result.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
puzzle1 = [input() + input()]
puzzle2 = [input() + input()]
puzzle1 = ''.join(puzzle1).replace('\n', '')
puzzle2 = ''.join(puzzle2).replace('\n', '')
if func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are strings representing the initial configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles, respectively. Each string consists of four characters, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' represent tiles, and 'X' represents the empty cell. Each string guarantees exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 3, `x1` is 3, `x2` is 3.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns True if the sorted values of puzzle1 and puzzle2 are equal, given that both puzzle1 and puzzle2 initially contain [3, 3, 3]


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
