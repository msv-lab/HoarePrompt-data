Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to swap the positions of the empty cell ('X') between the two puzzles and then checks if the sorted representations of the puzzles are equal. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks if the relative positions of the tiles can match after one swap, without considering all possible sequences of moves.

For example, consider the following input:

```
AB
XC
CA
BX
```

In this case, the program will check if swapping the positions of the empty cell in both puzzles makes them equal. After the swap, the configurations become:

Puzzle 1: `XA`
Puzzle 2: `XB`

Sorting both gives `AX` and `BX`, which are not equal. Therefore, the program correctly outputs "NO".

However, let's consider another configuration:

```
AB
XC
CB
AX
```

After swapping the empty cells, we get:

Puzzle 1: `XA`
Puzzle 2: `CA`

Sorting both gives `AX` and `AC`, which are not equal. The program again outputs "NO", but the correct answer should be "YES" because we can achieve the configuration `AC` by sliding the 'B' tile from its initial position in Puzzle 1 to the empty cell, and then sliding the 'C' tile to the rightmost position, making both puzzles identical.

Thus, the program does not handle all possible sequences of moves correctly, and there are cases where it will output the wrong result.
