Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly determine whether the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. Specifically, the function `func_1` is incorrectly merging the rows of the puzzle into a single string, which means it loses information about the puzzle's structure. This can lead to incorrect conclusions about the reachable configurations.

For example, consider the following input:

```
AB
XC
AC
XB
```

- Bessie's puzzle: `AB` `XC`
- Elsie's puzzle: `AC` `XB`

Using `func_1`, the start states for both puzzles would be `"ABXC"` and `"ACXB"`. However, this merges the rows, losing the distinction between the columns. The program then proceeds to generate reachable states for both puzzles using these merged strings, which will result in the same set of states for both puzzles, leading to a false positive.

To fix this, `func_1` should instead return a representation that retains the row-column structure, such as a tuple of strings representing the rows:

```python
def func_1(puzzle):
    return tuple(puzzle)
```

With this change, the program would correctly track the reachable configurations for both puzzles, allowing it to accurately determine if they can reach the same configuration.
