Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to handle cases where the array can be split into multiple subarrays with non-zero sums. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Case Handling**: The code currently handles only two scenarios:
   - When the total sum of the array is not zero.
   - When the first non-zero element is found, it splits the array at that point.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - Consider an array like `[1, -1, 1, -1]`. The total sum is zero, but the array can be split into `[1, -1]` and `[1, -1]`, both of which have non-zero sums. The current code will incorrectly output "NO" for this case.

3. **General Approach**:
   - To correctly handle all cases, the code needs to iterate through the array and ensure that each subarray has a non-zero sum. It should start from the beginning and continue until it finds a subarray with a non-zero sum, then move to the next part of the array.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = []
    l = 1
    
    for r in range(1, n + 1):
        current_sum = sum(A[l-1:r])
        if current_sum != 0:
            result.append((l, r))
            l = r
    
    if len(result) > 0:
        print("YES")
        print(len(result))
        for (l, r) in result:
            print(l, r)
    else:
        print("NO")

func()
```

This version ensures that the array is split into subarrays with non-zero sums and handles all edge cases appropriately.
