You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum != 0:
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, consider the case where the array consists of only zeros. For such an array, the program should output "NO" because it's impossible to split the array into non-empty subarrays where each subarray has a non-zero sum. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario:

- When `total_sum` is zero, the program should output "NO".
- The current implementation only checks if there is at least one non-zero element and splits the array at that point, which does not cover the case where all elements are zero.

Here’s a specific test case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
1
1 1
```

This shows that the program incorrectly outputs "YES" for an array of all zeros, indicating it does not meet the problem description for all cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array A. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3) representing the elements of the array A.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if (total_sum != 0) :
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is `n`, and if any element in `A` is not 0, the loop breaks and prints 'YES', '2', '1', and the index + 1, followed by the index + 2 and `n`. If no element in `A` is not 0, the loop does not execute and prints 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, and `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, the function does not change any variables and continues the execution with the updated state. If `total_sum` is 0, the function checks each element in `A`. If any element is not 0, it prints 'YES', '2', '1', the index (index + 1), followed by the index + 2 and `n`, and stops. If all elements are 0, it prints 'NO' and continues the execution with the updated state.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
