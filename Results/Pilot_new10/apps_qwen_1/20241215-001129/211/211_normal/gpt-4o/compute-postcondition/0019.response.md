The code `print('1', i + 1)` prints the string '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `i + 1` evaluates to 2. Therefore, the print statement outputs '1 2'. This does not change the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0; printed '1 2'**
