The code `print(i + 2, n)` prints the value of `i + 2` and the value of `n`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer value entered by the user. Therefore, `i + 2` is 3. The print statement does not affect the values of the variables, so the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 3, and `total_sum` is 0.**
