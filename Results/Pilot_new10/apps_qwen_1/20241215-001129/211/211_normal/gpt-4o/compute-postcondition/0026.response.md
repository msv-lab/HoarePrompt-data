`i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 5. The `print` function outputs '1 5'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 5.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 5**
