Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `A[i]` is not 0, the output is '2' and `i` becomes 2. If `A[i]` is 0, the values remain unchanged.***
