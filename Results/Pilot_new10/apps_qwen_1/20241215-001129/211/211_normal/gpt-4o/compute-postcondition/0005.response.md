The code `print('1')` prints the string '1' to the console. However, this does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The output of the print statement is just a string displayed in the console and does not alter the values of `n`, `A`, or `total_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and is not equal to 0**
