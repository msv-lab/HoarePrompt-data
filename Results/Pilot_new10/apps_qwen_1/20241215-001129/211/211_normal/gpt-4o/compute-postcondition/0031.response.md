Postcondition: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, and `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, the function does not change any variables and continues the execution with the updated state. If `total_sum` is 0, the function checks each element in `A`. If any element is not 0, it prints 'YES', '2', '1', the index (index + 1), followed by the index + 2 and `n`, and stops. If all elements are 0, it prints 'NO' and continues the execution with the updated state.**
