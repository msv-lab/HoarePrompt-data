Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is the integer value entered by the user.
   - `A` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0.
   - `i` is 3.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each `i` in `range(n)`.

3. **What Happens in Each Iteration:**
   - If `A[i]` is not 0, `total_sum` remains 0.
   - If `A[i]` is 0, `total_sum` remains 0 (no change).

4. **Current Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 3, we are in the 4th iteration of the loop (since indexing starts from 0).

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 4`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - The state of `i` changes to `4`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`i < n`) still holds true as long as `n > 4`.
   - The value of `total_sum` remains 0 because the problem states that if `A[i]` is not 0 or is 0, `total_sum` does not change.

7. **Final State:**
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `A` remains the same.
   - `total_sum` remains 0.
   - `i` becomes 4.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 4**.
