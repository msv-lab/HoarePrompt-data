Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the array can be split into multiple subarrays, each with a non-zero sum, to form the original array. The code only checks for the smallest subarray with a non-zero sum and does not ensure that the entire array is split according to the problem description. For example, consider the input:

```
8
9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3
```

The correct output should be:

```
YES
2
1 2
3 8
```

However, the given code would only output:

```
YES
1
1 2
```

This is because the code does not iterate through the array to find all possible subarrays with non-zero sums. It only finds the first subarray with a non-zero sum and stops there. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
