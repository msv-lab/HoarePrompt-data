Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling of Zero Sum Array**:
   - The problem states that if the sum of all elements in the array is zero, it should output "NO".
   - The current implementation checks if `prefix_sum[n]` is zero and prints "NO" if true. However, this check alone is insufficient because it does not account for cases where the array can be split into valid subarrays with non-zero sums but the overall sum is still zero.

2. **Splitting Logic**:
   - The logic for splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of elements in each subarray is non-zero and the concatenation of these subarrays forms the original array needs to be more thorough.
   - The current code assumes that if any prefix sum is not zero and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then it can form a valid subarray. This is not always correct. For example, consider the array `[1, -1, 1, -1]`. The prefix sums would be `[1, 0, 1, 0]`, and the code would incorrectly print "YES" because it finds indices where the prefix sum is non-zero.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code fails to handle edge cases properly, especially when the array has a zero sum or specific patterns that violate the conditions for valid splitting.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Check if the entire array sum is zero and output "NO" immediately if so.
- Ensure that the splitting logic correctly identifies valid subarrays with non-zero sums.
- Handle edge cases properly to ensure the solution is correct for all inputs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]

    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
        return

    print('YES')
    k = 1
    l = 1
    for r in range(1, n + 1):
        if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
            print(k, l, r)
            k += 1
            l = r + 1
    print(k, l, n)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- The entire array sum is checked for zero at the beginning.
- The splitting logic correctly identifies valid subarrays with non-zero sums.
- Edge cases are handled appropriately.
