Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle all cases as described:

1. **Case Handling for Array with Zero Sum:**
   - The program checks if `prefix_sum[n]` is zero and prints "NO" immediately if it is. However, according to the problem description, if the sum of the entire array is zero, the program should still try to split the array into subarrays where each subarray's sum is non-zero, but such a split may not be possible if the entire array needs to be split into individual elements.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     3
     1 2 -3
     ```
     Here, the entire array sum is zero, but the program prints "NO" directly, which is incorrect as per the problem description. The correct output should be "YES" followed by splitting into subarrays as required.

2. **Handling Multiple Subarrays:**
   - The program uses a single loop to find subarrays with non-zero sums, but it doesn't account for multiple valid splits if they exist. It only prints the first valid split and stops, which may not be the minimal solution as required.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     8
     9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3
     ```
     The program correctly identifies one valid split, but it does not explore other possible valid splits like:
     ```
     1 2
     3 6
     7 8
     ```
     This is because the program only prints the first valid split it encounters.

3. **Printing the Correct Number of Subarrays:**
   - The program prints `k` as the number of subarrays and `l` and `r` as the indices of the subarrays. However, the logic for determining `k`, `l`, and `r` does not ensure that all subarrays are correctly identified and printed.
   - For example, for the input:
     ```
     4
     1 2 3 -5
     ```
     The program should print:
     ```
     YES
     4
     1 1
     2 2
     3 3
     4 4
     ```
     But it incorrectly prints only the first subarray:
     ```
     YES
     2
     1 1
     2 4
     ```

In summary, the program fails to handle cases where the sum of the entire array is zero and does not guarantee finding and printing all possible valid subarrays. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.
