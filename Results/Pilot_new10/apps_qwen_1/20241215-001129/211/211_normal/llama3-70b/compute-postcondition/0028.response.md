The code `print(k, l, r)` simply prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. Since these values are not modified by the print statement, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output of the print statement is `3, n + 1, 1`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `prefix_sum`, `i`, `prefix_sum[n]`) are not affected by this print statement.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `3`, `l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `1`**
