The code `l = r` assigns the value of `r` to `l`. Given that `r` is `1`, `l` will also become `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `1`, `r` is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `1`, `r` is `1`**.
