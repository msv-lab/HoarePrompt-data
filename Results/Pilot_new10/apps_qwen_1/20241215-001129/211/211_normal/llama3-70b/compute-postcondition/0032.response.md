To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states:

### Loop Code Analysis
```python
for r in range(1, n + 1):
    if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
        print(k, l, r)
        k += 1
        l = r
```

### Key Points from the Loop:
1. The loop iterates over `r` from `1` to `n`.
2. For each iteration, it checks if `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.
3. If the condition is met, it prints `k`, `l`, and `r`, increments `k` by `1`, and sets `l` to `r`.

### Observations from Given Output States
- After the loop executes 1 time: `k` is `2`, `l` is `r`, and `r` is in the range `[1, n]`.
- After the loop executes 2 times: `k` is `3`, `l` is `n + 1`, and `r` is `n + 1`.
- After the loop executes 3 times: `k` is `4`, `l` is `1`, and `r` is `1`.

### Understanding the Loop Execution
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there exists an `r` such that `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.
- Each time the condition is met, `k` is incremented by `1`, and `l` is updated to the current value of `r`.
- Once all possible `r` values satisfy the condition or no such `r` exists, the loop terminates.

### Final Output State
After the loop finishes executing, we need to consider the following:
- If the loop executes `m` times, then `k` will be `m + 1`.
- The value of `l` will be the last value of `r` for which the condition was satisfied.
- If no such `r` exists, `k` will be `1` and `l` will be `1`.

Given the pattern observed in the provided output states, the loop will terminate when `r` reaches `n + 1` because there are no more elements in the range `[1, n]` to check.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed plus `1`, `l` is the last value of `r` for which the condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` was satisfied, and `r` is `n + 1`.**
