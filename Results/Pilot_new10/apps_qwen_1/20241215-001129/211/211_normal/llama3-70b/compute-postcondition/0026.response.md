Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `3`, `l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n + 1`. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition is the same as the precondition.***
