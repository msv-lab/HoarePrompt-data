The value of `k` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the updated values are: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is now `2` (since `k += 1` increments `k` by 1), `l` is `1`, `r` is in the range `[1, n]`, `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `0`, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `2`, `l` is `1`, `r` is in the range `[1, n]`, `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `0`, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.**
