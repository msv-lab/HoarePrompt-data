Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `1`, `r` is `1`. If `prefix_sum[r] != 0` and `prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is set to `4`. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**
