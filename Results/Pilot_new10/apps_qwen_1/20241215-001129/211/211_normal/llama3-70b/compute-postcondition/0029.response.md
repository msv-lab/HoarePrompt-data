The code `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. Initially, `k` is set to 3, so after executing this line, `k` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `1`.**
