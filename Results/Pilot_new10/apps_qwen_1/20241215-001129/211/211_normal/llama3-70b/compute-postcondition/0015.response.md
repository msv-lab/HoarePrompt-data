The code initializes `l` to 1. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the only change is the value of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements in the array `A`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `1`, `l` is `1`.**
