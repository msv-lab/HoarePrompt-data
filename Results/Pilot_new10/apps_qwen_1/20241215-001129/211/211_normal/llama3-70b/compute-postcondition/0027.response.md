Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`.
   - `k` is `3`.
   - `l` is `n + 1`.
   - `r` is `n + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The for loop iterates over `r` from `1` to `n` inclusive.

3. **Initial Value of `r`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is `n + 1`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `r` must be within the range `1` to `n` inclusive.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `r` was `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be set to `1` for the next iteration to start.

6. **Maintaining Other States:**
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `prefix_sum` remains the same.
   - `i` remains `n + 1`.
   - `k` remains `3`.
   - `l` remains `n + 1`.

7. **Postconditions:**
   - The postcondition remains the same as the precondition if `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.

Given this analysis, we adjust the state as follows:

**State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `3`, `l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `1`**.
