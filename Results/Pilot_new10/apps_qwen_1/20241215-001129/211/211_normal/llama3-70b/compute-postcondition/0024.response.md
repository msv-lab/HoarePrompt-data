The value of `k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `3`, `l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n + 1`, and the console displays `3 n+1 n+1`.**
