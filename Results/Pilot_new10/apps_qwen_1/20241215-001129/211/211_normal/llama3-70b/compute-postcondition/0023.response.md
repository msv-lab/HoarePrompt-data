The code `print(k, l, r)` simply prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. These values are not modified by the print statement, so their current values are used in the output. 

- `k` is `2`
- `l` is `n + 1`
- `r` is `n + 1`

The output will be these values printed in sequence.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `2`, `l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n + 1`, and the console displays `2 n+1 n+1`.**
