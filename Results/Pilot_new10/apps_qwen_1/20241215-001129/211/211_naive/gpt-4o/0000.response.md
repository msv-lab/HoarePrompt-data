Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the subarrays formed do not have a sum of zero. Here's an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the input:
```
3
1 -1 2
```

According to the problem description, the array should be split into subarrays such that the sum of elements in each subarray is not zero. However, the current implementation does not check for this condition. It simply checks if the total sum of the array is zero and splits the array accordingly.

In the given example, the total sum of the array `1 -1 2` is zero. The program would output "NO" because it assumes that if the total sum is zero, no valid split exists. However, a valid split exists here: `1 -1` and `2`. Both subarrays have a non-zero sum.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, making it incorrect.
