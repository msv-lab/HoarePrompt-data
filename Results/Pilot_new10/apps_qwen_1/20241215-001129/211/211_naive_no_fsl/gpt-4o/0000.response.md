Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, consider the case where the array consists of only zeros. For such an array, the program should output "NO" because it's impossible to split the array into non-empty subarrays where each subarray has a non-zero sum. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario:

- When `total_sum` is zero, the program should output "NO".
- The current implementation only checks if there is at least one non-zero element and splits the array at that point, which does not cover the case where all elements are zero.

Hereâ€™s a specific test case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
1
1 1
```

This shows that the program incorrectly outputs "YES" for an array of all zeros, indicating it does not meet the problem description for all cases.
