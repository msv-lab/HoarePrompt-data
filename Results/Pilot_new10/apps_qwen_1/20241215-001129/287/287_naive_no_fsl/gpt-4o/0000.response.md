Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of divisors of `n`, which is not aligned with the problem description. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`, not the number of divisors.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the input `8`:
- According to the problem description, the valid weights of splits of `8` are `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `8`. This means the output should be `5`.
- However, the program counts the number of divisors of `8`, which are `1`, `2`, `4`, and `8`. It misses the weight `3` because `8` is not divisible by `3`.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.
