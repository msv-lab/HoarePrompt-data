The code `res -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `res`. Given the initial state where `res` is either 0 or 2, and if `n` is divisible by `i`, `res` is set to 2; otherwise, `res` remains 0, the possible values for `res` before this operation are 0 or 2.

- If `res` was 0, after `res -= 1`, `res` becomes -1.
- If `res` was 2, after `res -= 1`, `res` becomes 1.

Since `n` is divisible by `i` when `res` is set to 2, and the condition for setting `res` to 2 still holds true (because the divisibility of `n` by `i` does not change with this subtraction operation), the value of `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9, `res` is -1 if originally 0 or 1 if originally 2.**
