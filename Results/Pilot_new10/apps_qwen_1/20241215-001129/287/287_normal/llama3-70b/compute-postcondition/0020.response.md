The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of `res`. The value of `res` is the number of divisors of `n` minus 1, and this value does not change the state of `n` or `res`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `res` is the number of divisors of `n` minus 1**
