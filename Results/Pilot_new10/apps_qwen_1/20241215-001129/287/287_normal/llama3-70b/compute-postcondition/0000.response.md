`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` will hold the integer input provided by the user. The precondition that the input is a single integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9 ensures that `n` is a valid integer within this range. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9**
