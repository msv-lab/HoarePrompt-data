You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a split of $n$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $n$. 

For example, the following sequences are splits of $8$: $[4, 4]$, $[3, 3, 2]$, $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[5, 2, 1]$.

The following sequences aren't splits of $8$: $[1, 7]$, $[5, 4]$, $[11, -3]$, $[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$.

The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.

For a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$).

-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $7$:

Weight 1: [$\textbf 7$] 

Weight 2: [$\textbf 3$, $\textbf 3$, 1] 

Weight 3: [$\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, 1] 

Weight 7: [$\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$]
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
    print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to count the number of divisors of \( n \) and assumes that each divisor corresponds to a unique weight in the splits of \( n \). However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for all possible weights of splits.

For instance, consider \( n = 8 \):

- The program would correctly identify 1, 2, and 7 as valid weights (from the divisors 8, 4, and 1 respectively).
- It would also incorrectly identify 3 and 5 as valid weights, which are not actually possible based on the problem description.

A correct solution should recognize that for any \( n \), the possible weights are all integers from 1 to \( n \), inclusive. This is because we can always form a split with a weight of 1 (by having \( n \) individual elements each equal to 1), and a split with a weight of \( n \) (by having a single element equal to \( n \)).

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a single integer n where 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `res` is the number of divisors of `n` minus 1.
    print(res)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
