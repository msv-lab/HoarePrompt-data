Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program attempts to count the number of divisors of `n` (minus 1), but this approach does not accurately represent the number of different weights of splits of `n`.

To understand why, let's break down the problem requirements and the program logic:

### Problem Requirements:
- For a given `n`, find the number of different weights of its splits.
- A split of `n` is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`.
- The weight of a split is defined as the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

### Program Logic:
- The program iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`.
- For each `i` in this range, if `n` is divisible by `i`, it increments `res` by 2.
- If `i * i` equals `n`, it decrements `res` by 1.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
- The logic in the program does not relate to counting the different weights of splits of `n`. Instead, it counts the number of divisors of `n` (minus 1).
- For example, consider `n = 7`. The correct output should be 4 because there are four different weights of splits of 7: 1, 2, 3, and 7. However, the program will incorrectly compute the number of divisors of 7, which is 2 (1 and 7), and then adjust by 1, resulting in 1, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you would need to generate all possible splits of `n` and then determine the unique weights of these splits. This involves generating nonincreasing sequences that sum to `n` and counting the distinct weights among them.

Here's a conceptual outline of how you could implement the correct solution:
1. Generate all possible nonincreasing sequences that sum to `n`.
2. For each sequence, calculate its weight.
3. Use a set to track unique weights.
4. Output the size of the set.

Since the provided program does not follow the problem description, the correctness is **False**.
