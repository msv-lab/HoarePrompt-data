The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial value of `count` is 0, so after executing this line, `count` will be 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\); `count` is 1; `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is a divisor of `num`.**
