The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, incrementing `i` by 1 will make `i` equal to 2. The values of `num` and `count` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), `count` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2.**
