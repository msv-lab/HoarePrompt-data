The code initializes a new variable `i` with the value 1. The initial values of `num` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `i` while keeping the values of `num` and `count` as they were.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9; `count` is 0; `i` is 1**
