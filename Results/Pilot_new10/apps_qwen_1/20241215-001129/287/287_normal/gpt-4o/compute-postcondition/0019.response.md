Postcondition: ***`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9, `i` must be such that \((i + 1) * (i + 1) \leq num\); `count` is 2.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is empty, the only case to consider is the if part. According to the if part, if `i != num // i`, then `count` is set to 2. Given the precondition and the fact that the else part does not change the value of `count`, the final value of `count` remains 2 after the if-else block executes.
