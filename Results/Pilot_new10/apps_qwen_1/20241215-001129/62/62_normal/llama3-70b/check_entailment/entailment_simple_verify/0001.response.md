Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The program correctly reads the input, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and compares the resulting decimal values. The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` correctly handles the conversion of a number from a given base to a decimal integer, and the main part of the program correctly uses this function to compare the two numbers. Given the problem constraints and examples provided, the program behaves as expected and the original assessment is accurate.
