Final: **True**

Reason: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers given in different bases. The function `func_1` correctly converts a number from a given base to a decimal integer, and the main part of the program compares these decimal values and prints the appropriate character ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison. The output hints are consistent with the functionality of the program and do not indicate any issues with the program's correctness based on the problem description and examples provided. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
