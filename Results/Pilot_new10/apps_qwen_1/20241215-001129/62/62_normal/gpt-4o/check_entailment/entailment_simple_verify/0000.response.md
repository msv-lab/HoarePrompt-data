Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function. It then compares the decimal values of the two numbers and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on their comparison. Given the problem description and the annotated code, there are no issues or potential scenarios where the program might fail to meet the requirements. The original assessment is accurate as the program handles all valid inputs within the specified constraints and performs the required operations correctly.
