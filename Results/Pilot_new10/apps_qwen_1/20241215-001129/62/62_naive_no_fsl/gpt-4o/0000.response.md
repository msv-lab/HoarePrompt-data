Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function and then compares the decimal values. The logic in the program handles all the given constraints and examples properly. Since the function correctly converts numbers from any base between 2 and 40 and the comparison logic is sound, the program works for all described cases and potential inputs within the specified range.
