The code snippet appends a new string to the `script` list. The new string is formatted as `f'move {file} {i}'`. Before the code executes, `script` contains the additional element `f'move {next_file} {i+1}'`, and `i` is `i + 1`. 

Since the current value of `i` is not specified, let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`. The value of `file` is also not specified, so let's denote it as `file_value`. After `i` is incremented, its value becomes `i_current + 1`. The value of `next_file` is not specified, but we know that `script` already contains `f'move {next_file} {i_current + 1}'`.

After executing the code, `script` will have the following elements:
1. The original element `f'move {next_file} {i_current + 1}'`
2. The newly appended element `f'move {file_value} {i_current + 1}'`

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `script` now includes the additional element `f'move {file_value} {i_current + 1}'`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`script` contains the additional element `f'move {file_value} {i_current + 1}'`, `i` is `i_current + 1`**
