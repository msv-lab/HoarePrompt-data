The code appends a string to the `script` list. The string follows the format `move {file} {i}`, where `{file}` is a placeholder for the file name and `{i}` is the current value of `i`. Since `i` is defined as `len(examples) + 1`, the value of `i` will be updated during the execution of the loop. However, the exact file names are not specified in the initial state, so we can only represent them as placeholders.

Let's denote the file names as `file1, file2, ..., fileN` where `N` is the number of files in `examples`. The value of `i` will be incremented for each file moved, starting from `len(examples) + 1`.

The output state will include the updated value of `i` and the modified `script` list, which will contain the move commands.

Output State: **`script` is a list containing strings 'move file1 (len(examples) + 1)', 'move file2 (len(examples) + 2)', ..., 'move fileN (len(examples) + N)', `i` is `len(examples) + N + 1`, `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1, `regular` is a non-empty list with at least one element.**
