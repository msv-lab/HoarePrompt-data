The code prints the value of `line`. Since the print function outputs the value of `line`, the value of `line` is displayed. However, the value of `line` itself does not change due to this operation. The only affected action is the printing of `line`.

Output State: **`script` must have at least two elements, `line` is its first element, and the output is the value of `line`.**
