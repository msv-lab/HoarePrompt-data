`name` and `type_` are assigned the values from `input().split()`. The input will provide two values separated by a space, which will be assigned to `name` and `type_` respectively. The values of `n` and `files` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list containing \(n-1\) tuples plus one additional tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)), `name` is a string, `type_` is an integer**
