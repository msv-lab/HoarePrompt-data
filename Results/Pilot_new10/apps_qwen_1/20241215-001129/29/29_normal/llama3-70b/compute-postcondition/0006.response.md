The code splits the input into two parts, `name` and `type_`, and assigns them to the corresponding variables. Since the initial state of `n` and `files` is preserved unless explicitly modified by the code, these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list containing \(n-1\) tuples (`name`, int(`type_`)), `name` is a string, `type_` is an integer**
