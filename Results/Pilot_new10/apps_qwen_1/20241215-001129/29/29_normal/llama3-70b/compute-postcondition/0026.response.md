The code `script.append(f'move {file} {i}')` appends a formatted string to the `script` list. This operation does not change the value of `i` or `regular`. However, it adds a new entry to the `script` list with the values of `file` and `i`.

The value of `i` remains `len(examples) + N + 2` as the code does not alter its value.

The condition for `regular` being a list with at least `len(examples) + N + 2` elements is still valid but not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is `len(examples) + N + 2`, `regular` must have at least `len(examples) + N + 2` elements, and `script` contains the appended string 'move {file} {i}'**
