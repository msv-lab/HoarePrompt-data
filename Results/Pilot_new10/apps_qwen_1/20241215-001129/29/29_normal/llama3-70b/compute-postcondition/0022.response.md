Output State: **`script` is a list containing the commands to move each file in `examples` to its corresponding position based on the iteration count, `i` is the total number of files in `examples`, `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1, `regular` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the loop, `i` is the total number of files in `examples`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each file in the `examples` list, appending a move command to the `script` list.
- Since the loop starts at `i = 1` and increments by 1 for each iteration, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the `examples` list.
- The `script` list will contain move commands for each file in `examples`, with the index starting from 1.
- The `regular` list remains unchanged because the loop only processes the `examples` list.
- If the `examples` list is empty, the loop will not execute, and `script` will remain an empty list.
