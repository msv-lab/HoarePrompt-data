The code appends a new tuple `(name, int(type_))` to the list `files`. The variable `name` is a string and `type_` is an integer. After appending, the length of the `files` list will be `n`.

Since the initial state of `n` is a valid integer in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `files` is a list containing \(n-1\) tuples plus one additional tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)), the list `files` will now contain `n` tuples.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a valid integer in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `files` is a list containing `n` tuples**
