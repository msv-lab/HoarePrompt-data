According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `script`. For the loop to execute again, `script` must have at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `script` had at least one element, `line` was its value, and the output was the value of `line`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `script` must have at least two elements. The first element will be assigned to `line` in the next iteration, and the output will be the value of this new `line`.

State: **`script` must have at least two elements, `line` is its first element, and the output is the value of `line`.**
