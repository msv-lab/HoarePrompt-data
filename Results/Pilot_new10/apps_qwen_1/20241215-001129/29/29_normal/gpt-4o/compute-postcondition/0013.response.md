Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of files minus one; `files` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element; `regulars` is either an empty list or a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list; `examples` is either an empty list or a list containing the name of the file; `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list; `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting; `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting. If `type_ == '1'`, `examples` becomes a list containing the name of the file. Otherwise, `regulars` becomes a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list (repeated).***
