According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on two conditions:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`.
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

So, we need to adjust the state to reflect these conditions:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`**
