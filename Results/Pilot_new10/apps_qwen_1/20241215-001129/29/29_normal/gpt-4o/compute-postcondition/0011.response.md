The code appends the `name` to the `examples` list. Given that `name` is the first part of the first file name in the `files` list after splitting, and assuming the initial state where `files` is a list of strings with at least one element, the `examples` list will now include this `name`.

- `files` remains unchanged.
- `regulars` remains unchanged.
- `examples` is updated to include the `name`.
- `file` remains unchanged (it is still the first element in the updated `files` list).
- `name` remains unchanged (it is still the first part of `file` after splitting).
- `type_` remains unchanged (it is still the second part of `file` after splitting).

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files minus one; `files` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element; `regulars` is either an empty list or a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list; `examples` is a list containing the name of the file; `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list; `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting; `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting.**
