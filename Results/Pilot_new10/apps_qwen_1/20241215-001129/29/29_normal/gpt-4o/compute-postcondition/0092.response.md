Let's analyze the given loop and the current state step by step.

### Given Loop
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `temp_counter` is equal to its previous value plus 1.
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

### Analysis
1. **Condition for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `temp_counter` is equal to its previous value plus 1.
   - This means we need to increment `temp_counter` by 1 from its previous value.
   - Additionally, `temp_counter` must still satisfy the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
   - Also, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Increment `temp_counter`:**
   - Since `temp_counter` is equal to its previous value plus 1, for the next iteration, `temp_counter` should be incremented by 1.

2. **Check Condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n`:**
   - Ensure that the new value of `temp_counter` (which is the previous value plus 1) is still less than or equal to `2 * n`.

3. **Check Condition `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set`:**
   - Ensure that the string representation of the new `temp_counter` is still in `files_set`.

### Final State for the Next Iteration
To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, the following conditions must hold true:
- `temp_counter` must be equal to its previous value plus 2.
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Thus, the final state for the next iteration is:
State: **`temp_counter` is equal to its previous value plus 2, and `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
