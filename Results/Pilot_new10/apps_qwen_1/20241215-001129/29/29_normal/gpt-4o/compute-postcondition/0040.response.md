The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, so after the increment, `temp_counter` becomes `2 * n + 3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 2)`, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 3`, `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`, and `str(2 * n + 2)` must be in `files_set`, and `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'` and `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`**
