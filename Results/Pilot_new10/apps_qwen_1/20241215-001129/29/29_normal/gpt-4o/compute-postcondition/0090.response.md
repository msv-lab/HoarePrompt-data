Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: 
   - `temp_counter` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.
   - We need to determine the state such that the loop condition is satisfied for the next iteration.

3. **Analyze the Conditions**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
     - `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
     - `str(temp_counter) in files_set`

4. **Consider Each Condition Separately**:
   - **Condition 1**: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
     - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - **Condition 2**: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`
     - The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in the set `files_set` for the loop to continue.

5. **Combine the Conditions**:
   - Since `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is still within the range `1 <= temp_counter <= 2 * n` and that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - To ensure the loop continues, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Given the above analysis, the new state for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
