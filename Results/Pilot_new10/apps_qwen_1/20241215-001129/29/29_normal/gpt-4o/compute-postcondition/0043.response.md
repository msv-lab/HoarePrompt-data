To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition and the given states.

The loop condition is:
```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - The loop also requires that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 2)`
   - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`
   - `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`
   - `str(2 * n + 2)` is in `files_set`
   - `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'` and `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`

3. **Determining the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` must satisfy both conditions of the loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.
   - Given that `temp_counter` is currently `2 * n + 2`, it does not satisfy the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
   - Therefore, to allow the loop to continue, `temp_counter` must be decreased such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.

### Required Adjustments:
- Decrease `temp_counter` from `2 * n + 2` to a value that is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- Ensure that `str(temp_counter)` remains in `files_set`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 2)`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`, `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`, `str(2 * n + 2)` is in `files_set`, and `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'` and `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`**
