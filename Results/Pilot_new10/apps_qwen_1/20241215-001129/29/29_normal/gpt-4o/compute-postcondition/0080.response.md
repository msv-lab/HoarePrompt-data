The code `regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)` updates the value of `regulars[i]` to be `str(temp_counter)`. Given the initial state, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. Therefore, after executing the code, `regulars[i]` will be updated to `str(temp_counter)`, and all other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`; `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`; `regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`**
