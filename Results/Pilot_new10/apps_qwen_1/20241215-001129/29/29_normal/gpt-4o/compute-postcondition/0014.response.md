Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of files minus one.
   - `files` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element.
   - `regulars` is either an empty list or a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list.
   - `examples` is either an empty list or a list containing the name of the file.
   - `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list.
   - `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting.
   - `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each file in the `files` list.

3. **Loop Body Adjustments:**
   - `file` is set to the current file in the `files` list.
   - `name` is set to the first part of `file` after splitting.
   - `type_` is set to the second part of `file` after splitting.
   - Depending on the value of `type_`, either `examples` or `regulars` is updated:
     - If `type_ == '1'`, `examples` becomes a list containing the name of the file.
     - Otherwise, `regulars` becomes a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list (repeated).

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each file in the `files` list, we need to consider the updated states after processing the current file.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `files` list.
   - After processing the current file, the next file will be the current file for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the `files` list will lose the first element, and `file` will be set to the new first element in the `files` list.

5. **Updated States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `files` will be the remaining list after removing the first element.
   - `file` will be the first element in the updated `files` list.
   - `name` will be the first part of `file` after splitting.
   - `type_` will be the second part of `file` after splitting.

6. **Final States:**
   - `files` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `file` will be the first element in the updated `files` list.
   - `name` will be the first part of `file` after splitting.
   - `type_` will be the second part of `file` after splitting.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
- `files` must contain at least one element.
- `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list.
- `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting.
- `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting.

State: **`files` must contain at least one element, `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list, `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting.**
