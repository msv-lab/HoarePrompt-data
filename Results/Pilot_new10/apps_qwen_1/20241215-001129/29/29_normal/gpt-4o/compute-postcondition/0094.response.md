Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State
- `regulars` contains at least one element.
- `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`.
- `temp_counter` is unchanged.
- `files_set` is unchanged.
- `moves` is unchanged.

### Loop Code
```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    temp_counter += 1
```

### Observations from Example Outputs
1. **After 1 iteration:**
   - `temp_counter` is increased by 1.
   
2. **After 2 iterations:**
   - `temp_counter` is equal to its previous value plus 1.
   - `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

3. **After 3 iterations:**
   - `temp_counter` is equal to its previous value plus 3.
   - `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
- The loop increments `temp_counter` as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string representation of `temp_counter` exists in `files_set`.
- Each time the condition is satisfied, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.

### Final State After All Iterations
- The loop will continue to increment `temp_counter` until it either exceeds `2 * n` or the string representation of `temp_counter` is no longer in `files_set`.
- Therefore, the final value of `temp_counter` will be the last value for which `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

### Conclusion
- `temp_counter` will be the largest integer such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.
- The other variables (`regulars`, `target`, `files_set`, `moves`) remain unchanged.

### Output State
Output State: **`temp_counter` is the largest integer such that `temp_counter` <= 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, `regulars` contains at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`, `files_set` is unchanged, `moves` is unchanged.**
