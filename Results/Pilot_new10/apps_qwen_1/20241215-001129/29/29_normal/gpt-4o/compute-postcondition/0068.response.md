Output State: **`examples` is a list where each element is either the index of a file or `2 * n + 1`, `temp_counter` is `3 * n + 3`, `moves` contains a series of move commands, `files_set` contains all the file names in the final state, `regulars` and `examples` contain the names of all files with types '0' and '1' respectively, and `moves` contains a series of move commands based on the conditions met during the loop execution.**

### Explanation:
1. **`examples`**: Each element in the `examples` list will either be the index of a file (a string representation of an integer from `1` to `2 * n`) or the special value `2 * n + 1` (indicating that the file has been moved to this position).
2. **`temp_counter`**: The value of `temp_counter` will be `3 * n + 3` because the loop increments `temp_counter` by 1 until it reaches `2 * n` and then continues to increment it further. The loop runs for each element in `examples`, so the maximum value of `temp_counter` will be reached when `i` is the last index of `examples`.
3. **`moves`**: The `moves` list will contain a series of move commands based on the conditions within the loop. Each command moves a file from its current position to another position. The commands are determined by whether `examples[i]` matches `str(i + 1)` or not.
4. **`files_set`**: This set will contain all the file names in the final state, regardless of their type ('0' or '1'), as the loop processes all elements in `examples`.
5. **`regulars` and `examples`**: These lists will retain their original contents unless a file has been moved, in which case it will appear in `examples` as `2 * n + 1`.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `len(examples) == 0`), then the values of `examples`, `temp_counter`, and `moves` will remain as initialized:
- `examples` is an empty list.
- `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.
- `moves` is an empty list.
