`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` was `2 * n - 1`. After incrementing, `temp_counter` becomes `2 * n`. The states of the other variables (`regulars`, `target`, and `files_set`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`regulars` contains at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` is `2 * n`, `files_set` remains unchanged.**
