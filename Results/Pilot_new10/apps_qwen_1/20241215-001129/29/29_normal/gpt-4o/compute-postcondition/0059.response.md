`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` and it must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`. After executing `temp_counter += 1`, the new value of `temp_counter` is `(temp_counter + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `temp_counter + 2`. The conditions that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set` remain valid.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 2`, it must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`**
