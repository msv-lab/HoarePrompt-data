Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop variable is `i`, and the loop runs over `range(len(regulars))`. This means the loop will run from `0` to `len(regulars) - 1`.

2. **Determine the Necessary Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, `regulars` must contain at least one element. If `regulars` is an empty list, the loop will not execute.

3. **Initial Values of Variables**:
   - `examples`: A list where each element is either the index of a file or `2 * n + 1`.
   - `temp_counter`: Value is `3 * n + 3`.
   - `moves`: Contains a series of move commands.
   - `files_set`: Contains all the file names in the final state.
   - `regulars`: Contains the names of all files with type '0'.
   - `examples`: Also contains the names of all files with type '1'.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `regulars` must contain at least one file for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `regulars` is not an empty list.
   - The values of `temp_counter`, `moves`, `files_set`, and `examples` do not directly affect the execution of the loop but are part of the overall program state.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `regulars` must contain at least one element.

State: **`regulars` must contain at least one element**
