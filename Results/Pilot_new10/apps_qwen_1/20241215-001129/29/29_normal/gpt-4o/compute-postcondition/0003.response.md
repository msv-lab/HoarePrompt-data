The code splits the `file` string into two parts using the `split()` method and assigns the first part to `name` and the second part to `type_`. The value of `file` is the first element in the `files` list, and it is split into `name` and `type_`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files; `files` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element; `regulars` is an empty list; `examples` is an empty list; `file` is the first element in the `files` list; `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting; `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting.**
