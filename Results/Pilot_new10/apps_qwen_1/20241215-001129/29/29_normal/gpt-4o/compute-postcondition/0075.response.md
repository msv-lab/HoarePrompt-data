`temp_counter` is initially incremented by 1, so it is now `temp_counter + 2`. It is also stated that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. After executing `temp_counter += 1`, `temp_counter` is further incremented by 1, making it `temp_counter + 3`. The condition that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` remains unchanged, and `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 3`, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**
