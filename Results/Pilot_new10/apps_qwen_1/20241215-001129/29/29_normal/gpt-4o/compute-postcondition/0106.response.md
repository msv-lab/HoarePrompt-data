Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States
- `regulars` contains at least one element.
- `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`.
- `temp_counter` is `2 * n`.
- `files_set` remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

### Analysis
1. **First Part of the Condition (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`)**:
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - Currently, `temp_counter` is `2 * n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n` in the next iteration.

2. **Second Part of the Condition (`str(temp_counter) in files_set`)**:
   - The loop continues as long as the string representation of `temp_counter` is in `files_set`.
   - Since `temp_counter` is `2 * n`, we need to check if `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`.

### Required Adjustments
To allow the loop to execute one more time, both conditions need to be satisfied in the next iteration:

1. **First Part**: `temp_counter` needs to be less than `2 * n`. This means we need to decrement `temp_counter` by 1.
2. **Second Part**: Ensure that `str(temp_counter)` (which would now be `str(2 * n - 1)`) is in `files_set`.

### Updated State
Given the above requirements, we need to adjust the state as follows:

- Decrease `temp_counter` by 1 to make it `2 * n - 1`.
- Ensure that `str(2 * n - 1)` is in `files_set`.

Thus, the updated state is:

**State: `regulars` contains at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` is `2 * n - 1`, `files_set` remains unchanged.**
