`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The value of `temp_counter` was previously less than or equal to `2 * n`, so now it is `temp_counter + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `regulars` contains at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, and `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter)`.
