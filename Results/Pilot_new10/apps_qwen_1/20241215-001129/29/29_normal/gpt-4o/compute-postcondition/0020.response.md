The code initializes an empty list named `moves`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `files`, `regulars`, and `examples`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files, `files` is an empty list, `regulars` is a list containing the names of all files with type '0', `examples` is a list containing the names of all files with type '1', `moves` is an empty list**
