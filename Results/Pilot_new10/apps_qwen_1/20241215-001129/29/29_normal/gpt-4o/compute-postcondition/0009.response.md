Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer representing the number of files.
- `files` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element.
- `regulars` is either an empty list or a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list.
- `examples` is either an empty list or a list containing the name of the file.
- `file` is the first element in the `files` list.
- `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting.
- `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting.
- If `type_` is '1', then `regulars` is a list containing the `name`. Otherwise, `regulars` is a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list.

### Loop Iteration
The loop iterates over each file in the `files` list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **File Processing**: The loop processes the first file in the `files` list (stored in the variable `file`).
2. **Splitting File Name**: The file name is split into `name` and `type_`.
3. **Updating States Based on `type_`**:
   - If `type_` is '1', `regulars` is updated to contain `name`.
   - Otherwise, `regulars` remains as it was, containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list.

### Adjusting States for Next Iteration

1. **Removing the First File**: Since the loop processes the first file, the first element of `files` is removed.
2. **Updating `files` List**: The `files` list now contains all elements except the first one.
3. **Updating `file` Variable**: For the next iteration, `file` becomes the new first element of the updated `files` list.
4. **Checking `regulars`**: Depending on the value of `type_`, `regulars` might change, but since we don't know the exact content of the next file, we keep it as it is for the next iteration unless the `type_` of the next file is '1'.

### Final State Adjustment

- `files` will have one less element.
- `file` will be the new first element of `files`.
- `name` and `type_` will be updated based on the new `file`.

### Updated State

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files minus one; `files` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element; `regulars` is either an empty list or a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list; `examples` is either an empty list or a list containing the name of the file; `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list; `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting; `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting.**
