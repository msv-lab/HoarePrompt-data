#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a simple cake. The length of the list is a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and for each tuple (r_i, h_i), 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10 000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer value entered by the user; `cakes` is a list containing `n` tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(volume, r, h)`, with `volume = math.pi * r^2 * h`, `r` is an integer from input, and `h` is an integer from input.
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by their volume, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the maximum value of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for all `j < i` where `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`. If no such `j` exists, `dp[i]` is `cakes[i][0]`. The loop does not execute if `n` is 1, in which case `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]` and all other elements of `dp` remain 0.0.
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a simple cake. It calculates the volume of each cake and sorts the cakes in descending order by volume. Then, it uses dynamic programming to find the maximum total volume of non-overlapping cakes, where a cake can only be chosen if its radius and height are both smaller than those of the previously chosen cake. Finally, it prints the maximum total volume.
