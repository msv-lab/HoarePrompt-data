Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[1]` is set as follows: if `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[1]` is `initial_dp_1 + cakes[1][0]`, where `initial_dp_1` is `cakes[1][0]` if `cakes[1][1] < cakes[0][1]` and `cakes[1][2] < cakes[0][2]`, otherwise `initial_dp_1` is `dp[0] + cakes[1][0]`. Since there is no else part, this is the final state of `dp[1]` after the if-else block executes.***
