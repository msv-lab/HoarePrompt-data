According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from `i-1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `i` is `n`
- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` (with `cakes` remaining unchanged)

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable `j` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `n-2`.

Given this information, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `n-2`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` (with `cakes` remaining unchanged)**
