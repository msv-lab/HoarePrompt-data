According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`. For each `j`, it checks if the condition `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` is met. If the condition is met, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `dp[i]` is an integer.
- The condition `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` is checked for some unspecified `j`.
- If the condition is met, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`.

For the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:
- The loop will check the condition for `j = i-1` next.
- The value of `dp[i]` might change based on the condition being met for `j = i-1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the potential update of `dp[i]` for `j = i-1`.

State: **`dp[i]` is an integer. If the condition `cakes[i][1] < cakes[i-1][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[i-1][2]` is met, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[i-1] + cakes[i][0]`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
