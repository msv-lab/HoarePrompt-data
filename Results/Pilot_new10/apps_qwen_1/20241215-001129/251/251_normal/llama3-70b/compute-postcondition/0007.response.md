`cakes` is a list containing one tuple \((\pi r^2 h, r, h)\), where \(r\) and \(h\) are the first and second integers from the input respectively. The code appends a new tuple to the `cakes` list with the same formula \((\pi r^2 h, r, h)\). Therefore, the updated `cakes` list will contain two tuples.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value entered by the user and must be greater than 1; `cakes` is a list containing two tuples, the first tuple is \((\pi r^2 h, r, h)\) and the second tuple is also \((\pi r^2 h, r, h)\)**
