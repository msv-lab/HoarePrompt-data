The code `r, h = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers from the user input, splits them, and assigns them to `r` and `h`. Since `n` was an integer value entered by the user and must be greater than 2, and now the user inputs two more integer values for `r` and `h`, `n` retains its initial state, `cakes` remains unchanged, `r` is assigned the first integer, and `h` is assigned the second integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value entered by the user and must be greater than 2, `cakes` is a list containing two tuples, the first tuple is (\(\pi r^2 h, r, h\)) and the second tuple is also (\(\pi r^2 h, r, h\)), `r` is the first integer entered by the user, `h` is the second integer entered by the user**
