Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `j` is `n-2`, `dp[n]` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `dp[n-2] + cakes[n][0]`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num` and `x` remain unchanged. This holds true if `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`. If the condition is not met, the state remains unchanged.***
