The code `result = func_1(n, cakes)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `cakes`. The values of `n` and `cakes` are derived from the initial state:

- `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data`.
- `cakes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integers from elements at odd indices (starting from the third element) and even indices (starting from the fourth element) of the list `data`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, the values of `n` and `cakes` remain unchanged after calling the function.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings starting from the second element, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the integers `int(data[2 * i + 1])` and `int(data[2 * i + 2])` for each `i` in the range `n`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`.**
