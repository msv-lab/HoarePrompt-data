Let's analyze the given annotated code and the return postconditions step by step:

1. **Input Parameters:**
   - The function `func_2` takes no direct parameters but reads input from stdin.
   - The input consists of a string split into a list, where the first element is an integer `n` and the subsequent elements are pairs of integers representing the radius and height of cakes.

2. **Processing Input:**
   - The first element of the input string is converted to an integer `n`, which represents the number of cakes.
   - The remaining elements are processed in pairs to form a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the radius and height of a cake.

3. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_2` calls another function `func_1` with `n` and the list of cake tuples as arguments.

4. **Output:**
   - The result returned by `func_1` is printed with six decimal places using formatted string interpolation.

5. **Annotations vs. Code:**
   - The annotations suggest that the function `func_2` directly accepts `n` and `cakes` as parameters, but the code actually reads these from input.
   - The annotations do not account for the specific processing of the input string, which the code does.

**Functionality:**
The function `func_2` reads a string from standard input, processes it to extract the number of cakes and their dimensions, and then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters. The result from `func_1` is then printed with six decimal places.

**Summary:**
Functionality: **The function reads a string from standard input containing the number of cakes and their dimensions, processes this input to form a list of tuples, and then calls another function `func_1` with this list. The result from `func_1` is printed with six decimal places.**
