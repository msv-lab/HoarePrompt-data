`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `volumes[i]`. The value of `i` is [previous i + 1], and `n` must still be greater than [previous i + 1]. The value of `total` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is [previous total], `i` is [previous i + 1] + 1, `n` must be greater than [previous i + 1] + 1, `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`**
