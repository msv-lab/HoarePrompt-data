According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = i-1`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0 because if `i` is 0 or less, the range function will not generate any values for `j`.

Given that `dp[i]` is initially equal to `volumes[i]`, and the values of `volumes` and `i` remain unchanged, no additional adjustments are needed for these variables.

State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, `i` must be greater than 0**
