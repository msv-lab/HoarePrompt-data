`n` is assigned the value `int(data[0])`, which converts the first element of the list `data` (a string) into an integer. The value of `n` is now this integer, and the length of the `data` list is reduced by one since we accessed its first element. The value of `cakes` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings starting from the second element, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, and `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 <= radius[i], height[i] <= 10 000 for all 0 <= i < n.**
