The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, and a parameter `cakes`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list represents the radius and height of the i-th cake, where both the radius and height are integers such that 1 <= radius[i], height[i] <= 10,000 for all 0 <= i < n.

The function returns a value based on the given conditions but since no specific return conditions are mentioned in the provided output cases, we can infer that the function might calculate something related to the cakes (e.g., volume, surface area, etc.), but without more specific details, we cannot determine the exact return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n` (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000) and a parameter `cakes` (a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake).**
