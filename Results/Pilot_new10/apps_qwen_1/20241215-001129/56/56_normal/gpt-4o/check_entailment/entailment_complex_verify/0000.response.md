Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code provides a detailed step-by-step explanation of the program's logic, and it aligns well with the problem description. After reviewing the annotated code, it appears that the program correctly handles the case when `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is 1. For instance, for the input `2 1`, the program should output `Yes -1` because \(2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = 1\), and it does so according to the annotated steps. The original assessment was based on an incorrect understanding of the program's behavior, as the annotated version clearly shows that the program accounts for the special case where `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is 1. Therefore, the original assessment was not accurate.
