Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in `n`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from 60 down to 0, examining each bit position of `n`.
- For each iteration, it checks if the `i`-th bit of `n` is set to 1 using the condition `if n >> i & 1`.
- If the bit is set to 1, it appends the index `i` to the `bits` list.
- After the loop completes, `bits` will contain the indices of all the bits that were set to 1 in `n`.

Since the loop does not modify `n` or `k`, their values remain unchanged after the loop finishes. The `bits` list will contain the positions of all the 1 bits in the binary representation of `n`.
