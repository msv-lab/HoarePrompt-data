The code `bits.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 58) to the list `bits`. Since `bits` was not defined in the initial state, it implies that `bits` is being created and populated with the value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer
- `i` is 58

After executing the code, the value of `i` remains unchanged, and the list `bits` is created and contains the single element 58.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 58, `bits` is [58]**
