According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `len(bits)`. If `len(bits)` is less than `k`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `len(bits)` is less than or equal to `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `len(bits)` must be less than `k`.

Since `len(bits)` is currently less than or equal to `k`, we need to adjust the state such that `len(bits)` becomes strictly less than `k`. This means we need to ensure that the length of `bits` is exactly less than `k` rather than being equal to `k`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this condition.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in `n`, and the length of `bits` is strictly less than `k`.**
