The code appends `smallest - 1` to the list `bits`. The variable `n` and the variable `k` remain unchanged. The variable `smallest` also remains unchanged, but `bits` now includes the new value `smallest - 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in `n` with the smallest index removed and now includes `smallest - 1`, `smallest` is the index of the bit that was removed from `bits`.**
