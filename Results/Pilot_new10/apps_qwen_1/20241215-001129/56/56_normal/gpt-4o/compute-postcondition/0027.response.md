The code `smallest = bits.pop()` removes the last element from the list `bits` and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. Given the initial state, `smallest` was the last element in `bits` before the pop operation. After the pop operation, `smallest` is no longer in `bits`, and `len(bits)` is reduced by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `bits` is a list containing elements except the last one, `smallest` is the last element in the original `bits`, and `len(bits) < k` still holds true.**
