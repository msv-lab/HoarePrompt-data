The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and `k`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\). The function has two cases for its output:
- Case_1: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\); if a specific condition is met (not detailed here but implied by the structure of the problem), the function returns a certain value or result.
- Case_2: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\); if a different specific condition is met (not detailed here but implied by the structure of the problem), the function returns a different value or result.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k` and return a value based on specific conditions that are not detailed here but imply a conditional outcome depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\), and returns a value based on specific conditions.**
