`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that both `n` and `k` will be integers, and they are obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer. The initial conditions of `n` being a non-negative integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) and `k` being a positive integer between 1 and \(10^{5}\) are preserved, but their specific values are now determined by the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ \(10^{18}\), 1 ≤ `k` ≤ \(10^{5}\)**
