According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `n - 2`, and `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

The state at the end of the previous iteration already indicates that `n` is `n - 2`, but we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue. Since `n` is `n - 2` from the previous iteration, this means that `n` was at least 2 in the previous iteration to become `n - 2`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue, but strictly greater than 0 to enter the current iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
