According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `n_0 - 2`, and `i` is increased by 1.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. Since `n` is currently `n_0 - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 1 at the start of the next iteration. This means that `n_0` must have been at least 3 initially (since `n_0 - 2` should be greater than 0).

So, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
