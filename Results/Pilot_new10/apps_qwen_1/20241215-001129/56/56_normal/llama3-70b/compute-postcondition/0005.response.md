`i` is assigned the value `0`. The initial values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `a` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ \(10^{18}\), 1 ≤ `k` ≤ \(10^{5}\), and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
