The code `print('Yes')` does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `a`, or `i`. It simply prints the string 'Yes' to the console. The output of the print statement is not stored in any variable and does not change the state of the variables provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list of the first `k` zeros in descending order, `i` is the number of iterations performed, and 'Yes' is printed to the console.**
