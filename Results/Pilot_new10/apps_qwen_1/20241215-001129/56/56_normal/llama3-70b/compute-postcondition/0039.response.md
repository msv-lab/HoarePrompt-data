Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a non-negative integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer between 1 and \(10^5\)). It calculates the highest bit set in `n` and stores these bits in a list `a`. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the first `k` elements of `a` sorted in descending order.**
