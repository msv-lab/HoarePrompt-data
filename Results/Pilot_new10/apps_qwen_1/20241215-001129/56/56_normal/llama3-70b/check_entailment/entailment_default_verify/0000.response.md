Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than the smallest possible sum that can be achieved with `k` integers. Specifically, the program checks if `n < k` and prints "No" immediately, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The program should be able to express `n` as a sum of `k` powers of 2 even if `n < k`, as long as it includes zeros in the sequence. The output hints confirm that the program fails to handle this case correctly, for example, in the case of input `1 5`, the expected output is `Yes 0 0 0 0 0`, but the program outputs `No`. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
