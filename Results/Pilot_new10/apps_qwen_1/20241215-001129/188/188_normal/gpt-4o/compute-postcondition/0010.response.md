Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `count` is a Counter object with elements from `cards` and their counts, `unique_numbers` is a list of unique numbers from `cards` sorted by their counts in ascending order. The length of `unique_numbers` is at least 2, and either `count[unique_numbers[-1]] != n // 2` or `count[unique_numbers[-2]] != n // 2`***
