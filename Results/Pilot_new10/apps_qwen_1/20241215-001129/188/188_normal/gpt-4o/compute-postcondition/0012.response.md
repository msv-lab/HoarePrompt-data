Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `count` is a Counter object with elements from `cards` and their counts, `unique_numbers` is a list of unique numbers from `cards` sorted by their counts in ascending order. The length of `unique_numbers` is at least 2. If the last two elements of `unique_numbers` each occur exactly `n // 2` times, the last two elements of `unique_numbers` are printed. Otherwise, nothing specific is done (the program continues execution in a default state).***
