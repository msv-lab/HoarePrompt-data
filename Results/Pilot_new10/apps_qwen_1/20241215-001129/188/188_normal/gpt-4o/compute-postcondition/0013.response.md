Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `count` is a Counter object with elements from `cards` and their counts, `unique_numbers` is a list of unique numbers from `cards` sorted by their counts in ascending order. If the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2, 'NO' is printed to the console. Otherwise, if the last two elements of `unique_numbers` each occur exactly `n // 2` times, these two elements are printed. Otherwise, no specific action is taken (the program continues execution in a default state).***
