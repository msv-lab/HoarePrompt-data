Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of cards (`n`) and the numbers on each card, ensuring that `n` is an even number between 2 and 100.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each unique number on the cards.

3. **Sorting Unique Numbers**: It sorts the unique numbers by their counts in ascending order, which helps in identifying the two most frequent numbers easily.

4. **Fair Game Check**: The program checks if there are at least two unique numbers. If not, it prints "NO" since it's impossible to divide the cards fairly. If there are two unique numbers, it further checks if each of these numbers occurs exactly `n // 2` times. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES" followed by these two numbers; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases appropriately:
   - If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it correctly identifies that the game cannot be fair and prints "NO".
   - If the two most frequent numbers each occur exactly `n // 2` times, it correctly identifies this as a valid scenario for a fair game and prints the appropriate output.

Given that the program meets all the criteria specified in the problem description and handles all potential scenarios correctly, the program is correct.
