Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code fails to check if the two most frequent numbers are distinct. According to the problem description, Petya and Vasya need to choose two distinct integers. However, the code only checks if the two most frequent numbers occur exactly `n // 2` times and does not ensure that these numbers are different.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
In this case, both numbers 1 and 2 occur twice (`n // 2` times), but they are the same number. Therefore, the game cannot be fair, and the output should be "NO". However, the current implementation would incorrectly output "YES" and print "1 2".

To fix this, you need to add a check to ensure that the two most frequent numbers are distinct before concluding that the game can be fair. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x], reverse=True)
    
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    elif count[unique_numbers[0]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[1]] == n // 2 and unique_numbers[0] != unique_numbers[1]:
        print('YES')
        print(unique_numbers[0], unique_numbers[1])
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected code ensures that the two numbers chosen by Petya and Vasya are distinct and occur exactly `n // 2` times, thus correctly determining if the game can be fair.
