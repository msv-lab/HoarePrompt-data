The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Here, `i` is the second element of the list `a`. Since `i` is an integer from the second element of the list `a`, and `a` contains `n` elements where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `i` is an integer value. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we can only say that `i` is the second element of `a`.

The dictionary `d` will have its value at key `i` incremented by 1. The states of `n`, `a`, and `d` (other than the increment) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, and `d` is a dictionary with the value of `d[i]` incremented by 1.**
