Let's break down the given task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop is iterating over the list `a`.
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop control variable.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - It is given that `i` is equal to `n`.

3. **Understand the List `a`:**
   - `a` is a list containing `n` elements.
   - Each element in `a` is an integer.

4. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `a`.
   - Since `i` is set to `n` initially, and the loop iterates through `a`, `i` will take the value of each element in `a` one by one.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element.
   - Since `i` is set to `n` initially, we need to ensure that `n` is a valid number of elements for the list `a`.
   - The initial value of `i` (`n`) should be consistent with the length of the list `a`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that:
- `a` is a list with `n` elements.
- `i` is set to the first element of the list `a` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, `d` is an empty dictionary {}**
