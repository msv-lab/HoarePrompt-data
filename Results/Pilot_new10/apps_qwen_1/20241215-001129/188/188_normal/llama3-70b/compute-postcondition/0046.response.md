`c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` is either 0 or 1. Since `c` is incremented by 1, the new value of `c` will be 1 if it was initially 0, and 2 if it was initially 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `a1` is equal to the current key `i` from `d`, `a2` is either -1 or equal to `i`, and `d` must have at least one key.**
