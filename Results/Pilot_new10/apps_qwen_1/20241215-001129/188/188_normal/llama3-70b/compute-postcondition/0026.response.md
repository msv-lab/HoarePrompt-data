`a1` and `a2` are assigned the value `-1`. The values of `n`, `a`, `d`, and `c` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1**
