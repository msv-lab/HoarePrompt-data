Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is either -1 or the key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is either -1 or equal to `i`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains as an even number between 2 and 100 since the loop does not modify this variable.
- **`a`**: Remains as a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, as the loop does not modify the list `a`.
- **`d`**: Remains as a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`. The loop does not modify the dictionary `d`.
- **`c`**: This variable can be 0, 1, or 2. If the loop finds a key `i` in `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, then `c` will be set to 2. If `c` is set to 1, it means the loop has found one such key `i` but not a second one yet. If no such key is found, `c` remains 0.
- **`a1`**: This variable can either remain `-1` (if no key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2` is found) or be set to the key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`.
- **`a2`**: This variable can either remain `-1` (if no second key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2` is found) or be set to the same key `i` as `a1`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state of the variables will be as described above.
