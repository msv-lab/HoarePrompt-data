Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where no two distinct numbers appear exactly `n//2` times. This means that if there are no pairs of distinct numbers that would allow Petya and Vasya to each take exactly half of the cards, the program incorrectly outputs "NO". 

For example, consider the input:

```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

In this case, Petya and Vasya can each choose a different pair of numbers (1 and 2, 1 and 3, or 2 and 3), allowing them to each take 3 cards. However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not find a pair of distinct numbers that each appear exactly 3 times. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
