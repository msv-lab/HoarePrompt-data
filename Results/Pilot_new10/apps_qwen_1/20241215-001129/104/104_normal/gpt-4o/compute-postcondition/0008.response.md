The code updates the value of `max_erase` by comparing it with `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 3 and `n` must be greater than 3, the value of `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1`. However, since the actual values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical value of `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1`. 

The only change in the state is that `max_erase` is now the maximum of its original value and `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `max_erase` is the maximum of its original value and `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1`**
