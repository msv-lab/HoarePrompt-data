To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given for loop and analyze the necessary conditions:

### For Loop Analysis
The for loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables and Conditions
1. **`j`**: The loop variable that will iterate over the range starting from `i + 1` up to `n + 1`.
2. **`i`**: The starting value of the loop variable `j`, which is initially set to 0 as per the given state.
3. **`n`**: The ending value of the loop variable `j`. It is specified that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `a` is a list of integers created from user input.
   - `max_erase` is 0 (though this variable does not directly affect the loop condition).

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will start when `j` is equal to `i + 1`, i.e., `j = 1`.
   - The loop will continue until `j` reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Condition for Execution**:
   - For the loop to start, `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is 0, the condition simplifies to `1 <= n + 1`, which further simplifies to `n >= 1`.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Additionally, we need to explicitly state the initial value of `i` for clarity.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
