Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `max_erase` is the maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) where \( j \) ranges from \( i + 1 \) to \( n + 1 \) and the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range `[i, j)`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `max_erase` also remains unchanged because it is determined based on the values of `i` and `j` during the loop execution, and these values will change as `i` changes.

6. **Final State**:
   - `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `a` is still a list of integers.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `max_erase` is still the maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) where \( j \) ranges from \( i + 1 \) to \( n + 1 \) and the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range `[i, j)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `max_erase` is the maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) where \( j \) ranges from \( i + 1 \) to \( n + 1 \) and the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range `[i, j)`**.
