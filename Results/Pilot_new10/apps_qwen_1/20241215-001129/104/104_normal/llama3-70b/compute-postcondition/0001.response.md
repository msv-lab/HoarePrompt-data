`a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes user input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and creates a list from those integers. Since the initial state of `n` is only that it is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and no other operations are performed on `n`, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is a list of integers created from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is a list of integers created from user input**
