According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the initial value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `j` starts from `i + 1`, which means `j` starts from 3. The condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\) for some \( j \geq 3 \).

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2,
- `j` is 3 (the starting point of the loop),
- `a` is a list of integers where the condition holds for all \( k \) in the range \([2, 3)\),
- `max_erase` is the precomputed maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) (updated to be the maximum of its current value and \( j - 3 \)).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so it becomes 4. The condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` should hold for all \( k \) in the range \([2, 4)\). Also, `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and \( 4 - 3 - 1 = 0 \), which does not change the value since `max_erase` was already updated to a non-negative value during the previous iterations.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers where the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\) for some \( j \geq 3 \), `i` is 2, `max_erase` is the precomputed maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) (updated to be the maximum of its current value and \( j - 4 \))**.
