Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers where the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\) for some \( j \geq 3\), `j` is 4, and `max_erase` is 1. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` holds, then the postcondition remains as specified. If the condition does not hold, the postcondition also remains the same as no changes are made in the else part.***
