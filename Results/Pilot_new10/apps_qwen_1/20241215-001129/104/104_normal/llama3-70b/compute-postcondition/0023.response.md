Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` must have at least one element beyond index 1.
   - `j` is 3.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (since `j` starts from `i + 1`, which is 2, and currently `j` is 3).
   - Therefore, the next value of `j` would be 4.

5. **Loop Condition Check:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `i + 1` to `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is 1 and `n` must be at least 2, `j` (which is now 4) should still be within this range if `n` is 3 or higher.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `a` must still have at least one element beyond index 1.
   - `j` is now 4.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` must have at least one element beyond index 1, `j` is 4**.
