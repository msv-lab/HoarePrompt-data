Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to ensure each skewer visits all 2n placements. Specifically, the program simply counts the number of positions where the permutation `p[i]` does not match `i + 1` and the number of zeros in the sequence `b`. However, this approach does not guarantee that each skewer will visit all 2n placements.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
1 0 0 0
```
In this case, the program would output 1 because there is only one change needed in `b` (changing `b[0]` from 1 to 0). However, this is not sufficient. The permutation `p` is already a valid permutation, and we need to ensure that each skewer visits all 2n placements. Here, the permutation `p` is already optimal, but we still need to flip at least one skewer (for example, flipping the first skewer would make it visit all placements).

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
