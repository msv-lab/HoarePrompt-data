`visited[x]` is assigned the value `True`. Since `x` must be 1, the dictionary `visited` now has the key `1` with the value `True`. The value of `x` itself is not affected and remains 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 1; `visited[1]` is `True`.

Output State: **`x` is 1; `visited[1]` is `True`**
