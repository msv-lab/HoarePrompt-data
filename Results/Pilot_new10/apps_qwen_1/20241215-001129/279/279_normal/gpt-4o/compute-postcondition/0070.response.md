Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of skewers), `p` (a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`), and `b` (a sequence of zeros and ones). It finds all cycles in the permutation `p` and counts the number of cycles where all corresponding elements in `b` are zeros. If there is only one cycle, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the count of such cycles unless the count is 0, in which case it prints 1.**
