The code `x = i` assigns the value of `i` to `x`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `x` will also be 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is an empty list, `visited` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is an empty list, and the current value of `i` is 0 and the element at index `i` in `visited` is still `False`.**
