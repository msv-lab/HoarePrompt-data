`visited[x]` is set to `True`. Given that `x` is initially 1 and the `visited` list is defined such that `visited[0]` is `False` and `visited[1]` is `False`, setting `visited[1]` to `True` changes its value from `False` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is 1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is an empty list, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `False`, the second element is `False`, and the rest are `True` with `visited[1]` set to `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the execution of the loop with the last cycle being `[1, 0]`, `cycle` is now `[1, 0]`**.
