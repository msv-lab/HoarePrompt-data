`x` is assigned the value of `p[x] - 1`. Since `p[x]` is not specified in the initial state, let's denote it as `p_value`. Therefore, `x` becomes `p_value - 1`. The states of the other variables (`visited` and `cycle`) are not affected.

Output State: **`visited[x]` is `True`; `cycle` contains `[x]`; `x` is `p[x] - 1`**
