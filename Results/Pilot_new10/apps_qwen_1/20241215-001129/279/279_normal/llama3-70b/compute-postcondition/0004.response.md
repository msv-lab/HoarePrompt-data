According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `n` will always be greater than 0, ensuring the loop can execute.

The other variables (`p`, `b`, and `ans`) do not affect the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, we do not need to adjust their states for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)**
