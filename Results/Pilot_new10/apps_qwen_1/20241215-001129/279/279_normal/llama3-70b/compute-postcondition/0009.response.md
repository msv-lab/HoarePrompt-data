`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and the conditions for `ans` in relation to the array `p` and the array `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `ans` is 1 more than its original value, `ans` is 1 if the element at index `i` of the array `p` is not equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `ans` has no change. `b[i]` is currently 0.
