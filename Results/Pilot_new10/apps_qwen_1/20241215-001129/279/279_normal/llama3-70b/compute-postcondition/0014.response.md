The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial state is that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `i` is \(k + 1\), and `ans` is increased by 1 if `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. After executing `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `i` is \(k + 1\), and `ans` is the original value plus 1.**
