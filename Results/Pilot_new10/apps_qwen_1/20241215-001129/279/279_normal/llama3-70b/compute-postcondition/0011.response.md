Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `ans` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` of the array `p` is not equal to `i + 1` and `b[i]` is currently 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `p[i] != i + 1` and `b[i] == 0`.
   - If both conditions are true, `ans` is incremented by 1.

3. **State Adjustments for Next Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the state after the current iteration of the loop to decide if the loop should continue or not.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know the value of `i` and `ans`.

4. **Key Points:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i = i + 1`).

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i < n`, the loop will continue if `i < n - 1`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

6. **Final State:**
   - The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
     - `n` remains the same as it did not change within the loop.
     - `i` is incremented by 1.
     - `ans` remains unchanged unless the new `i` satisfies the conditions to increment `ans`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

So, if `i` was `k` before the iteration, then after the iteration `i` will be `k + 1`.

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `i` is \(k + 1\) where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
