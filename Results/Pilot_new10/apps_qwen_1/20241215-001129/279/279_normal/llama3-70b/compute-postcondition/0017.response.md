`ans` is incremented by 1. The original value of `ans` is the original value plus 1 because `b[i]` is 0. Since `i` is `k + 2`, this does not affect the value of `ans` directly but indicates the context in which `ans` was incremented. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `i` is \(k + 2\), and `ans` is the original value plus 2 because `b[i]` is 0.**
