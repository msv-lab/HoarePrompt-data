`ans` is incremented by 1, increasing its value by 1. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and `i` is \(k + 1\), where `k` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration. The value of `ans` remains unchanged before this operation.

After executing `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` is updated, but the exact value of `ans` is not specified in the initial state. The value of `n` and the relationship between `i` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `i` is \(k + 1\), and `ans` is increased by 1.**
