You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to ensure each skewer visits all 2n placements. Specifically, the program simply counts the number of positions where the permutation `p[i]` does not match `i + 1` and the number of zeros in the sequence `b`. However, this approach does not guarantee that each skewer will visit all 2n placements.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
1 0 0 0
```
In this case, the program would output 1 because there is only one change needed in `b` (changing `b[0]` from 1 to 0). However, this is not sufficient. The permutation `p` is already a valid permutation, and we need to ensure that each skewer visits all 2n placements. Here, the permutation `p` is already optimal, but we still need to flip at least one skewer (for example, flipping the first skewer would make it visit all placements).

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and b is a sequence of n integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `ans` is the count of indices `i` where either `p[i] != i + 1` or `b[i] == 0`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three inputs `n`, `p`, and `b` and returns the count of indices where the permutation `p` is not in its natural order (i.e., `p[i] != i + 1`) or the sequence `b` contains a 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
