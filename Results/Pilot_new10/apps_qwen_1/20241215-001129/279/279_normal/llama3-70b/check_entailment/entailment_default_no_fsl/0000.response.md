Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code only counts the number of positions where the permutation `p` is not in its natural order (i.e., `p[i] != i + 1`) and the number of zeros in the sequence `b`. However, this does not guarantee that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
2 3 4 1
0 0 0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

This is because we need to change the permutation to something like `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and keep `b` as `[0, 0, 0, 0]` to ensure each skewer visits all 8 placements. The current code would incorrectly return `0` because `p` is almost in its natural order, and all elements in `b` are `0`.

The correct solution requires more complex logic to ensure that every skewer can visit all placements, possibly involving cycles and reversing operations. The current implementation does not account for these requirements.
