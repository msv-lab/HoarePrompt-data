Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment was accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program only records operations when at least one of the four adjacent cells in a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix is 1. This logic does not cover the case where only three out of the four elements in a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are 1 and the fourth needs to be set to 1. As illustrated in the example provided:

For the input:
```
2 2
1 1
1 0
```
The program outputs `-1`, indicating it cannot achieve the transformation, even though a single operation can make matrix \( B \) equal to matrix \( A \). Therefore, the program fails to handle this specific scenario, making the original assessment correct.
