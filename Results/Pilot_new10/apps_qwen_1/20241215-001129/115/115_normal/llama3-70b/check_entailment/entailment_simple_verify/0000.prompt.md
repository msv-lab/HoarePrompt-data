You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

-1

-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) in all cases. Specifically, the program checks if all four elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are already 1 before performing an operation. However, this approach misses the case where only three out of the four elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are 1, and the fourth element needs to be set to 1 to match the target matrix \( A \).

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 2
1 1
1 0
```
The program would output:
```
-1
```
But it is possible to make matrix \( B \) equal to matrix \( A \) with just one operation:
```
1 1
```
This operation sets \( B_{1,1} \), \( B_{1,2} \), \( B_{2,1} \), and \( B_{2,2} \) to 1, making \( B \) equal to \( A \).

Therefore, the program fails to handle cases where only three elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are 1, leading to incorrect results.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: $n$ and $m$ are positive integers such that $2 \le n, m \le 50$, and $A$ is a $n \times m$ matrix where each element is either $0$ or $1$.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][
                j + 1] == 1:
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1
                ] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `ops` is a list containing all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for each position \((i, j)\) in the matrix \(A\) that satisfy the condition \(A[i][j] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) or \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\), `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
    if (len(ops) > 2500) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ops` is a list of tuples representing positions in the matrix \(A\) that satisfy the given conditions; `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1; `op[0]` and `op[1]` are the first and second elements of a tuple in `ops`, respectively.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`ops` is a list of tuples representing positions in the matrix \(A\) that satisfy the given conditions. `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2. `m` is an integer between 2 and 50. `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1. If `len(ops) > 2500`, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the list `ops` remains unchanged.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
