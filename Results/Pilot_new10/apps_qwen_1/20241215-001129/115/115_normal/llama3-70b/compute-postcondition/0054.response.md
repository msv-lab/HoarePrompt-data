According to the given for loop, the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-2`. The loop body is omitted, but we know that the condition for continuing the loop is based on the value of `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state remains unchanged, and `ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` if any of the following conditions are met for the current `i` and `j`:
- `A[i][j] == 1`
- `A[i + 1][j] == 1`
- `A[i][j + 1] == 1`
- `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m-1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

Let's assume the state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `i` is some value (let's call it `k`)
- `j` is `m-2` (since the loop ends when `j` reaches `m-2`)
- `ops` contains tuples based on the conditions mentioned above

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `m-1`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is `k`, `j` is `m-1`, and `ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` if any of the specified conditions are met for the current `i` and `j`**.

To put it succinctly:

State: **`i` is `k`, `j` is `m-1`, and `ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` if `A[i][j] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j] == 1` or `A[i][j + 1] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`**.
