The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not modify the values of any variables. Given the initial state, the values of `j` and the elements in `A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 0; `A` contains at least one element such that \(A[i][j] == 1\) and \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) and \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) and \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\)**
