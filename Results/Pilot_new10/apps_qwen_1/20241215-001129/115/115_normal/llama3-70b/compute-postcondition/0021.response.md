Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each position `(i, j)` in the matrix that satisfies the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, and the loop will have executed exactly `m - 1` times for each row `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `m - 1` times for each row `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- During each iteration, if the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is satisfied, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is appended to the list `ops`.
- After all iterations, `i` will have incremented to `n` since the loop increments `i` after each row is processed.
- The condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` ensures that all positions satisfying this condition are recorded in `ops`.
- The loop will not execute if `n` is less than 2, in which case `i` would never reach `n`, and `ops` would remain an empty list.
