Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(1, 1)]`, and the condition `(A[0][j] == 1 or A[1][j] == 1 or A[0][j + 1] == 1 or (A[1][j + 1] == 1))` holds for `j = j_end + 1`. If `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true, no changes occur. If the condition is false, no changes occur as well.***
