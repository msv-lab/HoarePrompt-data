The code snippet prints `-1`. This means the value of `ops` remains unchanged, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `A` also remain unchanged since no operations are performed on them within the given code. The print statement does not affect the variables but only outputs `-1`.

Output State: **`ops` is a list containing all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for each position \((i, j)\) in the matrix \(A\) that satisfy the condition \(A[i][j] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) or \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\), `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1; `-1` is printed.**
