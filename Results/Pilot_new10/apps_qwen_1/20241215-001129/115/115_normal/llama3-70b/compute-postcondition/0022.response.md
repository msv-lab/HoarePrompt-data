According to the code, the loop iterates over rows `i` from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive). The loop will have executed exactly `m - 1` times for each row `i` from `0` to `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is `n-1` (since the loop ran for `n-1` rows)
- `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each position `(i, j)` in the matrix that satisfies the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop needs to start with `i` being `n-2` because the loop will iterate over rows `i` from `0` to `n-2`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each position `(i, j)` in the matrix that satisfies the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`**
