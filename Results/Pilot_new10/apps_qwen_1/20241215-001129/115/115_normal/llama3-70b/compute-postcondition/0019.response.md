`ops` is a list that appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, and the condition for appending the tuple does not depend on the values of `i` and `j` since it only checks if the elements in the matrix meet a certain condition. Since the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is not specified to be true or false, we cannot change the postcondition based on this. Therefore, the only change is the addition of the tuple to the list `ops`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(1, 1), (i + 1, j + 1)]`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**
