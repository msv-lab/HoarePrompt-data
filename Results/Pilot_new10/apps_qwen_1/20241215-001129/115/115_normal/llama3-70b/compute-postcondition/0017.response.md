The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop and proceed with the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(1, 1)]`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**
