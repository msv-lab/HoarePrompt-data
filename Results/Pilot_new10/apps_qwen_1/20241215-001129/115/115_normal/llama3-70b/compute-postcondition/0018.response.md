Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(1, 1)]`, and `j` is `j + 1`. If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If the condition is false, the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.***
