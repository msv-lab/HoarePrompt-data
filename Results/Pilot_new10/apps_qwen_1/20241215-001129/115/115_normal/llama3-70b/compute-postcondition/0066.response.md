The given code snippet is:
```python
print(op[0], op[1])
```
Let's analyze the impact of this code step by step:

1. The `op` variable is assumed to be a non-empty list containing at least one tuple.
2. The code `print(op[0], op[1])` will print the first and second elements of the tuple stored in `op[0]`.

Since `op` is a non-empty list and contains at least one tuple, we can safely assume that `op[0]` is a tuple with at least two elements. The values of these elements will be printed.

However, the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty list (at least one tuple exists in the list); `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1; `op[0]` is a tuple and its first and second elements are printed.**
