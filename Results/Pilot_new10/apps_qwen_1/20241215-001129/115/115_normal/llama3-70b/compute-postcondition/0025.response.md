The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet and no variables were altered, the state of the variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`A` is a matrix, `i` and `j` are indices within the matrix `A`. The value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, the value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and the value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1**
