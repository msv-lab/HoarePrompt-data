Output State: **`ops` is a list of tuples representing positions in the matrix \(A\) that satisfy the given conditions; `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1; `op[0]` and `op[1]` are the first and second elements of a tuple in `ops`, respectively.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** 
  - `ops` contains all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for each position \((i, j)\) in the matrix \(A\) that satisfy the condition \(A[i][j] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) or \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\).
  - `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2.
  - `m` is an integer between 2 and 50.
  - `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop iterates over each tuple in `ops`.
  - For each iteration, the first and second elements of the tuple are printed.

- **Final State After Loop Execution:**
  - Since the loop prints each tuple in `ops`, by the end of the loop, the `ops` list remains unchanged.
  - The values of `n`, `m`, and `A` also remain unchanged because the loop does not modify these variables.
  - The printed output consists of pairs of integers, which are the first and second elements of the tuples in `ops`.

- **Case When Loop Does Not Execute:**
  - If the loop does not execute, it means `ops` is an empty list. In this case, `n`, `m`, and `A` still retain their initial values, but no tuples are printed.

Thus, the final state after the loop executes any number of times is that `ops` is a list of tuples representing positions in the matrix \(A\) that satisfy the given conditions, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged.
