The code creates an `n x m` matrix `A` by taking input values and converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the values of `n` and `m` are taken from the input, and the matrix `A` is populated with the subsequent inputs.

Given the initial state where `n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, and `A` is an `n x m` matrix with elements either 0 or 1, the code does not alter the values of `n` and `m`, but it updates the matrix `A`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` and the contents of `A` depend on the user's input, which is not specified here, we can only state that `n` and `m` remain unchanged and `A` is now an `n x m` matrix filled with 0s and 1s.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `A` is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.**
