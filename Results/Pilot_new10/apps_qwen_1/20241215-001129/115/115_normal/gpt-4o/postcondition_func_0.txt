The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 50) and `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1). The function iterates through `A` to identify 2x2 blocks of 1s and updates corresponding positions in `B` to 1. After updating, it checks if `A` and `B` match. If they do not match, it returns -1. If they match, it prints the length of the operations list and each operation (coordinates of the 2x2 blocks). In all cases, the function returns -1 if there is any mismatch.
