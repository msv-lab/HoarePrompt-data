Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop in question uses `j` as the loop variable. The loop runs for `m - 1` iterations.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `n` must be the same (though its value isn't specified).

4. **Determine the Initial Value of `j`**:
   - The loop variable `j` is initialized to 0 by default when using `range(m - 1)`.

5. **Check the Condition for the First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute even once, `j` must be less than `m`.

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to 0 and that `j < m` holds true for at least one iteration. Since `j` is initialized to 0 by default, we only need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` is already set to `n-2`.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - We need to ensure `m > 0` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state should be:

State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be the same, `m` must be greater than 0**
