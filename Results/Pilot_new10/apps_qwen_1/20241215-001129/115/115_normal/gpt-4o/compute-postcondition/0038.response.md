Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `n` must be the same (no change needed for `n`)
   - `m` must be greater than 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `m-2`. This means `j` starts from `0` and goes up to `m-2`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2` and `j` was `n-3` (since the loop condition is `range(m-1)`).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `n-2`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` remains the same (`n-2`).
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `m` remains greater than 0.
   - `j` changes from `n-3` to `n-2`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be the same, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-2`**.
