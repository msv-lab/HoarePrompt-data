State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` must be 0, `m` must be at least 3**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The for loop statement is `for j in range(m - 1):`.
2. For the loop to execute, the expression `m - 1` must be at least 1 because the `range()` function in Python generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, the given end value.
3. Therefore, `m - 1 >= 1` simplifies to `m >= 2`.
4. Since `j` is the loop variable that starts iterating from 0 (as per the default behavior of `range()`), `j` must be 0 at the start of the loop.
5. Given the initial state `n` must be at least 2, this condition is already satisfied as part of ensuring the loop can run. Thus, we don't need to adjust `n` further.

Combining these points, the required adjustments are:
- `j` must be 0.
- `m` must be at least 3 to ensure `m - 1` is at least 1.
