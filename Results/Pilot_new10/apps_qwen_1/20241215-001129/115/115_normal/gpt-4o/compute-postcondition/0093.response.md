The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 50, and `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. In all cases described, the function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, and `A` and return -1 in all cases.
