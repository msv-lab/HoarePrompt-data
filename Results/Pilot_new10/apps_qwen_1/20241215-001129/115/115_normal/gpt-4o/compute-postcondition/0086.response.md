According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `operations`. The loop will execute if `operations` is not an empty list. 

Before the loop starts, we know:
- `A` is a 2D list of integers.
- `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1.
- `operations` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B`.
- `n` is the same as the initial value.
- `m` is the same as the initial value.
- The output of the print function is the length of `operations`.

For the loop to execute, `operations` must contain at least one tuple. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `operations` is not empty.

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1, `operations` is a non-empty list of tuples, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value, the output of the print function is the length of `operations`**
