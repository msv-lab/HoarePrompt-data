Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` must be 1, `m` must be at least 3. If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is true, then `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1` and `operations = [(i + 1, j + 1)]`. Otherwise, the values of `B` and `operations` remain unchanged.**
