`B[i][j]` is set to 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is set to 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is set to 1, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is set to 1. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i_end + 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`, `m` must be greater than 1; `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`, `m` must be greater than 1; `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.**
