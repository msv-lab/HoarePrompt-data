Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the given states are:
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `j` must be 0
   - `m` must be at least 3

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in `range(m - 1)`. This means the loop will run from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2`.

3. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 0.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1.

5. **Conditions to Check**: The loop will continue to run as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

6. **Updated States**:
   - `j` will be 1 (since it was 0 and we incremented it by 1)
   - `n` and `m` should still meet their initial conditions (`n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 3)

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` must be 1, `m` must be at least 3**
