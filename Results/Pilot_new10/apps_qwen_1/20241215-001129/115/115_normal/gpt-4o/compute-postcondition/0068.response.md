Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - \(i\), \(j\), \(n\), \(m\), \(A\), \(B\), and \(operations\) retain their initial states.
   - \(A[i][j]\) remains equal to \(B[i][j]\).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over \(j\) from 0 to \(m-1\).

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - \(i\), \(j\), \(n\), \(m\), \(A\), \(B\), and \(operations\) remain unchanged from their initial states.
   - \(A[i][j]\) remains equal to \(B[i][j]\).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, \(j\) must be less than \(m\). Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, \(j\) was \(m-1\).
   - To enter the next iteration, \(j\) needs to be incremented by 1, making it \(m\).

5. **Adjusted States:**
   - \(i\) remains unchanged.
   - \(j\) increases by 1, so it becomes \(m\).
   - \(n\), \(m\), \(A\), \(B\), and \(operations\) remain unchanged.
   - \(A[i][j]\) must still be equal to \(B[i][j]\) to avoid returning -1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` retains its initial state, `j` is `m`, `n` retains its initial state, `m` retains its initial state, `A` retains its initial state, `B` retains its initial state, `operations` retains its initial state, and `A[i][j]` must be equal to `B[i][j]`.**
