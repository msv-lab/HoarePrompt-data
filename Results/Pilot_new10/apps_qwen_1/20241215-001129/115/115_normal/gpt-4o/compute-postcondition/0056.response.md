Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - \( i \), \( j \), \( n \), \( m \), \( A \), \( B \), and \( operations \) maintain their initial states.
   - The condition for returning -1 is if \( A[i][j] \neq B[i][j] \).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs over \( j \) from 0 to \( m-1 \).
   - For the loop to continue executing, \( j \) must be less than \( m \).

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - We know that at the end of the previous iteration, \( i \) and \( j \) are in their initial states, and \( j \) is one less than its value at the start of the current iteration.
   - Therefore, if \( j \) was \( k \) at the start of the current iteration, then at the end of the iteration, \( j = k + 1 \).

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( j \) must be less than \( m \).
   - Since \( j \) increases by 1 at each iteration, the new value of \( j \) is \( j + 1 \).

5. **Maintaining Other States:**
   - \( i \), \( n \), \( m \), \( A \), \( B \), and \( operations \) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.

Based on these steps, we can conclude:

- \( i \) remains in its initial state.
- \( j \) becomes \( j + 1 \).
- \( n \) remains in its initial state.
- \( m \) remains in its initial state.
- \( A \) remains in its initial state.
- \( B \) remains in its initial state.
- \( operations \) remains in its initial state.

Since the only state that changes is \( j \), and it must be less than \( m \) for the loop to continue, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i`, `j` is \( j + 1 \), `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, `operations` maintain their initial states.**

So, the final state is:

State: **`i`, `j` is \( j + 1 \), `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, `operations` maintain their initial states.**
