Let's analyze the loop and the provided output states step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `0` to `m-1`. For each iteration, it checks if `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`. If any such pair is found, the function immediately returns `-1`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the function returns `None`.

### Initial Values and Loop Execution
- Initial state: `i = n-1`, `j = m-1`, `n` and `m` are as initially set, `A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of the same dimensions initialized to 0s, `operations` is an empty list, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.

### Output States
- After 1 iteration (`j` is `0`): `i` remains `n-1`, `j` becomes `0`, `A[i][j]` is checked, and if it matches `B[i][j]`, `A[i][j]` is updated to 1.
- After 2 iterations (`j` is `0` and `1`): `i` remains `n-1`, `j` becomes `1`, `A[i][j]` is checked, and if it matches `B[i][j]`, `A[i][j]` is updated to 1.
- After 3 iterations: `i` remains `n-1`, `j` remains `1`, `A[i][j]` is checked, and if it matches `B[i][j]`, `A[i][j]` is updated to 1.

### General Pattern
- The loop checks each column `j` from `0` to `m-1` starting from row `i = n-1`.
- If any `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns `-1` immediately.
- If all elements `A[i][j]` match `B[i][j]` for all `j` in the range, the function continues without returning anything.

### Final Output State
- Since the loop iterates through all columns `j` from `0` to `m-1`, and if it finds no mismatches, it will eventually check all elements in the last row `i = n-1`.
- If there is no mismatch, `A[i][j]` will be 1 for all `j` in the range from `0` to `m-1`.
- If there is a mismatch at any point, the function returns `-1`.

### Conclusion
After all iterations of the loop have executed, the final state will be:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-1`
- `n` and `m` are the same as the initial values
- `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element `A[n-1][j]` is 1 for all `j` from `0` to `m-1` if there were no mismatches.
- `B` is a 2D list of the same dimensions where each element `B[n-1][j]` is 1 for all `j` from `0` to `m-1` if there were no mismatches.
- `operations` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B` according to the conditions specified in the loop.
- No further updates can be made since the loop has finished executing.
- `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` for all `j` from `0` to `m-1`.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element `A[n-1][j]` is 1 for all `j` from `0` to `m-1` if there were no mismatches, `B` is a 2D list of the same dimensions where each element `B[n-1][j]` is 1 for all `j` from `0` to `m-1` if there were no mismatches, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B` according to the conditions specified in the loop, and no further updates can be made since the loop has finished executing, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` for all `j` from `0` to `m-1`.**
