Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem statement:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the matrices.
   - It initializes the matrix \( A \) by parsing the input values.

2. **Matrix Transformation Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the matrix \( A \) to identify regions where all four elements of a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are 1s.
   - For each such region, it sets the corresponding elements in matrix \( B \) to 1 and records the operation in the `operations` list.
   - This ensures that only the necessary operations are performed to match \( A \) with \( B \).

3. **Validation:**
   - After performing the operations, the program checks if \( A \) and \( B \) are identical.
   - If they are not identical, it returns -1 indicating that it is impossible to transform \( B \) into \( A \).
   - If they are identical, it prints the number of operations and the coordinates of the operations performed.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is consistent with the problem statement, printing the number of operations followed by the coordinates of each operation.

Since the program correctly reads the input, performs the required operations, validates the result, and outputs the correct format, it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
