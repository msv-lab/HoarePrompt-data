Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in its approach to transforming matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \). Specifically, the program checks if all four elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix of \( A \) are \( 1 \) before setting the corresponding elements in \( B \) to \( 1 \). However, this approach fails to account for scenarios where individual elements in \( A \) need to be set to \( 1 \) without the surrounding elements also being \( 1 \).

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

The program will not be able to transform \( B \) into \( A \) because it requires all four elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix to be \( 1 \) to perform an operation, but in this case, there are no such \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices where all elements are \( 1 \). Therefore, the program will return \(-1\), which is the correct output for this case. However, the program does not handle the scenario where individual elements need to be set to \( 1 \) without the surrounding elements also being \( 1 \).

Since the program does not handle all possible cases correctly, it is considered incorrect.
