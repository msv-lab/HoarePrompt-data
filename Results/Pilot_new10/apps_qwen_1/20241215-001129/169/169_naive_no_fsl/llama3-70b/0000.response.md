Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the initial number of stones in the pile is negative. Specifically, the program only checks if the count of '-' (remove stone) operations is greater than the count of '+' (add stone) operations and prints 0 if true. However, the problem description does not specify the initial number of stones, and it implies that the initial number of stones could be any non-negative integer. 

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
---
```

According to the problem description, if Vasya started with 3 stones, after performing the operations, the number of stones would be 0. However, the program will output 0 regardless of the initial number of stones, which does not account for the initial condition properly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
