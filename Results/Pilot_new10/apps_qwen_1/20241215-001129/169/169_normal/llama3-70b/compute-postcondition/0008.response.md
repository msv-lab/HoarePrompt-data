Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "-" and "+" symbols, `minus_count` is the count of '-' symbols in `s`, `plus_count` is the count of '+' symbols in `s`. If `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`, the program does nothing. Otherwise, the output of the print statement is `plus_count - minus_count`.***
