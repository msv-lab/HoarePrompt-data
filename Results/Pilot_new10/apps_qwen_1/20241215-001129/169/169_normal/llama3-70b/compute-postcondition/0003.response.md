The code counts the number of '+' symbols in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `plus_count`. The `minus_count` is already defined as the count of '-' symbols in `s`, and the length of `s` is `n`.

After executing the line `plus_count = s.count('+')`, the value of `plus_count` will be the number of '+' symbols in `s`. The `n` and `minus_count` variables remain unchanged.

Let's denote the number of '+' symbols in `s` as `p`. Therefore, `plus_count` will be `p`, and `minus_count` will be `n - p` since the total length of `s` is `n` and it consists only of '+' and '-' symbols.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "-" and "+" symbols, `minus_count` is the count of '-' symbols in `s`, `plus_count` is the count of '+' symbols in `s`**
