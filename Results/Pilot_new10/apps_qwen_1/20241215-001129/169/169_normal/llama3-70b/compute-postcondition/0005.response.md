The code `print(0)` simply prints the number 0 to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "-" and "+" symbols, `minus_count` is the count of '-' symbols in `s`, `plus_count` is the count of '+' symbols in `s`, and `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`.**
