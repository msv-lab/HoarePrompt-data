Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of operations.
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` containing only '-' and '+' characters, where '-' indicates taking a stone and '+' indicates adding a stone.

2. **State Initialization**:
   - A variable `stones` is initialized to 0, representing the current number of stones in the pile.

3. **Operation Execution**:
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`. For each character:
     - If the character is '+', it increments the `stones` counter.
     - If the character is '-', it decrements the `stones` counter but ensures it does not go below 0 (since the pile cannot be empty before any '-' operation).

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all operations, the program prints the value of `stones`.

### Why It Meets the Problem Description:
- **Initial State and Constraints**: The program correctly handles the initial state of the pile being non-empty before any '-' operation. This is ensured by the logic that prevents `stones` from going below 0.
- **Final State Calculation**: The final count of stones (`stones`) after processing all operations directly corresponds to the minimal possible number of stones in the pile, as it accounts for all additions and subtractions while maintaining the non-empty constraint.
- **Correct Output**: The program prints the minimal possible number of stones, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

### Example Verification:
- **Example 1**: Input `3 ---` -> Output `0`. The pile starts with at least 3 stones, and after 3 '-' operations, the pile is empty.
- **Example 2**: Input `4 ++++` -> Output `4`. Starting with 0 stones, 4 '+' operations result in 4 stones.
- **Example 3**: Input `2 -+` -> Output `1`. Starting with 1 stone, 1 '-' followed by 1 '+' results in 1 stone.
- **Example 4**: Input `5 ++-++` -> Output `3`. Starting with 0 stones, 2 '+' followed by 1 '-' and 2 '+' results in 3 stones.

Since the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
