Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' and '+' characters.
- `stones` is either 1 if `operation` is '+', or 0 if `operation` is '-'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for operation in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' and '+' characters.
- `stones` is either 1 if `operation` is '+', or 0 if `operation` is '-'.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `s`.

2. **Current State:**
   - We know `s` is a string of length `n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `operation` is the character processed in the last iteration.
   - Therefore, the remaining string `s` is one character shorter than the original `s`.

3. **Update States:**
   - Since one character has been processed, the length of the string `s` is now `n-1`.
   - The variable `operation` is now set to the current character being processed in this iteration.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `n` (the length of `s`) is reduced by 1, so it is now `n-1`.
- `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the last character processed in the previous iteration.
- `stones` remains the same based on the current `operation`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of '-' and '+' characters, and `stones` is either 1 if `operation` is '+', or 0 if `operation` is '-'**.
