The code `print(stones)` simply prints the value of the variable `stones`. This does not change the value of `stones` or any other variable; it only outputs the current value of `stones`. The initial state remains unchanged except that the value of `stones` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the original length of the string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' and '+' characters (after removing all operations), and `stones` is the net count of '+' operations minus the net count of '-' operations performed on the string `s`; the value of `stones` is printed.**
