The code updates the value of `stones` to be the maximum of 0 and `stones - 1`. Given the initial state where `stones` is 0, the expression `stones - 1` evaluates to `-1`. Taking the maximum of 0 and `-1` results in 0. Therefore, the value of `stones` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' and '+' characters, `stones` is 0, `operation` is '-', and the operation is not '+'**
