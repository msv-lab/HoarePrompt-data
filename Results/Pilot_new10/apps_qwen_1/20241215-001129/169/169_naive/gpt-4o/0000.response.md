Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It initializes `stones` to 0 and iterates through the string `s`, incrementing `stones` for each `'+'` and decrementing it (with a minimum value of 0) for each `'-'`. This approach ensures that the pile never becomes negative, adhering to the requirement that the pile cannot be empty before a `'-'` operation. Given the constraints and examples, the program handles all cases appropriately, making it correct.
