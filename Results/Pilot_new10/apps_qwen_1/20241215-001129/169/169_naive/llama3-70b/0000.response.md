Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial number of stones is negative or zero, which is a potential edge case. According to the problem description, the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. However, the program calculates the minimal possible number of stones directly without considering the initial state of the pile. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input
3
---
Output
0
```

In this case, if Vasya starts with 1 stone, the output should be 0. But if Vasya starts with 0 stones, the output should also be 0. However, since the program does not account for the initial number of stones, it may produce incorrect results for inputs where the initial number of stones is zero. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
