Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the while loop and the `func_2` function do not properly handle the scenario where \(a\) and \(b\) are already coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). In such cases, incrementing \(k\) will not necessarily lead to the smallest possible least common multiple (LCM).

For example, consider the input:
```
5 7
```
- When \(k = 0\), the LCM of \(5 + 0\) and \(7 + 0\) is \(35\).
- When \(k = 1\), the LCM of \(5 + 1\) and \(7 + 1\) is \(24\).
- When \(k = 2\), the LCM of \(5 + 2\) and \(7 + 2\) is \(33\).
- When \(k = 3\), the LCM of \(5 + 3\) and \(7 + 3\) is \(28\).
- When \(k = 4\), the LCM of \(5 + 4\) and \(7 + 4\) is \(27\).
- When \(k = 5\), the LCM of \(5 + 5\) and \(7 + 5\) is \(35\).

The smallest LCM is achieved when \(k = 1\), but the program does not reach this point because it increments \(k\) until the LCM is no longer smaller than the initial value. Since the program does not correctly handle the coprime case and other edge cases, it fails to find the optimal \(k\) for certain inputs.
