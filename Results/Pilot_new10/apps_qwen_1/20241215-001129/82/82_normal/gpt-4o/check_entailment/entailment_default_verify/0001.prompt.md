You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split()
    a = int(data[0])
    b = int(data[1])
    print(func_3(a, b))

def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)

def func_3(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
    return min_k


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The program uses `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and `func_2` to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) using the relationship between GCD and LCM. This part is correct.

2. **Optimization Strategy**: The program calculates the difference between \( a \) and \( b \) and iterates over possible values of \( k \) up to the square root of this difference. For each candidate \( k \), it calculates the new values \( a' = (a + k - 1) // k * k \) and \( b' = (b + k - 1) // k * k \). These calculations ensure that \( a' \) and \( b' \) are multiples of \( k \), making the LCM calculation straightforward.

3. **Minimizing LCM**: The program keeps track of the minimum LCM found and updates the corresponding \( k \) value. This ensures that the smallest \( k \) is chosen when multiple \( k \) values result in the same minimal LCM.

Given these points, the program correctly handles all the examples provided and does not exhibit any errors or omissions in the logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After the loop terminates, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. This is achieved through the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. 

Output hint for function_2: The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, multiplies them, and returns the result. 

Output hint for function_3: The function `func_3` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). If `a` equals `b`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it finds the smallest value `min_k` that, when added to both `a` and `b`, results in numbers that are multiples of `min_k` and returns this `min_k` as it minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of the adjusted `a` and `b`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
