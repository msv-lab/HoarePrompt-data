Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to consider the case where `a` and `b` are consecutive integers (i.e., `abs(a - b) == 1`). In such cases, the optimal `k` is not being correctly determined.

For example, consider the input:
```
Input
2 3

Output
1
```

According to the problem description, for `a = 2` and `b = 3`, the optimal `k` should be 1 because:
- For `k = 0`: The LCM of `2 + 0` and `3 + 0` is LCM(2, 3) = 6.
- For `k = 1`: The LCM of `2 + 1` and `3 + 1` is LCM(3, 4) = 12.
- For `k = 2`: The LCM of `2 + 2` and `3 + 2` is LCM(4, 5) = 20.

The smallest LCM is obtained when `k = 0`, but the code incorrectly sets `min_k` to 1 due to the loop condition and the way the `new_a` and `new_b` values are calculated.

The code should ensure that when `a` and `b` are consecutive, it correctly identifies `k = 0` as the optimal solution. The current implementation does not handle this edge case properly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
