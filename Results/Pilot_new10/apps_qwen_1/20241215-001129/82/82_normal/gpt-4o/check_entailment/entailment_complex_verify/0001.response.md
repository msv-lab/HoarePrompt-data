Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the program appears to be correct. The annotations align with the logic described in the original assessment:

1. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly compute the GCD and LCM, respectively.
2. **Optimization Strategy**: The main function `func_3` correctly iterates over possible values of \( k \) up to the square root of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \). It ensures that the new values \( a' \) and \( b' \) are multiples of \( k \), which simplifies the LCM calculation.
3. **Minimizing LCM**: The program effectively finds the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \).

The annotated version confirms that the program correctly handles the problem as described in the problem statement and the original assessment was accurate.
