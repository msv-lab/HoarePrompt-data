Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for finding the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Handling Equal Values**: If \( a \) equals \( b \), the LCM is trivially 0, so the code correctly returns 0.

2. **Finding the Minimum LCM**: For the case where \( a \neq b \), the code iterates over possible values of \( k \) from 1 to the square root of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \). It checks each \( k \) to see if adding \( k \) to both \( a \) and \( b \) makes them multiples of \( k \). If so, it calculates the LCM of the adjusted values using the helper functions `func_1` (which computes the GCD) and `func_2` (which computes the LCM using the GCD).

3. **Minimizing LCM**: The code ensures that it keeps track of the smallest \( k \) that results in the minimum LCM. It correctly updates `min_k` if a smaller \( k \) yields a smaller or equal LCM.

Given these steps, the code handles all described cases correctly and adheres to the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or examples where the code would fail according to the provided hints and problem constraints.
