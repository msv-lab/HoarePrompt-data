Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **GCD and LCM Functions (`func_1` and `func_2`)**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The `func_2` function correctly computes the LCM using the relationship between LCM and GCD.

2. **Optimal \( k \) Search (`func_3`)**:
   - The function `func_3` iterates through possible values of \( k \) from 1 up to the square root of the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \).
   - For each \( k \), it calculates the next multiple of \( k \) greater than or equal to \( a + k \) and \( b + k \).
   - It then checks if the LCM of these multiples is smaller than the current minimum LCM found. If so, it updates the minimum LCM and corresponding \( k \).

The provided output hints accurately describe the behavior of each function:
- `func_1` returns the GCD of two integers.
- `func_2` returns the LCM of two integers.
- `func_3` finds the optimal \( k \) that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \).

Given that the program handles edge cases correctly, such as when \( a \) and \( b \) are equal (returning 0), and efficiently searches for the optimal \( k \), the original assessment is accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.
