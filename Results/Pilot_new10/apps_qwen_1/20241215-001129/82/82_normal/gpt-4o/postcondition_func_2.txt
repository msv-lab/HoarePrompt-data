The function `func_3` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). If `a` equals `b`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it finds the smallest value `min_k` that, when added to both `a` and `b`, results in numbers that are multiples of `min_k` and returns this `min_k` as it minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of the adjusted `a` and `b`.
