Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step to determine the output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State Recap
- `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\).
- `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\).
- `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and must be a perfect square.
- `min_lcm` is infinity (`float('inf')`).
- `min_k` is `0`.
- `k` is `1`.
- `diff` is divisible by `k`.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]` and updates `min_lcm` and `min_k` based on the conditions specified.

#### Key Steps Inside the Loop
1. For each `candidate` in `[k, diff // k]`:
   - Calculate `new_a` and `new_b` using the formula: \((x + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\).
   - Compute `current_lcm` using the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
   - Update `min_lcm` and `min_k` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`).

### Understanding the Loop Execution
- The loop will iterate at least twice because it checks both `k` and `diff // k`.
- After each iteration, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated based on the minimum `lcm` found so far.

### Final Output State
After all iterations of the loop, the final state of the variables will be:
- `a` and `b` remain their original values since they are not modified within the loop.
- `diff` remains the same as it is only used for calculating `k` and `diff // k`.
- `k` and `diff // k` will be checked, and one of them (the one that results in the smallest `lcm`) will be stored in `min_k`.
- `min_lcm` will store the smallest `lcm` found during the loop iterations.

### Output State
Output State: **`a` is its original value, `b` is its original value, `diff` is its original value, `k` and `diff // k` are the factors of `diff` such that the smallest `lcm` is found and stored in `min_lcm`, `min_k` is the factor corresponding to the smallest `lcm`.**
