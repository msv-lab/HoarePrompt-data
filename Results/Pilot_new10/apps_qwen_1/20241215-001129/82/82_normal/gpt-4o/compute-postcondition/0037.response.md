Postcondition: **`a` is updated to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is updated to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `diff` is positive and divisible by `k`, `k` is at least 1, `min_lcm` is the same, `min_k` is the same unless updated in the loop body, `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and either `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`)***
