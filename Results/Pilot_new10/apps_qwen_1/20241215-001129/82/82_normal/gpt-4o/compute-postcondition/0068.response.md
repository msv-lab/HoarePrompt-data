The code updates the value of `new_b` based on the formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Let's denote the current value of `b` as `b_current` and the current value of `candidate` as `candidate_current`. The updated value of `new_b` is calculated as follows:

1. Calculate `(b_current + candidate_current - 1) // candidate_current`.
2. Multiply the result by `candidate_current`.

Thus, the new value of `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\).

The other variables (`new_a`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `diff`, and `k`) remain in their original states.

Output State: **`new_a` is \(((a + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + c - 1) // c * c\); `new_b` is \((b + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated accordingly if `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but with a smaller `candidate` value than `min_k`, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, `k` is now `k + 1`, and `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer.**
