The code `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` calls a function `func_2` with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are defined as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. However, the function `func_2` and its implementation are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `current_lcm`. But we know that `new_a` and `new_b` retain their previously calculated values.

Output State: **`new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` is its original value, `candidate` is its original value, `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
