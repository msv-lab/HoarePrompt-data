The line of code `min_lcm = current_lcm` updates the value of `min_lcm` to be the same as the value of `current_lcm`. According to the precondition, `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and it is either less than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` with `candidate` being less than `min_k` if they are equal.

Since `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, the updated state is that `min_lcm` now holds the value of `current_lcm`. All other variables remain unchanged based on their preconditions.

Output State: **`a` is updated to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is updated to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `diff` is positive and divisible by `k`, `k` is at least 1, `min_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is the same unless updated in the loop body, `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and either `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`); `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`.**
