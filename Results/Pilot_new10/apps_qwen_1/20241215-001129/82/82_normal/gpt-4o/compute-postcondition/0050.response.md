The code snippet updates the value of `new_b` to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\). This operation does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, or `new_a`. The value of `new_a` remains unchanged, and `current_lcm` also remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `diff` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `min_lcm` remains the same, `min_k` remains the same, `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `new_b` is updated to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), and `current_lcm` remains the same.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `diff` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `min_lcm` remains the same, `min_k` remains the same, `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `new_b` is updated to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), and `current_lcm` remains the same.**
