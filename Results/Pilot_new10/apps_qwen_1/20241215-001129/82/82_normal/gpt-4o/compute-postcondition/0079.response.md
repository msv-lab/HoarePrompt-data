Postcondition: ***`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is the value of `current_lcm` and `min_k` is `candidate`. `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, `k` is `k + 2`, and `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer.***
