The code updates the value of `min_lcm` to be equal to `current_lcm`. Since `current_lcm` is either less than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` with `candidate` being less than `min_k`, this condition ensures that `min_lcm` is updated to the current value of `current_lcm`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` is its original value, `candidate` is its original value, `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is its original value**
