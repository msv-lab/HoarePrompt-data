The code initializes the variable `min_lcm` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `diff`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `min_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\); `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\); `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`; `min_lcm` is infinity (`float('inf')`).**
