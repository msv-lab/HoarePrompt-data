The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. This means that `min_lcm` now holds the value of `current_lcm`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `diff` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` remains the same, `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `new_b` is updated to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), and `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
