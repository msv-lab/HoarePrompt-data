Postcondition: ***`a` remains the same; `b` remains the same; `diff` remains the same; `k` remains the same; `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`); `min_k` is updated to `candidate` under the same condition; `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`***
