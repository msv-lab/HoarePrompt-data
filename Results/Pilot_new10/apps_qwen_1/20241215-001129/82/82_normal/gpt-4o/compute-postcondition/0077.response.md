The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. This means `min_lcm` now holds the same value as `current_lcm`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is now `current_lcm`, `min_k` remains unchanged, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, `k` is now `k + 2`, and `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer.**
