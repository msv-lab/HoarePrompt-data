Postcondition: ***`new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `a` is its original value; `candidate` is the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`; `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.***
