The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). The function has two cases: 
- Case_1: The program returns 0.
- Case_2: The program returns `min_k`, which is the value found to minimize the LCM.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and return either 0 or the value that minimizes the LCM of `a` and `b`.
