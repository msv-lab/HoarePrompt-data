Postcondition: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and must be a perfect square, `min_lcm` is infinity (`float('inf')`), `min_k` is `0`, `k` is `1`, and `diff` is divisible by `k`.**
