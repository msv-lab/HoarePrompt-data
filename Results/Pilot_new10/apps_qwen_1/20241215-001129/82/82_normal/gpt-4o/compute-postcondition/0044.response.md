`current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. Based on the initial state, `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated as follows:

- `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)

The function `func_2` is applied to these new values, and the result is assigned to `current_lcm`. Since the function `func_2` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact value of `current_lcm`. However, we know that `new_a` and `new_b` are adjusted versions of `a` and `b` respectively, ensuring they are multiples of `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` remains the same; `b` remains the same; `diff` remains the same; `k` remains the same; `min_lcm` remains the same; `min_k` remains the same; `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
