Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are updated to \((a + k - 1) // k * k\) and \((b + k - 1) // k * k\) respectively, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 1`, `k` is the last value it was updated to plus 1, `min_lcm` is the minimum value of `current_lcm` found during the loop executions, `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` value when `min_lcm` is updated, and `diff // (k - 1)` remains a positive integer. If `diff % k == 0`, then `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` when the loop finishes, where `new_a` is \(((a + final_k - 1) // final_k * final_k)\) and `new_b` is \((b + final_k - 1) // final_k * final_k)\), and `final_k` is the last value of `k` when the loop exits.**
