The code updates `current_lcm` to the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. Since `new_a` and `new_b` are defined as \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\) and the function `func_2` is applied to these values, the value of `current_lcm` changes to the result of this function call. However, the initial values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the updated `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `diff` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `min_lcm` remains the same, `min_k` remains the same, `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `new_b` is updated to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), and `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
