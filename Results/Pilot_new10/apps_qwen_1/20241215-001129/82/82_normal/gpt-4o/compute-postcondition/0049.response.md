Output State: **`a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `diff` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `min_lcm` remains the same, `min_k` remains the same, `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\) where `candidate` is the other candidate (either \(k\) or \(diff // k\)), `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
