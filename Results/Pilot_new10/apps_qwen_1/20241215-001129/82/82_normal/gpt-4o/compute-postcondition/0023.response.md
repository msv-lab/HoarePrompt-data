Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
  - `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\);
  - `a` is its original value;
  - `candidate` is the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`;
  - `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\);
  - `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- **Conditions for Updating `min_lcm` and `min_k`:**
  - If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`.
  - Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.

### For Loop:
```python
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable:**
   - The loop variable is `candidate`, which iterates over the values `[k, diff // k]`.

2. **Determine the Current `candidate`:**
   - If we are at the end of the previous iteration, it means the current `candidate` was either `k` or `diff // k`.

3. **Check the Next `candidate`:**
   - If the current `candidate` is `k`, the next `candidate` will be `diff // k`.
   - If the current `candidate` is `diff // k`, the next `candidate` will be `k`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to update the states based on the next value of `candidate`.
   - Since the loop has just finished with one of the values (either `k` or `diff // k`), the next iteration will use the other value.

5. **Update the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `new_a` and `new_b` will be recalculated using the next `candidate`.
   - `current_lcm` will be the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` using the next `candidate`.
   - Depending on the comparison with `min_lcm` and `min_k`, the values of `min_lcm` and `min_k` may or may not be updated.

### Conclusion:

- If the current `candidate` was `k`, the next `candidate` will be `diff // k`.
- If the current `candidate` was `diff // k`, the next `candidate` will be `k`.

Given this, we can state the following:

- `new_a` and `new_b` will be recalculated using the next `candidate`.
- `current_lcm` will be the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` using the next `candidate`.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` will either remain unchanged or be updated based on the comparison.

### Final Answer:

State: **`new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `a` is its original value; `candidate` is the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`; `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate` otherwise `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.**

The specific states to adjust for the next iteration would be:
- `candidate` will be the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]` (i.e., if the current `candidate` was `k`, the next `candidate` will be `diff // k`, and vice versa).

Thus, the states can be summarized as:
- **State: `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `a` is its original value; `candidate` is the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`; `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate` otherwise `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.**
