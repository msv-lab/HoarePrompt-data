Precondition: **a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\), and gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b.** 

**Note:** The function `func_1` is not provided, but based on the context, it likely computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. The function `func_2` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` using the formula \( \text{lcm}(x, y) = \frac{|x \cdot y|}{\text{gcd}(x, y)} \). However, since we are dealing with non-negative integers \(a+k\) and \(b+k\), the absolute value is unnecessary and the formula simplifies to \( \text{lcm}(a+k, b+k) = \frac{(a+k) \cdot (b+k)}{\text{gcd}(a+k, b+k)} \).
