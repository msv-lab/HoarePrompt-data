According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will continue as long as `b` is non-zero (i.e., `b` is not equal to 0). At the end of the last iteration, `b` has the value `a % b`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `b` is non-zero. Given that `b` is set to `a % b`, the only way `b` can be zero is if `a` is exactly divisible by `b`. Therefore, to ensure that `b` is non-zero, we need to adjust the initial values of `a` and `b` such that `a % b` is not zero.

Given the current state where `a` is `b` and `b` is `a % b`, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero. This means `a % b` must not be zero.

State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is `a % b`, and `b` must be non-zero**
