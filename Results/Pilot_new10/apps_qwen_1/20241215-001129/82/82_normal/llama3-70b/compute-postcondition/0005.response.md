The initial state is given as `a` is `b`, `b` is `a % b`, and `b` must be non-zero. The code snippet updates the values of `a` and `b` such that `a` becomes `b` and `b` becomes `a % b`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is `b`
- `b` is `a % b`

Let's denote the initial value of `b` as `k`. So initially:
- `a = k`
- `b = k % k`

Since `k % k` is always 0 for any non-zero `k`, the condition that `b` must be non-zero implies that `k` cannot be zero. However, for the sake of clarity in calculation, let's proceed with the understanding that `k` is a non-zero integer.

The code snippet:
```python
a, b = b, a % b
```
updates the values of `a` and `b` as follows:
- `a` now becomes the original value of `b`, which is `k`.
- `b` now becomes `a % b`, which is `k % k` and since `k` is non-zero, this is equivalent to `k % k = 0`.

So, after the code executes:
- `a` is now `k` (the original value of `b`)
- `b` is `0` (since `k % k` is 0)

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is 0**
