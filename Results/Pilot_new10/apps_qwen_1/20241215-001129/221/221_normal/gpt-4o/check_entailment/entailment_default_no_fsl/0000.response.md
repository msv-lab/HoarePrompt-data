Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided function `func` does not correctly solve the problem described. The function modifies `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations with `x`, but it does not account for the sum constraint (`a + b = s`). The function also does not return the number of solutions, which is required by the problem statement.

To illustrate, consider the following cases:

1. **Case 1: Input (9, 5)**
   - Expected Output: 4
   - Actual Output: The function does not return anything, so the output is undefined.
   
2. **Case 2: Input (3, 3)**
   - Expected Output: 2
   - Actual Output: The function does not return anything, so the output is undefined.

3. **Case 3: Input (5, 2)**
   - Expected Output: 0
   - Actual Output: The function does not return anything, so the output is undefined.

The function does not provide the number of solutions for the given constraints, and it does not return any value, which is required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
