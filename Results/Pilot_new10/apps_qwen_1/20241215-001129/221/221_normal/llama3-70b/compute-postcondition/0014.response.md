Postcondition: **`s` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\) and `s` is greater than 1, `x` is equal to its original value, `count` is 3, `a` is `s`, `b` is 0.** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and there is no change in the variables when the condition `a ^ b == x` is not met, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition if the condition is not satisfied. Given that the if part sets `count` to 3 if the condition is met, and there is no change in the variables in the else part (if it existed), the final state of the program matches the if part's postcondition.
