Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\) and `s` is greater than 1, `x` is equal to its original value, `count` is 2, `a` is `s - 1`, `b` is 1, if `a ^ b == x`. If the condition `a ^ b == x` is false, the values of `count`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.***
