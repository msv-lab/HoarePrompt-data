`s` and `x` are assigned the values from the input, which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The exact values of `s` and `x` depend on the input, but they are guaranteed to be non-negative integers within the specified ranges.

Output State: **`s` and `x` are non-negative integers such that 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^12 and 0 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^12, and their specific values are determined by the input.**
