You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    print(count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `s` is odd and `x` is non-zero. In such cases, there are no valid pairs `(a, b)` because the sum of two positive integers `a` and `b` would always result in an even number if they are both positive, and their XOR would also depend on their parity in a way that cannot satisfy the given conditions when `s` is odd and `x` is non-zero.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 2
```
There are no valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy both `a + b = 5` and `a ^ b = 2`. However, the program will incorrectly output `0`, which is not the correct answer. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and x are non-negative integers such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12.
def func():
    s, x = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\) and `s` is greater than 1, `x` is equal to its original value, `count` is the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a` is in the range `[1, s-1]`, `b = s - a`, and `a ^ b == x`, `a` and `b` are values from the last valid pair that satisfies `a ^ b == x` (or their original values if no such pair exists), and `b` is `s - a`.
    print(count)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
