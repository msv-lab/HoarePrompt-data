Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob based on the given rules. The program uses a while loop to triple Limak's weight and double Bob's weight each year until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The loop increments the `years` counter each time the weights are updated. The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) and works correctly for all examples provided in the problem description.
