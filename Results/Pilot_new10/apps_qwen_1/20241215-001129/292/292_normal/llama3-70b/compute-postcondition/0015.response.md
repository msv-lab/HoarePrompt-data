The code `print(years)` simply prints the value of the variable `years`. This does not change the value of `years`, nor does it affect the values of `a` or `b`. The only information printed is the value of `years`, which is the number of iterations the loop executed.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact number of iterations, we can denote the number of iterations as `years`. The output of the print statement will be this value.

Output State: **`a` is 3 raised to the power of `years`, `b` is 2 raised to the power of `years` multiplied by the original value of `b` (which is between 1 and 5), and the value of `years` is printed.**
