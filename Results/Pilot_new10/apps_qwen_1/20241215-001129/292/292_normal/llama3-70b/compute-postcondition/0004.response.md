The code `b *= 2` doubles the value of `b`. Initially, `b` is an integer entered by the user, and it satisfies the condition `1 <= a <= b <= 10`. Since `a` is 3 times its original value and its original value was between 1 and 10, the current value of `a` is between 3 and 30. However, because `a` cannot exceed 10, the only possible value for `a` is between 3 and 10.

After executing `b *= 2`, the value of `b` is doubled. Therefore, the new value of `b` will be in the range `2 <= b <= 20`, but it still needs to satisfy the condition `1 <= a <= b <= 10`. This means that the maximum value `b` can take is 10. Hence, the value of `b` will be `2 * b_original`, where `b_original` is the original value entered by the user, and this value must be less than or equal to 5 (since `b_original` itself must be less than or equal to 10/2 = 5).

The value of `years` remains unchanged and is still 0. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is 3, `b` is 2 * `b_original` (with `b_original` being an integer between 1 and 5), `years` is 0**
