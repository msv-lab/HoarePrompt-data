The function func does not accept any parameters as per the annotated code. Instead, it takes two integers `a` and `b` as inputs from the user, where `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\). The function then enters a loop where `a` is multiplied by 3, `b` is multiplied by 2, and the `years` counter is incremented until `a` becomes greater than `b`. After the loop ends, the function prints the value of `years`.

The functionality of the function is to:
**Take two positive integers `a` and `b` as input, where \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\), and determine the number of years required for `a` to become greater than `b` through repeated multiplication by 3 and 2, respectively.**
