Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. This adheres to the problem description, which states that the input will contain two integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\).

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The program initializes `years` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `a` is tripled (`a *= 3`).
     - `b` is doubled (`b *= 2`).
     - The number of years is incremented by 1 (`years += 1`).
   - The loop ensures that Limak's weight is continuously tripled and Bob's weight is continuously doubled until `a` becomes strictly greater than `b`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the value of `years`, which represents the number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.

4. **Correct Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when `a` becomes strictly greater than `b`. At this point, Limak's weight is indeed greater than Bob's weight, which is the desired condition.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required logic for all valid inputs within the specified range (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10). Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
