Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `a` and `b` as inputs from the user, where \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\).
2. **Weight Calculation**: The program simulates the growth of Limak’s and Bob’s weights over the years. Limak's weight is tripled each year, while Bob's weight is doubled each year.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until Limak’s weight (`a`) becomes strictly greater than Bob’s weight (`b`).
4. **Output**: Once the condition is met, the program prints the number of years it took for Limak to become larger than Bob.

The program follows the exact logic specified in the problem description, ensuring that it works correctly for all valid inputs within the given constraints (i.e., \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\)). Therefore, the program is correct.
