Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, where `a` is Limak's initial weight and `b` is Bob's initial weight. The code then enters a loop where Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled each year, and the number of years is incremented until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The loop terminates when `a > b`, and the number of years is printed. Given the constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\), the code will always find a solution within a reasonable number of iterations, ensuring that the program works correctly for every potential case.
