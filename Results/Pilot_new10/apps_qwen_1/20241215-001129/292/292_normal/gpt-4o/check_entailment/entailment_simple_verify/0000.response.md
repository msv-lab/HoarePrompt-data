Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of years required for Limak's weight to become strictly greater than Bob's weight. The annotations show that after each iteration of the loop, Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled, and the number of years is incremented accordingly. The loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
