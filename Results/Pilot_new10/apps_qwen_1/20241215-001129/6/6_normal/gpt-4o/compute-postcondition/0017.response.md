The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints given, the function seems to implicitly work with variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` which are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n. 

Given the nature of the constraints and the absence of parameters in the function definition, the function might be designed to be called with these variables externally and then process them internally. 

The output cases provided suggest that the function returns different values based on certain conditions involving these implicit variables.

Functionality: **The function accepts implicitly `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` as integers with specific constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) and returns values based on these variables.**
