The code assigns the value of `abs(pos - r)` to `move_to_r`. The value of `pos`, `r`, and the other variables remain unchanged. The `move_to_r` variable is now set to the absolute difference between `pos` and `r`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, `r != n`; `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`, `move_to_l` is the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`**
