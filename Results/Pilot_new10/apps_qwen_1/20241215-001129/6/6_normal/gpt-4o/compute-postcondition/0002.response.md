The code `print(0)` prints the value `0` to the console. This does not change the values of the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. The only change is that the console output will show `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n`, the console shows `0`**
