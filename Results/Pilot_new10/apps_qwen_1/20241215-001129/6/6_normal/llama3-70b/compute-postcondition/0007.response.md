Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`. If `pos` is greater than `r`, `ans` is `pos - r`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `l - pos` if `pos` is less than `l`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.***
