`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`. Since the input is split into integers, each variable will take the corresponding integer value from the input. The previous values of these variables are no longer relevant, but the constraints remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `r`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`**
