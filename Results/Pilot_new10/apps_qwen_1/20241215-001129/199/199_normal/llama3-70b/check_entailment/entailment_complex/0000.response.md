Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets all the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the input, ensuring that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9`.
   
2. **Function Logic:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` initializes a variable `ways` to count the number of valid ways to split the stick.
   - It uses two nested loops to iterate over possible values of `a` and `b`:
     - `a` ranges from `1` to `n // 2` to ensure that `a` is less than or equal to half of `n`.
     - `b` ranges from `a` to `(n - a) // 2` to ensure that `b` is also less than or equal to half of `n - a` and that `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the four parts can form a rectangle (since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, `a` and `b` must appear twice in the four parts).
   - The condition `a != b` ensures that a square cannot be formed (since a square requires all sides to be equal).

3. **Output:**
   - The function returns the total number of valid ways, which matches the problem requirement.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that a rectangle can be formed but not a square. Therefore, the program is correct.
