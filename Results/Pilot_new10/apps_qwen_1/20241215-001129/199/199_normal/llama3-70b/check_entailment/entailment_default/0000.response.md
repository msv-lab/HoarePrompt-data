Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to consider all valid ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the two pairs of sides of the rectangle are equal, which means it only checks for cases where the rectangle is actually a square. To ensure the formation of a rectangle but not a square, we need to check that the pairs of sides are different.

For example, consider the input `n = 10`. The correct ways to split the stick would be `{1, 1, 4, 4}`, `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, and `{2, 2, 3, 3}`. However, the provided code will miss `{1, 1, 4, 4}` because `a` and `b` cannot both be 1 and 4 simultaneously under the current logic. Similarly, it will miss `{2, 2, 3, 3}` because it requires `a` and `b` to be different.

To fix this, we need to adjust the logic to allow for different values of `a` and `b` that still satisfy the conditions for forming a rectangle but not a square.
