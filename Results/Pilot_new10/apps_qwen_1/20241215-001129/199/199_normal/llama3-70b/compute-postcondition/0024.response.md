Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `b` is the last value such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\), and `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions within the loop.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over values of `b` starting from `a` up to \(\frac{(n - a)}{2} + 1\).
- For each `b` within this range, the loop checks if \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\).
- If the condition is satisfied, `ways` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes all its iterations, `ways` will hold the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions.
- The value of `a` remains constant at \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\) throughout the loop because it is initialized outside the loop and does not change within it.
- The final value of `b` will be the last valid value that satisfies the condition \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) within the loop. If no such `b` exists, `ways` will remain 0.
