Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `b` is \(b_{\text{prev}} + 1\), the loop continues as long as \( b < (n - a) // 2 + 1 \). If `a` is not equal to `b` and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\), `ways` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.***
