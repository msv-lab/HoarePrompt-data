`ways` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ways` is 1, so after executing `ways += 1`, the new value of `ways` is 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `b` is `b + 1`, and `ways` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `b` is `b + 1`, and `ways` is 2**
