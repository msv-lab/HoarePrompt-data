Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\).
   - `b` is the last value such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) plus 1 (if any).
   - `ways` is incremented by 1 if the condition `a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` is true; otherwise, `ways` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `b` starting from `a` up to \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).

4. **Determining the Next Value of `b`:**
   - The loop will execute until it finds the next value of `b` such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\).
   - After finding such a value, `b` will be set to this value plus 1 (if any).

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `b` will be set to the next value such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) plus 1 (if any).
   - `ways` remains unchanged unless the condition `a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` is met, but we don't know if this condition was met yet.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3 (unchanged).
- `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\) (unchanged).
- `b` is the next value such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) plus 1 (if any).
- `ways` remains unchanged unless the condition was met in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\), `b` is the next value such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) plus 1 (if any), and `ways` remains unchanged.**
