The code snippet provided is:
```python
ways += 1
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Identify the Impact**: The variable `ways` is incremented by 1.
2. **Check Previous Values**: From the initial states, we know:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `ways` is 1.
   - `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.
   - `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - Twice the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n` (i.e., `2 * (a + b) == n`).

3. **Calculate the New Value**: Since `ways` is incremented by 1, the new value of `ways` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

4. **Update the Variables**: All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `ways` is now 2.
- `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- Twice the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n` (i.e., `2 * (a + b) == n`).

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is 2, `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `a` is not equal to `b`, and twice the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`.**
