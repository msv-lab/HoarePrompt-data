The code snippet `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) are not directly affected by this line of code. The loop condition remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3,
- `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\),
- `b` is \(b_{\text{prev}} + 1\),
- the loop continues as long as \( b < (n - a) // 2 + 1 \),

After executing the code snippet, the value of `ways` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `ways` depends on the number of iterations before this line was executed. However, since the exact number of iterations is not specified, we can only say that `ways` is now one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `b` is \(b_{\text{prev}} + 1\), the loop continues as long as \( b < (n - a) // 2 + 1 \), `ways` is incremented by 1**
