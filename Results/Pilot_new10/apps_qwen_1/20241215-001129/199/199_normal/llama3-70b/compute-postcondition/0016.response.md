The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. Since `ways` was not initialized in the initial state, it is assumed to be 0 before this operation. After executing the code, `ways` is now 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \), `b` is a value such that \( a \neq b \) and \( 2 * (a + b) = n \); `ways` is 1**
