Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code still does not fully cover all valid cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not correctly identify all pairs `(a, b)` such that the four resulting parts can form a rectangle but not a square. For instance, the program currently does not consider pairs like `{2, 3, 6, 9}` or `{1, 3, 7, 9}` which are valid according to the problem description. Additionally, the condition `a != rem // 2` might not be sufficient to ensure all valid non-square configurations. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the need for a more comprehensive approach.
