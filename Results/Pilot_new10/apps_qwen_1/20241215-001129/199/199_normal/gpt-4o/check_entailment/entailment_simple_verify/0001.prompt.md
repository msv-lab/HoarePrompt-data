You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the remaining length after the first two cuts cannot be divided into two unequal parts. For example, consider the input `20`. According to the problem description, there are four valid ways to cut the stick:

1. `{1, 1, 9, 9}`
2. `{2, 2, 8, 8}`
3. `{3, 3, 7, 7}`
4. `{4, 4, 6, 6}`

However, the program only checks if `rem` (the remaining length after the first two cuts) is greater than 0 and if it is even, without ensuring that `rem` can be split into two unequal parts. This results in missing some valid cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the remaining length can be split into two equal parts, which violates the condition of not being able to form a square.

For instance, in the case of `20`, the program would miss the valid way `{5, 5, 5, 5}` because it does not check if the remaining length can be split into two equal parts while still forming a rectangle.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 6) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, and n is greater than or equal to 6
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n//4\) and \(n - 2(a + b)\) is positive and even, and \(a \neq (n - 2(a + b)) // 2\), `b` is undefined, `rem` is undefined, and `a` is undefined.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the number of valid pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n//4, n - 2(a + b) is positive and even, and a ≠ (n - 2(a + b)) // 2


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
