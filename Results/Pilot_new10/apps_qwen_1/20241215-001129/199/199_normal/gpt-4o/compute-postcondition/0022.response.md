Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9 \) and \( n \geq 6 \); `count` is either 2 or 3; `b = n // 4 + 2`; `rem = -8`; `a = n // 4 + 2`. If `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, then `count` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, no change in the value of `count` since there is no else part specified.***
