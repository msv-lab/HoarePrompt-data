According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n // 4 + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\).
- `count` is 1.
- `b` is undefined.
- `rem` is undefined.
- The remainder of some operation is greater than 0 and even.
- The condition `a != rem // 2` holds true.

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `a` must satisfy the condition \(1 \leq a < n // 4 + 1\). Since `a` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `a` must be equal to the current value of `n // 4`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be incremented by 1, making it equal to `n // 4 + 1`. This means the new value of `a` will be `n // 4 + 1`.

The other variables (`count`, `b`, `rem`) remain unchanged since the problem statement does not specify any modifications to these variables within the loop body, and they are not affected by the loop's continuation.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is 1, `b` is undefined, `rem` is undefined, and `a` is \(n // 4 + 1\)**
