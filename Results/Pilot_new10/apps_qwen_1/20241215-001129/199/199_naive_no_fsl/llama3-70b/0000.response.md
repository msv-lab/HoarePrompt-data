Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total length `n` cannot be divided into four positive integer parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square. Specifically, the current implementation does not check if the remaining length after choosing `a` and `b` can form a valid rectangle with different side lengths.

For example, consider the input `20`. The program should output `4` because there are four valid ways to cut the stick into four parts to form a rectangle but not a square: `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`. However, the program fails to account for the possibility of forming a rectangle with different side lengths and outputs `0` instead.

The issue lies in the condition `if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n`. This condition only checks if `a` and `b` are different and if the sum of the two pairs equals `n`, which does not guarantee that the remaining lengths can form a rectangle with different side lengths.
