Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the stick length `n` is odd. When `n` is odd, it's impossible to form a rectangle with four parts of different lengths because the sum of two pairs of unequal parts would not equal half of `n`. However, the current implementation does not check if `n` is odd before attempting to find valid partitions.

For example, consider the input `n = 5`. The program will still attempt to find valid partitions, but since `n` is odd, no valid partition exists, and the program will incorrectly count this as a valid way to split the stick.
