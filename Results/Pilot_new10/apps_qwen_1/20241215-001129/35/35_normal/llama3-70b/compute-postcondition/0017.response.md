The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the given function definition. However, based on the constraints provided, the function likely relies on external variables or arguments that are not shown in the function signature but are implied to be in scope.

Given the constraints:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\) and \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\).

The output of the function depends on the relationship between these variables, but the function itself does not explicitly take these as parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to use the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` (which are not passed as parameters but are assumed to be in scope) and return a value based on their relationships. The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function uses variables `n`, `a`, and `b` (not passed as parameters) and returns a value based on their relationships.**
