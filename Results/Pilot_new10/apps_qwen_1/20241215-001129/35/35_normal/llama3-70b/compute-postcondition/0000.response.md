The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The initial conditions are that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`. After executing this line of code, the values of `a` and `b` remain the same, but `n` is updated to the new value entered by the user.

Since the exact values entered by the user are not specified, we can only say that `n`, `a`, and `b` now hold the values of the integers entered by the user, which satisfy the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b` with `n`, `a`, and `b` being the values entered by the user.**
