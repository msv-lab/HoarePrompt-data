Let's break down the given conditions and the `while True` loop:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `x` is the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and `a + b` inclusive.
   - `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `b` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.

2. **`while True` Loop:**
   - The loop runs indefinitely as long as it is not explicitly broken out of.

Given that the loop is `while True`, the loop will always execute at least once without any additional conditions. Therefore, no adjustments are needed in the states for the loop to execute at least one time.

**State:**
State: **`x` is the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b`; `n` is an integer between 2 and `a + b` inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.**
