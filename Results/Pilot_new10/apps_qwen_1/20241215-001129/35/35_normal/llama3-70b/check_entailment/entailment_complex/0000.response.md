Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `x`:**
   - The variable `x` is initialized as `min(n, a, b)`. However, this initialization is not correct because it does not consider the requirement that each plate should contain at least one piece of cake from one of the cakes. Instead, it should start from 1 and incrementally check if the distribution is valid.

2. **Loop Logic Issue:**
   - The loop logic does not correctly ensure that the minimum number of pieces on any plate is maximized. The condition `a - x + (b - x) >= x` is not sufficient to guarantee that each plate has at least `x` pieces of cake. Additionally, the decrement of `x` inside the loop might not find the correct value of `x`.

3. **Incorrect Termination Condition:**
   - The loop breaks when `a - x + (b - x) >= x`, but this does not necessarily mean that the minimum number of pieces on any plate is maximized. The loop should continue until it finds the highest possible `x` that satisfies the conditions.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Start with `x = 1` and incrementally check if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate has at least `x` pieces.
2. Use a binary search approach to find the maximum `x` efficiently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    
    def is_valid(x):
        return (a // x) + (b // x) >= n
    
    left, right = 1, min(a, b)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2
        if is_valid(mid):
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            
    print(left)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Binary Search:** We use binary search to find the maximum `x` such that each plate has at least `x` pieces.
- **is_valid Function:** This function checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate has at least `x` pieces.
- **Initial Conditions:** `left` starts at 1 and `right` starts at the minimum of `a` and `b`.
- **Binary Search Loop:** We adjust `left` and `right` until they converge to the maximum possible `x`.

This approach ensures that the program meets the problem description accurately.
