You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using binary search to find the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate will contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake. However, there is a logical error in the `can_distribute` function.

The `can_distribute` function checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least `x` pieces of cake. The current implementation of `can_distribute` uses integer division `//`, which can lead to incorrect results when `a` or `b` is not perfectly divisible by `x`.

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 4
a = 3
b = 3
```
- If \( x = 1 \), we can distribute the cakes as follows:
  - Plate 1: 1 piece from the first cake and 1 piece from the second cake.
  - Plate 2: 1 piece from the first cake and 1 piece from the second cake.
  - Plate 3: 1 piece from the first cake.
  - Plate 4: 1 piece from the second cake.

This distribution satisfies all conditions, but the current `can_distribute` function would incorrectly return `False` because:
- \( 3 // 1 + 3 // 1 = 3 + 3 = 6 \)
- Since \( 6 \geq 4 \), it returns `True` initially, but the logic fails to correctly handle the distribution of the last piece.

A correct implementation of `can_distribute` should ensure that the sum of the ceiling values of the divisions is checked, ensuring that each plate gets at least \( x \) pieces of cake.

Here is a corrected version of the `can_distribute` function:
```python
import math

def can_distribute(x):
    return math.ceil(a / x) + math.ceil(b / x) >= n
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\); `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 100\); `low` is the smallest integer such that \(\text{can\_distribute(low)}\) is `True`, and `high` is the largest integer such that \(\text{can\_distribute(high)}\) is `False`; `mid` is \((\text{low} + \text{high}) // 2\).
    return low - 1
    #The program returns low - 1, where low is the smallest integer such that can_distribute(low) is True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and n is a positive integer representing the number of plates such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #`a // x + b // x` is compared to `n`, and the program returns `True` if the sum is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `False`


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
