Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\); `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 100\); `low` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1\) if `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`; otherwise, `low` is \(1\) and `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\).***
