The code updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. Given the initial state, let's determine the new values:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\).
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 100\).
- `low` is 1.
- `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\).
- `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\).

The new value of `high` will be equal to `mid`, which is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\). 

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\).
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 100\).
- `low` is 1.
- `high` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\).
- `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\); `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 100\); `low` is 1; `high` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\); `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\)**
