The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. Based on the initial conditions, `mid` is calculated as `(\min(a, b) + 2) // 2`. Since the value of `mid` is known, `low` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \); \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq a \leq 100 \) and \( 1 \leq b \leq 100 \); \( low = (\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1 \) if `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`; otherwise, \( low = 1 \) and `mid = (\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 \); `high` is greater than `low`, and `mid = (low + high) // 2` and `low` is `mid + 1`.**
