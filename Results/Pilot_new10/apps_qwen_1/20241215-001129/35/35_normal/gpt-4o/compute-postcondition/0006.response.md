The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid`. From the initial state, we know that `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \)
- `a` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq a \leq 100 \)
- `b` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq b \leq 100 \)
- `low` is 1
- `high` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\)
- `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\)
- `can_distribute(mid)` returns False

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \); `a` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq a \leq 100 \); `b` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq b \leq 100 \); `low` is 1; `high` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\); `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\); `can_distribute(mid)` returns False**
