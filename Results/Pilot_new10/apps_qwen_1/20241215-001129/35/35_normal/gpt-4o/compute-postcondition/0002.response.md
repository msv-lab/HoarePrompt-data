The annotated code states that the function `can_distribute(x)` returns `True` if `a // x + b // x` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `False` otherwise. However, the actual code only contains a single return statement without any conditions checked before it. Given the annotations and the actual code, we need to ensure that the function works correctly under all conditions.

From the annotations and the actual code, the function `can_distribute(x)` takes a parameter `x` and checks if the integer division of `a` by `x` plus the integer division of `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. This means that the function determines whether the given number of pieces per plate (`x`) is sufficient to distribute both cakes among `n` plates.

Given the constraints that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, we can conclude that the function checks if distributing the pieces of the two cakes according to `x` is possible without violating the constraints.

Functionality: **The function `can_distribute(x)` accepts a parameter `x` and returns `True` if distributing `a` and `b` pieces of cake among `n` plates results in each plate having at least `x` pieces of cake. Otherwise, it returns `False`.**
