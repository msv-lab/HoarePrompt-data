Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a pair (a, b) is good. Specifically, the conditions `func_1(a, b) == x` and `func_2(a, b) == y` are used to check if the GCD and LCM conditions are met, but these functions are not actually calculating the GCD and LCM as required.

The function `func_1` calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, which is correct. However, the function `func_2` calculates the LCM incorrectly. It uses the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // GCD(a, b)`, but this formula assumes that `a` and `b` are coprime, which is not always the case.

To correctly implement the solution, the program should calculate the GCD and LCM properly and check if they match the given values `x` and `y`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0

for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if gcd(a, b) == x and (a * b) // gcd(a, b) == y:
            count += 1

print(count)
```

This corrected version uses the built-in `gcd` function from the `math` module to ensure correct calculation of the GCD and LCM.
