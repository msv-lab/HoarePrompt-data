Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a pair (a, b) is good based on the given conditions. Specifically, the program checks if `func_1(a, b) == x` and `func_2(a, b) == y`, but this approach does not guarantee that both the GCD and LCM conditions are met simultaneously for all possible pairs. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for any pair (a, b), the following conditions hold:
1. `gcd(a, b) == x`
2. `lcm(a, b) == y`

The current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` is correct for computing GCD and LCM, but the nested loops do not guarantee that all valid pairs (a, b) are checked. For example, consider the input `l = 1`, `r = 2`, `x = 1`, `y = 2`. The expected output is 2, but the provided program will only check pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2), missing the pair (2, 1).

A more efficient approach would be to directly compute the number of valid pairs by leveraging the relationship between GCD and LCM, which is `a * b = gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b)`. This can help in identifying valid pairs more effectively without brute-forcing through all possible values within the range.
