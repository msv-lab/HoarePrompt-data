a and b are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\). The function `func_1` is used to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b, and it is assumed that within the main program, the values of a and b are set to x and y respectively, or some multiples thereof that satisfy the conditions for being a good pair.
