Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of good pairs \((a, b)\) such that \( \text{GCD}(a, b) = x \) and \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = y \). The issue lies in the nested loops where the code only checks pairs \((a, b)\) with \(a \leq b\). However, the problem description requires checking all pairs within the given range, including those where \(a > b\).

For example, consider the input:
```
1 2 1 2
```
The correct answer should be 2, as the pairs \((1, 2)\) and \((2, 1)\) are both valid. However, the current implementation only counts \((1, 2)\) once because it starts the inner loop from `a` to `r`.

To fix this, the inner loop should start from `l` to `r`, ensuring all possible pairs are checked. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)
```

With this correction, the code will correctly count all good pairs within the specified range.
