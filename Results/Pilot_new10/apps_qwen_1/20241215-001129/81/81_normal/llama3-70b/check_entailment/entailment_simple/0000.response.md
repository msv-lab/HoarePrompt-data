Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to count the number of pairs of integers (a, b) such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is x and the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b is y, with the constraints \(l \leq a, b \leq r\).

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program uses nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs (a, b) within the given range [l, r].
   - For each pair, it checks whether the GCD of a and b is equal to x using `func_1(a, b)`.
   - It then checks whether the LCM of a and b is equal to y using `func_2(a, b)`.
   - If both conditions are met, the count is incremented.

3. **Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` correctly computes the GCD of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2(a, b)` correctly computes the LCM of a and b using the relationship between GCD and LCM, i.e., \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).

4. **Constraints and Range**:
   - The program iterates over the specified range [l, r], ensuring that all pairs (a, b) within this range are checked.
   - It accounts for the fact that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a â‰  b.

5. **Correctness Across All Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when x and y have specific relationships (e.g., when x is 1, or when y is a multiple of x).
   - The program ensures that the GCD and LCM conditions are strictly adhered to, and only valid pairs are counted.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and satisfies all the constraints and conditions specified in the problem description, the program is correct. Therefore, the output is "True".
