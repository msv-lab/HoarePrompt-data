Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided annotated code confirms that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly calculate the LCM as required. While `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD, `func_2` incorrectly calculates the LCM by assuming that the product of `a` and `b` divided by their GCD will always give the correct LCM, which is not true. The corrected version provided in the explanation should be used instead, where the LCM is calculated correctly as `(a * b) // gcd(a, b)` using Python's built-in `gcd` function.
