You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a pair (a, b) is good. Specifically, the conditions `func_1(a, b) == x` and `func_2(a, b) == y` are used to check if the GCD and LCM conditions are met, but these functions are not actually calculating the GCD and LCM as required.

The function `func_1` calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, which is correct. However, the function `func_2` calculates the LCM incorrectly. It uses the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // GCD(a, b)`, but this formula assumes that `a` and `b` are coprime, which is not always the case.

To correctly implement the solution, the program should calculate the GCD and LCM properly and check if they match the given values `x` and `y`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0

for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if gcd(a, b) == x and (a * b) // gcd(a, b) == y:
            count += 1

print(count)
```

This corrected version uses the built-in `gcd` function from the `math` module to ensure correct calculation of the GCD and LCM.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\). The function `func_1` is used to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b, and it is assumed that within the main program, the values of a and b are set to x and y respectively, or some multiples thereof that satisfy the conditions for being a good pair.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \( \text{func\_1}(a, b) \) returns their greatest common divisor (GCD), and \( a \times b \) is divisible by their GCD.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #`a * b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
