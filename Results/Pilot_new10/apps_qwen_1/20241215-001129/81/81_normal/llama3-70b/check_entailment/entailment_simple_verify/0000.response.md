Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment was accurate because the program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a pair (a, b) is good. Although the `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD, the `func_2` function incorrectly calculates the LCM. The annotated version of the code confirms that `func_2` uses the formula `(a * b) // GCD(a, b)` to calculate the LCM, which is incorrect as it does not account for the actual LCM value when `a` and `b` are not coprime. The correct approach would be to directly calculate the LCM as `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`, ensuring the formula is applied correctly. The provided corrected version uses the built-in `gcd` function and ensures the correct calculation of the LCM. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being False is accurate.
