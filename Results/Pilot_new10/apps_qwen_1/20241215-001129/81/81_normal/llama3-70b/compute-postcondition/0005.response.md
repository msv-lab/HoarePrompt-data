The initial state is `a` is `a_initial % b_initial`, `b` is `a_initial`. The code `a, b = b, a % b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. According to the modulus operation, `a % b` will be `a_initial % b_initial % b`, which simplifies to `a_initial % b_initial` since `a` is already defined as `a_initial % b_initial`. 

Thus, `a` will take the value of `b`, which is `a_initial`, and `b` will take the value of `a % b`, which is `a_initial % b_initial`.

Output State: **`a` is `a_initial`, `b` is `a_initial % b_initial`**
