Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using `func_1(a, b)`, and returns the result of dividing their product by their GCD.**

This summary covers the following points:
- The function takes two positive integers `a` and `b`.
- It uses `func_1(a, b)` to find the GCD of `a` and `b`.
- It divides the product of `a` and `b` by their GCD and returns the result.

There are no apparent edge cases or missing logic in the provided code that would alter this summary.
