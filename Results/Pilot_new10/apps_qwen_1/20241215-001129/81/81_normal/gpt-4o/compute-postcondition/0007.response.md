`a` is assigned the value `i * x`. The value of `i` is such that `z % i == 0`, meaning `i` is a divisor of `z`. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains unknown. Therefore, the updated value of `a` is `i * x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`z` is at least 1, there exists an integer `i` such that `z % i == 0`; `a` is `i * x`**
