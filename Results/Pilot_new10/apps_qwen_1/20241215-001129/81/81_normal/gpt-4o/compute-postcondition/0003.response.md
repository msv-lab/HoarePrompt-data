The code `z = y // x` assigns the value of `y // x` to the variable `z`. Given the initial conditions that `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` will be the integer division of `y` by `x`. The other variables `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9, `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9 and y is divisible by x, `z` is the integer division of `y` by `x`.**
