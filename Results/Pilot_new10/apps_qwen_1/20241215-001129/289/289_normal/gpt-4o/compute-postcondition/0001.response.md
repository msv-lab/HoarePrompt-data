`max_games` is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`. The method `bit_length()` returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, the maximum number of bits required to represent `n` is 60 (as \(2^{60} > 10^{18}\)). Therefore, `n.bit_length()` will return a value between 1 and 60, and `max_games` will be that value minus 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive; `max_games` is `n.bit_length() - 1`**
