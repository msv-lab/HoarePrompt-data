The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the condition that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^18, representing the number of players participating in the tournament.

However, since no specific output conditions are provided other than the constraint on `n`, we can only describe what the parameter `n` represents without specifying the return value directly.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the condition that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^18, representing the number of players participating in the tournament.**
