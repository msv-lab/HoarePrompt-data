The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer before assigning it to the variable `n`. Since the input is expected to be within the range `2 <= n <= 10^18`, the variable `n` will hold the specific integer value provided as input. All other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive**
