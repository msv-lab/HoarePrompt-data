The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some internal logic since no parameters are specified. However, given the constraints, it implies that the function might be processing or calculating something related to the range 2 to \(10^{18}\).

Since no specific output cases are provided, we can only state that the function processes a positive integer within the specified range and returns a value.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on processing a positive integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\).**
