`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The value of `n` is now the integer input from the user, and the initial condition that `n` is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^{18}\) is maintained. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, and 2 <= n <= \(10^{18}\)**
