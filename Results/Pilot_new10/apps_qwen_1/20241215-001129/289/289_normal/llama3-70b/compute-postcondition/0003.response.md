Let's analyze the provided annotated code and the return postconditions step by step.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n.bit_length() - 1)
```

- **Input**: The function takes no parameters. Instead, it uses `input()` to read a positive integer `n` from the user.
- **Processing**: The function computes the bit length of `n` using `n.bit_length()`, which returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary.
- **Output**: The function prints `n.bit_length() - 1`.

### Return Postconditions:
- The function processes a positive integer `n` within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\).
- The function returns a value based on the bit length of the input integer minus one.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Edge Case 1**: The function assumes that the input is a valid positive integer. If an invalid input is provided (e.g., non-integer, negative number), the program would raise a `ValueError` and the function would terminate.
- **Edge Case 2**: The function does not handle non-positive integers (i.e., 0 or negative numbers). Providing such inputs would cause `int(input())` to fail or produce unexpected results.
- **Edge Case 3**: The function works correctly for large values of `n` up to \(10^{18}\), but for very large numbers, the computation might still work due to the properties of `bit_length()`.

### Summary:
The function reads a positive integer `n` from the user, calculates the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, and then subtracts one from this value before printing the result.

### Functionality:
**The function reads a positive integer `n` from the user, calculates the bit length of `n` minus one, and prints the result.**
