The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the value of `n` after the input operation will be the integer entered by the user within this range. The variable `n` will hold the new value, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) (after being updated by the input)**
