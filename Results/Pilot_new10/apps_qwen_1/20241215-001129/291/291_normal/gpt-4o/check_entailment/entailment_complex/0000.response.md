Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the minimum number of segments that Sofia needs to draw with a ruler to create \( n \) squares in the manner described. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes an integer input \( n \) and processes it within the specified range \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \).

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n)` aims to find the minimum number of segments needed to draw \( n \) squares. This is done by iterating over possible values of \( a \) from 1 to \( \text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1 \).

3. **Segment Calculation**: For each value of \( a \), the program calculates \( b = \frac{n + a - 1}{a} \). This formula is derived from the requirement that the total number of squares \( n \) can be expressed as a combination of rows and columns. The expression \( n + a - 1 \) ensures that the division results in an integer, and the floor division operator `//` is used to get the integer part.

4. **Minimum Segments Needed**: The segments needed for a given \( a \) and \( b \) are calculated as \( 2 \times (a + b) \). This accounts for the fact that each square requires 2 segments (one vertical and one horizontal), and the values of \( a \) and \( b \) represent the number of segments that need to be drawn initially with a ruler.

5. **Optimization**: The function updates `min_segments_needed` to keep track of the smallest number of segments required. By iterating over all possible values of \( a \), the function ensures that it finds the optimal solution.

6. **Output**: Finally, the function returns the minimum number of segments required, which is the result of the optimization process.

The program adheres to the problem description by:
- Considering all possible configurations of squares.
- Ensuring that the number of initial segments drawn with a ruler is minimized.
- Using the mathematical formulation correctly to calculate the segments needed.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem as described.
