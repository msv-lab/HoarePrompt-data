You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
    return min_segments_needed


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the number of segments drawn with a ruler. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the number of segments needed does not match the problem description.

To illustrate, let's consider the example where \( n = 4 \):

- According to the problem description, drawing 4 squares requires 4 segments to be drawn with a ruler initially, and the rest can be drawn using the initial ones as guides. Therefore, the correct output should be 4.

However, the program calculates the number of segments using the formula \( 2 \times (a + b) \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are determined from the equation \( n = ab \). For \( n = 4 \), the possible values for \( a \) and \( b \) are:

- \( a = 1, b = 4 \): \( 2 \times (1 + 4) = 10 \)
- \( a = 2, b = 2 \): \( 2 \times (2 + 2) = 8 \)
- \( a = 4, b = 1 \): \( 2 \times (4 + 1) = 10 \)

The program returns the minimum value among these, which is 8. However, this is incorrect according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input().strip())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    min_segments_needed = float('inf')
    for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop step-by-step.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis
    #
    #1. **Initialization**:
    #   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
    #   - `min_segments_needed` is initialized to infinity.
    #
    #2. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The loop iterates over `a` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
    #   - For each iteration, it calculates:
    #     - `b = (n + a - 1) // a`
    #     - `segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)`
    #   - It updates `min_segments_needed` to be the minimum of its current value and `segments_needed`.
    #
    #3. **Understanding the Loop**:
    #   - The goal is to find the minimum `segments_needed` which is defined as \(2 \times (a + b)\), where \(b\) is computed as \((n + a - 1) // a\).
    #   - The loop effectively tries different values of `a` to find the combination that minimizes `segments_needed`.
    #
    #### Iteration Observations
    #
    #- **First Iteration**:
    #  - `a = 1`
    #  - `b = (n + 1 - 1) // 1 = n`
    #  - `segments_needed = 2 * (1 + n) = 2 * (n + 1)`
    #  - `min_segments_needed` is updated to `2 * (n + 1)`.
    #
    #- **Second Iteration**:
    #  - `a = 2`
    #  - `b = (n + 2 - 1) // 2 = (n + 1) // 2`
    #  - `segments_needed = 2 * (2 + (n + 1) // 2)`
    #  - `min_segments_needed` is updated to the minimum of `2 * (n + 1)` and `2 * (2 + (n + 1) // 2)`.
    #
    #- **Third Iteration**:
    #  - `a = 3`
    #  - `b = (n + 3 - 1) // 3 = (n + 2) // 3`
    #  - `segments_needed = 2 * (3 + (n + 2) // 3)`
    #  - `min_segments_needed` is updated to the minimum of the previous value and `2 * (3 + (n + 2) // 3)`.
    #
    #### Final State After All Iterations
    #
    #- The loop will iterate until `a` reaches `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
    #- The variable `min_segments_needed` will be updated to the minimum value of `2 * (a + b)` for all valid `a`.
    #
    #Since the loop will try all possible values of `a` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, the final value of `min_segments_needed` will be the smallest value obtained from these calculations.
    #
    #### Output State
    #
    #After the loop has completed all its iterations, the values of the variables will be as follows:
    #
    #- `min_segments_needed` will be the minimum value of `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for all `a` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
    #- `a` and `b` will no longer be relevant since the loop has finished.
    #- `n` remains unchanged.
    #
    #Thus, the output state is:
    #
    #**Output State: `min_segments_needed` is the minimum value of \(2 \times (a + \frac{n + a - 1}{a})\) for all \(a\) from 1 to \(\text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).**
    return min_segments_needed
    #`min_segments_needed` is the minimum value of \(2 \times (a + \frac{n + a - 1}{a})\) for all \(a\) from 1 to \(\text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\), where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and returns the minimum value of \(2 \times (a + \frac{n + a - 1}{a})\) for all \(a\) from 1 to \(\text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\). The function iterates through all possible values of `a` within the specified range and calculates the corresponding `segments_needed` for each value of `a`, updating the `min_segments_needed` to the smallest value found.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
