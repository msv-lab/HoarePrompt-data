You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    min_segments_needed = float('inf')
    for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop step-by-step.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis
    #
    #1. **Initialization**:
    #   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
    #   - `min_segments_needed` is initialized to infinity.
    #
    #2. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The loop iterates over `a` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
    #   - For each iteration, it calculates:
    #     - `b = (n + a - 1) // a`
    #     - `segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)`
    #   - It updates `min_segments_needed` to be the minimum of its current value and `segments_needed`.
    #
    #3. **Understanding the Loop**:
    #   - The goal is to find the minimum `segments_needed` which is defined as \(2 \times (a + b)\), where \(b\) is computed as \((n + a - 1) // a\).
    #   - The loop effectively tries different values of `a` to find the combination that minimizes `segments_needed`.
    #
    #### Iteration Observations
    #
    #- **First Iteration**:
    #  - `a = 1`
    #  - `b = (n + 1 - 1) // 1 = n`
    #  - `segments_needed = 2 * (1 + n) = 2 * (n + 1)`
    #  - `min_segments_needed` is updated to `2 * (n + 1)`.
    #
    #- **Second Iteration**:
    #  - `a = 2`
    #  - `b = (n + 2 - 1) // 2 = (n + 1) // 2`
    #  - `segments_needed = 2 * (2 + (n + 1) // 2)`
    #  - `min_segments_needed` is updated to the minimum of `2 * (n + 1)` and `2 * (2 + (n + 1) // 2)`.
    #
    #- **Third Iteration**:
    #  - `a = 3`
    #  - `b = (n + 3 - 1) // 3 = (n + 2) // 3`
    #  - `segments_needed = 2 * (3 + (n + 2) // 3)`
    #  - `min_segments_needed` is updated to the minimum of the previous value and `2 * (3 + (n + 2) // 3)`.
    #
    #### Final State After All Iterations
    #
    #- The loop will iterate until `a` reaches `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
    #- The variable `min_segments_needed` will be updated to the minimum value of `2 * (a + b)` for all valid `a`.
    #
    #Since the loop will try all possible values of `a` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, the final value of `min_segments_needed` will be the smallest value obtained from these calculations.
    #
    #### Output State
    #
    #After the loop has completed all its iterations, the values of the variables will be as follows:
    #
    #- `min_segments_needed` will be the minimum value of `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for all `a` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
    #- `a` and `b` will no longer be relevant since the loop has finished.
    #- `n` remains unchanged.
    #
    #Thus, the output state is:
    #
    #**Output State: `min_segments_needed` is the minimum value of \(2 \times (a + \frac{n + a - 1}{a})\) for all \(a\) from 1 to \(\text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).**
    return min_segments_needed
    #`min_segments_needed` is the minimum value of \(2 \times (a + \frac{n + a - 1}{a})\) for all \(a\) from 1 to \(\text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\), where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and returns the minimum value of \(2 \times (a + \frac{n + a - 1}{a})\) for all \(a\) from 1 to \(\text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\). The function iterates through all possible values of `a` within the specified range and calculates the corresponding `segments_needed` for each value of `a`, updating the `min_segments_needed` to the smallest value found.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
