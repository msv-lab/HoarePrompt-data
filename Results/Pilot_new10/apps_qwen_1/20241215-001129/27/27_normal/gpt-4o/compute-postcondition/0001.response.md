The code reads three real numbers from input, splits them using `input().split()`, and converts each to a float before assigning them to `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the exact input values are not specified, the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` will hold the values entered by the user, but the initial conditions that they are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point and lie in the range 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive, remain valid.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, and they lie in the range 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive; these values are obtained from the input.**
