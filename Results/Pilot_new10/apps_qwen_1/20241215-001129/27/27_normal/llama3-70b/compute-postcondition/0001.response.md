`a1` is assigned the value of `x` raised to the power of (`y` raised to the power of `z`). Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively, `a1` becomes `a ** (b ** c)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c`, `a1` is `a ** (b ** c)`.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c`, `a1` is `a ** (b ** c)`**
