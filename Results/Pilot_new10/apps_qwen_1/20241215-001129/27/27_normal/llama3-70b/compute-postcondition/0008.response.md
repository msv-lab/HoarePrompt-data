The code `a8 = (y ** z) ** x` impacts the program by assigning the value of `(y ** z) ** x` to `a8`. Given the initial state where `x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, and `z` is `c`, we can substitute these values into the expression:

- `y` is `b`
- `z` is `c`
- `x` is `a`

So, `a8` is assigned the value of `(b ** c) ** a`.

The states of the other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `a4`, `a6`, and `a7`) are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c`, `a1` is `a`, `a2` is `a`, `a4` is `(a`, `a6` is `b`, `a7` is `(b`, `a8` is `(b ** c) ** a**.
