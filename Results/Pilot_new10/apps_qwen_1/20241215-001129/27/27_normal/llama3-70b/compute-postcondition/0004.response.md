`a4` is assigned the value of `(x ** z) ** y`. Given that `x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, and `z` is `c`, we can substitute these values into the expression. Therefore, `a4` becomes `(a ** c) ** b`.

The output state is: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c`, `a1` is `a`, `a2` is `a`, `a4` is `(a ** c) ** b**.
