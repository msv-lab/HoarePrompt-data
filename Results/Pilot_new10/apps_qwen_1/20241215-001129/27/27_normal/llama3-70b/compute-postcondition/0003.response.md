`a3` is assigned the value of `(x ** y) ** z`, which simplifies to `a ** (b ** c) ** z`. Given that `x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, and `z` is `c`, the value of `a3` becomes `a ** (b ** c) ** c`. The values of `a1`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c`, `a1` is `a`, `a2` is `a ** (c ** b)`, `a3` is `a ** (b ** c) ** c`**
