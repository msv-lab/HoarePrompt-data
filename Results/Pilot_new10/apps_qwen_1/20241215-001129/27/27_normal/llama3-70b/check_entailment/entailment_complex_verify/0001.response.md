Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates all twelve possible expressions, finds the maximum value among them, and prints the corresponding expression in the required format. The program handles the given examples correctly, and the annotations confirm that the program follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
