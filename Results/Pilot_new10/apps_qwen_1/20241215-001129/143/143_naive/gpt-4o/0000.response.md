Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to buy at least L liters of lemonade. The solution iterates over the possible bottle types in reverse order, updating the minimum cost needed to obtain a certain amount of lemonade. The program handles all potential cases by considering the cost of individual bottles and the cumulative cost of doubling the previous amount of lemonade. The logic ensures that the minimum cost is calculated for each possible amount of lemonade up to L liters, and the final result is accurate for all given inputs within the specified constraints.
