Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program seems to correctly implement a dynamic programming solution to minimize the cost of purchasing at least L liters of lemonade. The program iterates through each possible volume of lemonade that can be bought and updates the minimum cost required to reach each volume up to L. Given the constraints and examples, the logic appears sound:

1. It initializes a DP array `dp` with infinity for all values except `dp[0]`, which is set to 0.
2. It iterates over each possible volume of lemonade from 1 to L and updates the DP array based on the costs of different bottle types.
3. It ensures that it only considers volumes up to the current index `i` when updating the DP table.
4. Finally, it prints the minimum cost required to get at least L liters of lemonade, or -1 if it's not possible.

Since the program follows the dynamic programming approach correctly and handles the constraints and examples provided, it appears to be correct for every potential case within the given problem description.
