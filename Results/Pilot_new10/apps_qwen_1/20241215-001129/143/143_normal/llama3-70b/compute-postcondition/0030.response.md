`j` is updated to `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is initially `1`, the new value of `j` is `2 ** 1 - 1 = 1`. The value of `vol` remains unchanged because the expression `2 ** j - 1` does not affect `vol` directly, only `j`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `dp[i]`, `j_end`) remain in their initial or unchanged states.

Output State: **`i` is `L + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[j]` where `j` is `1`, `vol` is `1`, `j` is `1`**
