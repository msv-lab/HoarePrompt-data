Postcondition: ***`i` is `L + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[1]` if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`. Since there is no else part, the only case considered is when `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, in which case `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]` when `vol` is `1`.***
