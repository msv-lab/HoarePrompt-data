The code snippet sets `vol` to `2 ** j - 1`. However, there is no defined value or initial value for `j` in the given initial state. Since `j` is not defined, its value remains unknown, and therefore, the value of `vol` cannot be determined directly from the given information. The only variables that are affected by this line of code are `vol`, which is now set to `2 ** j - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `vol` is 2 ** j - 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
