`dp[0]` is assigned the value `0`. This means that the first element in the `dp` list, which was previously set to `float('inf')`, is now `0`. The values of `n`, `L`, `c`, and `costs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the first integer from input, `L` is assigned the second integer from input, `c` is a list of n integers, `costs` is a list of L integers assigned from the second input, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where the first element is `0` and all other elements are `float('inf')`**
