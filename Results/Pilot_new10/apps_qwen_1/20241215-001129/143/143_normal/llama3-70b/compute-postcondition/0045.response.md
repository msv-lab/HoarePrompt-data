The code `vol = 2 ** j - 1` updates the value of `vol`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, `vol` is 7, and `j` is 4, we can calculate the new value of `vol` as follows:

- `j` is 4, so `2 ** j` is `2 ** 4`, which equals 16.
- Subtracting 1 from 16 gives 15.

Therefore, `vol` is updated to 15. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `vol` is 15, `j` is 4**
