Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program reads two integers `n` and `L` from the input, representing the number of bottle types and the required amount of lemonade, respectively. This is correctly done with `n, L = map(int, input().split())`.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the costs of each bottle type with `costs = list(map(int, input().split()))`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a DP array `dp` of size `L + 1` with all values set to infinity (`float('inf')`). This represents the minimum cost to obtain each volume of lemonade up to `L` liters.
   - `dp[0]` is set to 0 because it costs 0 roubles to obtain 0 liters of lemonade.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each volume `i` from 1 to `L`, the program iterates over each bottle type `j`. 
   - It calculates the volume of the current bottle type as `vol = 2 ** j - 1`.
   - If the volume of the current bottle is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `dp[i]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`. This ensures that `dp[i]` stores the minimum cost to achieve `i` liters of lemonade.

4. **Result Output**:
   - After filling the DP table, the program prints `dp[L]` if it is not infinity. If `dp[L]` is still infinity, it means it is not possible to obtain `L` liters of lemonade, and the program prints `-1`.

This implementation ensures that the program will find the minimum cost to obtain at least `L` liters of lemonade by considering all possible combinations of bottle types. The dynamic programming approach efficiently handles the constraints given in the problem description, making it a correct solution for all valid inputs within the specified limits.
