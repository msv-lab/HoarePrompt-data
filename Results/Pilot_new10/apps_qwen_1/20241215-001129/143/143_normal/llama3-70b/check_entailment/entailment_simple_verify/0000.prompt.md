You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----

Input

Output
30

Input

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum cost to buy at least L liters of lemonade using dynamic programming. Here's why:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with infinity values, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 0 because no cost is needed to buy 0 liters of lemonade.
2. **Volume Calculation**: For each volume `vol` from 2^0 - 1 to 2^n - 1, the program checks if this volume can be used to reach a particular amount of lemonade `i`.
3. **Cost Update**: If the volume can be used, the program updates the cost for the current amount of lemonade `i` by considering the cost of the current volume type.
4. **Final Result**: The program returns the cost stored in `dp[L]`, which represents the minimum cost to buy at least L liters of lemonade. If no valid solution is found, it returns -1.

After reviewing the program and the logic, I could not find any edge cases or specific inputs where the program would fail to meet the requirements described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and L are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30 and 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9. c is a list of n integers where each c_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, L = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `L+1`, `L` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `vol` is a positive integer that depends on `j` (where `vol` = 2^j - 1 for each iteration), `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to achieve the value `L` using the given costs, `j` is the last value of `j` used in the loop.
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
