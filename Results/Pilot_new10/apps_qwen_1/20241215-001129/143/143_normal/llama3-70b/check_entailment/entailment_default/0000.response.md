Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming. However, there is an issue with the calculation of the volume of each bottle type. Specifically, the volume of the bottle type \(i\) should be \(2^i - 1\), but the code incorrectly calculates it as \(2^i - 1\) starting from \(i = 1\), which leads to incorrect volumes. For instance, for \(i = 1\), the volume should be \(2^1 - 1 = 1\) liter, but the code calculates it as \(2^1 - 1 = 1\) liter, which is correct. However, for \(i = 2\), the volume should be \(2^2 - 1 = 3\) liters, but the code incorrectly calculates it as \(2^2 - 1 = 3\) liters, which is also correct, but the issue arises when considering the range and the loop condition.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  4 12
  20 30 70 90
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - Buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each, totaling 150 roubles.

However, due to the incorrect volume calculation, the code might not handle this correctly, leading to a different or incorrect solution.

A corrected version of the code would be:

```python
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        vol = 2 ** i - 1
        for j in range(L, vol - 1, -1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - vol] + costs[i])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)
```

This corrected version ensures that the volume is correctly calculated as \(2^i - 1\) for each bottle type, and the dynamic programming table is updated accordingly.
