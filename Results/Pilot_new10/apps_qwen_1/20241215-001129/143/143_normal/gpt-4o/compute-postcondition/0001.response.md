The code initializes a list `dp` with the value `max_cost` (which is 10) repeated 31 times. This overwrites the previous values of the elements in the `dp` list. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n positive integers where each element represents the cost of a bottle of lemonade of a specific type with 1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n, and `max_cost` is 10; `dp` is a list of 31 elements, each equal to 10.**
