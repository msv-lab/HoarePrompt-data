The code initializes `max_cost` to `10 ** 18`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `L`, or the `costs` list. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `max_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n positive integers where each element represents the cost of a bottle of lemonade of a specific type with 1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n, and `max_cost` is 10 ** 18.**
