According to the code, the loop iterates from `i = 30` down to `i = 0`. The loop can execute as long as `i` is within this range.

Let's break down the required states step-by-step:

1. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - The initial value of `i` is given as 30.
   
2. **Range Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `i` from 30 down to 0. Therefore, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Variable `c[i]`:**
   - The problem statement mentions that `c[i]` remains unchanged for all \(0 \leq i < n\). This means `c[i]` is already set for the range of interest (from 0 to 29).

4. **Variable `dp[i]`:**
   - The value of `dp[i]` for each \(1 \leq i \leq 30\) is defined as the minimum value between the original value of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. This condition is met based on the problem statement, so no adjustment is needed here.

5. **Variables `answer` and `current_cost`:**
   - The initial values of these variables are given as `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, and `current_cost` is 0. These values do not affect the loop's ability to execute; they are updated during the loop body.

Given the above points, we only need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 30 and that `i` remains within the range from 30 down to 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` is 30
- `i` must remain greater than or equal to 0

The final answer is:
State: **`i` is 30, `i` must remain greater than or equal to 0**
