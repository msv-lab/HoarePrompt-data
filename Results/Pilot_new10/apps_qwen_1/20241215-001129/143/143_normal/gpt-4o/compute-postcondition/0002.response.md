The code `c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))` creates a new list `c` by concatenating the list `costs` with a repeated list of `max_cost`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `costs` is a list of n positive integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9.
2. `max_cost` is 10.
3. `c` is initialized as `costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))`.

Since `len(costs)` is `n`, the expression `[max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))` results in a list with `31 - n` occurrences of `max_cost` (which is 10).

Therefore, `c` will be a list of length 31, where the first `n` elements are the same as the `costs` list, and the remaining `31 - n` elements are all 10.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n positive integers where each element represents the cost of a bottle of lemonade of a specific type with 1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n, and `max_cost` is 10; `dp` is a list of 31 elements, each equal to 10; `c` is a list of 31 elements where the first `n` elements are the same as `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are all 10.**
