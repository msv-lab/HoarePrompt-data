The code `L -= 1 << i` performs the following operations:
- `1 << i` shifts the binary number 1 left by `i` positions, which results in a number with a 1 in the `i`-th position and 0s elsewhere. Given `i` is 28, this operation results in `2^28`.
- `L -= 2^28` subtracts `2^28` from `L`.

From the initial state:
- `i` is 28.
- `current_cost` is either `current_cost` (if `L < 2^{28}`) or `current_cost + dp[28]` (if `L >= 2^{28}`).
- `answer` is the minimum between its current value and `current_cost + dp[28]` if `L > 0`, or `current_cost` if `L <= 0`.
- `L` is either `L` (if `L < 2^{28}`) or `L - 2^{28}` (if `L >= 2^{28}`).

Given the operation `L -= 1 << i`, if `L >= 2^{28}`, then `L` will be decreased by `2^{28}`. The value of `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `L` is decreased by `2^{28}` if `L >= 2^{28}`.
- `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`.

Output State: **`i` is 28, `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[28]`, `answer` is the minimum between its current value and `current_cost + dp[28]` if `L > 0`, or `current_cost` if `L <= 0`, and `L` is `L - 2^{28}` if `L >= 2^{28}`.**
