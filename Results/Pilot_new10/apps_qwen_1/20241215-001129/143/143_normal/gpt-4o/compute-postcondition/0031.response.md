`current_cost` is updated by adding `dp[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 28, the new value of `current_cost` is the old value of `current_cost` plus `dp[28]`. The values of `L`, `answer`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 28, `current_cost` is either `current_cost` (if `L < 2^{28}`) or `current_cost + dp[28]` (if `L >= 2^{28}`), `answer` is the minimum between its current value and `current_cost + dp[28]` if `L > 0`, or `current_cost` if `L <= 0`, and `L` is either `L` (if `L < 2^{28}`) or `L - 2^{28}` (if `L >= 2^{28}`); `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`**
