The code snippet `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. Given that `i` is initially 2, this line of code will specifically update `dp[2]`.

- Initially, `dp[2]` is the minimum value between the original value of `dp[2]` and `c[2]`.
- After executing the code, `dp[2]` will be updated to the minimum of its original value and `dp[1] * 2`.

Since `dp[1]` remains the same, let's denote the value of `dp[1]` as `dp_1_value`. Therefore, the new value of `dp[2]` will be `min(original_dp_2_value, dp_1_value * 2)`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `c[i]` remains unchanged for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp[1]` remains the same, `dp[2]` is min(`original_dp_2_value`, `dp_1_value` * 2)**
