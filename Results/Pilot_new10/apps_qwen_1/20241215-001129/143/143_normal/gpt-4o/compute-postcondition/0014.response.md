Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `c[i]` remains unchanged for all \(0 \leq i < n\)
   - `dp[1]` remains the same
   - `dp[2]` is min(`original_dp_2_value`, `dp_1_value` * 2)

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, 31):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = 30`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value of 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` changes to 3.
   - The conditions for `c[i]`, `dp[1]`, and `dp[2]` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `c[i]` remains unchanged for all \(0 \leq i < n\)
   - `dp[1]` remains the same
   - `dp[2]` remains min(`original_dp_2_value`, `dp_1_value` * 2) (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `c[i]` remains unchanged for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp[1]` remains the same, `dp[2]` remains min(`original_dp_2_value`, `dp_1_value` * 2)**
