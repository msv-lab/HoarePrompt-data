The code snippet `dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `c[i]`. However, without knowing the initial values of `dp[i]` and `c[i]`, we cannot determine the exact updated value of `dp[i]`. We only know that `dp[i]` is now the smaller of its original value and `c[i]`.

Given this, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `c[i]`; `c[i]` remains unchanged**.
