Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem. Specifically, the code does not simulate the traversal of the binary tree as per the given rules. Instead, it attempts to calculate a sum based on the binary representation of `n`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

For instance, consider the input `2 3`. According to the problem description, the traversal should follow the sequence "LRLRLRL...". For `h=2` and `n=3`, the correct traversal would be:
1. Start at the root.
2. Move left to node 2.
3. Move right to node 4 (skip since it's a non-existent node).
4. Move up to the parent node.
5. Move left to node 3 (exit).

This should result in visiting 5 nodes (excluding the exit node). However, the code incorrectly computes the number of visited nodes as 4, which is not correct. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
