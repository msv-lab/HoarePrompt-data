The function reads two integers `h` and `n` from input where `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`. It calculates a sum `ans` by iterating over the binary representation of `n`, halving `n` each time and adding either `n // 2 - 1` or `n // 2` to `ans` depending on whether `n` is even or odd. The function then prints the final value of `ans`.
