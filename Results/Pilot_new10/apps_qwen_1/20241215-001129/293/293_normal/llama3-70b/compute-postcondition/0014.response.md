Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `n` is `n_initial // 2`
- `ans` is updated based on the initial value of `n_initial`:
  - If `n_initial` was even, `ans` was incremented by `(n_initial // 2 - 1)`
  - If `n_initial` was odd, `ans` was incremented by `n_initial // 2`

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `while n > 1`.

### Loop Execution
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `n > 1` must be true at the start of the next iteration.

### Current State
- `n` is currently `n_initial // 2`
- For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is initially set to `n_initial // 2`, the only way for `n` to be greater than 1 after the first iteration is if `n_initial` was initially greater than 2.

### Adjusting the State
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 1.

### Updated State
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- The relationship between `n` and `n_initial` is `n = n_initial // 2`, so `n_initial` must be greater than 2 for `n` to be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
