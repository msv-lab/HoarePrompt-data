Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `h` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\)
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\)
- `ans` is 0

### Code of the Loop:
```python
while n > 1:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        ans += n // 2 - 1
    else:
        ans += n // 2
    n //= 2
```

### Analysis:

1. **First Iteration:**
   - If `n` is even: `ans` is incremented by `n // 2 - 1`
   - If `n` is odd: `ans` is incremented by `n // 2`
   - `n` is halved (`n //= 2`)

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - After the first iteration, `n` is halved again.
   - Depending on whether `n` was even or odd, `ans` is updated accordingly.

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - After the second iteration, `n` is halved again.
   - `ans` is updated based on the current value of `n`.

4. **General Case:**
   - This process continues until `n` becomes 1.
   - Each iteration reduces `n` by half, and `ans` is updated based on the current value of `n`.

### Final Output State:
- After the loop completes, `n` will be 1 because the loop continues only if `n > 1`.
- The value of `ans` will be the sum of a specific series based on the initial value of `n`.

To find the exact value of `ans`, we need to consider the series formed by the operations within the loop.

### Summing the Series:
- If `n` starts as an even number, say \(2k\), the operations would be:
  - First iteration: \(ans += k - 1\), \(n = k\)
  - Second iteration: \(ans += k // 2\), \(n = k // 2\)
  - And so on...

- If `n` starts as an odd number, say \(2k + 1\), the operations would be:
  - First iteration: \(ans += k\), \(n = k + 1\)
  - Second iteration: \(ans += (k + 1) // 2\), \(n = (k + 1) // 2\)
  - And so on...

In both cases, the loop effectively reduces `n` by half each time and adds a term to `ans` based on the current value of `n`.

### Conclusion:
- After the loop finishes, `n` will be 1.
- `ans` will be the sum of the series formed by the loop operations.

Thus, the output state after the loop has executed is:
Output State: **`n` is 1, `ans` is the sum of the series formed by the loop operations based on the initial value of `n`.**
