`n` is divided by 2 using floor division (`//`), which means `n` is updated to its value divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest whole number. The initial state is that `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans + n // 2`. After executing `n //= 2`, the value of `n` is halved (and rounded down if necessary), and the initial condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains valid.

Since the exact initial value of `n` is not given, we can represent the updated state in terms of the original value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + n // 2`, and `n` must still be greater than 1.**
