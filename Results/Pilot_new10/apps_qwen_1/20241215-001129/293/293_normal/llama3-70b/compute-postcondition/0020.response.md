The code simply prints the value of `ans`. Since the value of `ans` is not changed by this line of code, the value of `ans` remains the same as it was before the print statement, which is the sum of the series formed by the loop operations based on the initial value of `n`, and in this case, `n` is 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is 1, `ans` is the sum of the series formed by the loop operations based on the initial value of `n`.**
