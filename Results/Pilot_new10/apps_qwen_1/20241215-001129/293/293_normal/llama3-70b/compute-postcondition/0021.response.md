The function `func` accepts two parameters: `h` and `n`. 

- `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h.

Case_1: If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 2^h, the function returns an error message indicating that `n` is out of the valid range.
Case_2: If `n` is within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h), the function does not explicitly return anything from the given information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `h` and `n`, where `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^h inclusive. The function returns an error message if `n` is outside its valid range, and does not return anything if `n` is within its valid range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `h` and `n`, returns an error message if `n` is out of the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h), and does not return anything if `n` is within its valid range.**
