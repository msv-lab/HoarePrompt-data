`ans` is assigned the value of `ans + (n // 2 - 1)`. Since `n` must be greater than 1, `n // 2 - 1` will be a specific integer depending on the value of `n`. The initial state says `n` must be greater than 1, but the exact value of `n` is not specified. Therefore, the value of `ans` will be updated by adding `n // 2 - 1` to its current value. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2 - 1` to its current value**
