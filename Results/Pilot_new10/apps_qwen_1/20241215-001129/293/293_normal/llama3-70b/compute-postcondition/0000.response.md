The code `h, n = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input and assigns them to `h` and `n` respectively. The initial conditions are that `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\) and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\). After executing the code, the values of `h` and `n` are updated based on the input, but the constraints remain.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^`h`.**
