The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` updates the value of `current_node`. Given the initial state:

- `total_leaves` is \(2^h\)
- `visited_count` is 2
- `path` is non-empty (with one less element)
- `current_level` is 1
- `direction` is the first element of the updated `path`

The initial value of `current_node` is not explicitly given, but we know that before this line of code, `current_node` was set to some value, possibly related to the structure of the tree or a specific level.

Since the exact initial value of `current_node` is not specified, let's denote it as \(n\). After executing the code, the new value of `current_node` will be \(2 \times n + 1\).

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `current_node` is \(2 \times current_node + 1\)
- `total_leaves` remains \(2^h\)
- `visited_count` remains 2
- `path` remains non-empty (with one less element)
- `current_level` remains 1
- `direction` remains the first element of the updated `path`

Output State: **`total_leaves` is \(2^h\), `visited_count` is 2, `path` is non-empty (with one less element), `current_level` is 1, `direction` is the first element of the updated `path`, `current_node` is \(2 \times current_node + 1\)**
