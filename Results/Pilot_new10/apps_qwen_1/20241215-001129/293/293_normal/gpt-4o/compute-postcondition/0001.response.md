The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `h` and `n` respectively. The initial constraints for `h` and `n` are that `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\) inclusive. After executing the code, these constraints still apply to `h` and `n`. The values of `h` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ \(2^h\)**
