The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` updates the value of `current_node` based on its previous value. Initially, `current_node` is 0. Applying the operation:

- `current_node` is updated to `2 * 0 + 2`, which results in `2`.

All other variables remain unchanged: `total_leaves` is \(2^h\), `visited_count` is 1, `path` is non-empty, `current_level` is 0, and `direction` is not '0'.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is \(2^h\), `visited_count` is 1, `path` is non-empty, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 2, `direction` is not '0'**
