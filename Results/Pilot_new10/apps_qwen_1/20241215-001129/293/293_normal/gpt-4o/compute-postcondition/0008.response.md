`visited_count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `visited_count` is 0, so after the increment, `visited_count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is \(2^h\), `visited_count` is 1, `path` is non-empty, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 0**
