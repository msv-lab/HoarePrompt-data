The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` impacts the variable `current_node`. Initially, `current_node` is either \(2 \times current_node + 1\) or 4. Let's consider both cases:

1. If `current_node` is \(2 \times current_node + 1\):
   - This equation implies that `current_node` is 1 (since \(2 \times 1 + 1 = 3\), but the initial condition is that `current_node` is either \(2 \times current_node + 1\) or 4, which means this case is not directly solvable from the given form but let's assume the form is correctly representing the initial state).
   - After executing the code, `current_node` becomes \(2 \times 1 + 1 = 3\).

2. If `current_node` is 4:
   - After executing the code, `current_node` becomes \(2 \times 4 + 1 = 9\).

Since the initial state specifies that `current_node` is either \(2 \times current_node + 1\) or 4, we consider both possibilities in the output state. However, since the exact initial value is specified as 4 in one of the conditions, we take that as the primary condition.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is \(2^h\), `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty list with two less elements, `current_level` is 1, `current_node` is 9**
