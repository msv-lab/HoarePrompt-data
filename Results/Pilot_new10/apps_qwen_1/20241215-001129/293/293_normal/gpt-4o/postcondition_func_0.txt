The function reads two integers `h` and `n` from standard input, constructs a binary path from `n-1`, traverses this path to determine the number of nodes visited, and prints the count of visited nodes. The function assumes valid inputs within the specified ranges (1 ≤ h ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h) and does not handle out-of-range or invalid inputs.
