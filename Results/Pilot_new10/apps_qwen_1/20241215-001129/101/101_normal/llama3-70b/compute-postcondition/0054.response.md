The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` updates the value of `pixels[i][j]` to `'+'`. Given the initial state, the values of `i` and `j` are known (`i` is 1 and `j` is 1), so `pixels[1][1]` is set to `'+'`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, and `pixels` for other indices) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list with `pixels[1][1]` equal to `'+'`, `j` is 1**
