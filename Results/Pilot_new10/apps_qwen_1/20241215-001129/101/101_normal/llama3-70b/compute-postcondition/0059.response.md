According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop condition is that `j` must be less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`.

To determine the necessary adjustments:

1. The current value of `j` is 1.
2. `m` must be greater than 0.
3. For the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. Since `m` is not specified as having any particular value beyond being greater than 0, we cannot make any assumption about its exact value, but it must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and `m` must remain greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list, `j` is 2**
