Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each row in the `pixels` list using `for row in pixels`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `pixels` is a non-empty 2D list with at least one row.
   - `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels.
   - `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels.
   - `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels.
   - `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels.
   - `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\) and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.
   - `row` is the next row in the `pixels` list, printed as a single string by joining its elements.
   - The current row is printed to the console.

3. **Determine What Needs to Change for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the rows in the `pixels` list, the loop will continue to the next row in the list.
   - Therefore, `row` will be the next row in the `pixels` list after the current one.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The state of `n` and `m` remains unchanged as they are not being modified within the loop.
   - `pixels` will now be the remaining rows in the list after the current row has been processed.
   - `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged as they are calculated from the entire `pixels` list and are not modified within the loop.
   - `frame_size` remains unchanged as it is a derived value based on `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`, which are not being modified.
   - `row` will be the next row in the `pixels` list.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `pixels` is a 2D list with at least one row (but now the first row has been processed).
   - `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels.
   - `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels.
   - `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels.
   - `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels.
   - `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\) and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.
   - `row` is the next row in the `pixels` list, printed as a single string by joining its elements.
   - The current row is printed to the console.

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; `pixels` is a 2D list with at least one row; `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels; `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels; `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels; `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels; `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\) and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`; `row` is the next row in the `pixels` list, printed as a single string by joining its elements; the current row is printed to the console.**
