According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `i` is 2,
- `n` must be greater than 0,
- `m` must be greater than 0,
- `j` must be less than `m`.

The loop checks the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.'`, and if true, sets `pixels[2][j]` to '+'. If `pixels[2][j]` is 'w', no change occurs. Otherwise, `pixels[2][j]` is set to '.'.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
1. The value of `j` will increase by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must be less than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `j+1`, and it must still satisfy the condition `j < m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` remains 2,
- `n` must be greater than 0,
- `m` must be greater than 0,
- `j` must be less than `m` (and specifically, `j` will be incremented to `j+1`).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` must be less than `m`**
