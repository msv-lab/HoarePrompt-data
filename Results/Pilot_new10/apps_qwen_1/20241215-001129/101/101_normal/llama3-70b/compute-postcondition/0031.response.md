The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of variables outside of the loop. The initial conditions and values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` must be less than `m`**
