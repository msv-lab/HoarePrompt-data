Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `pixels` is a 2D list, `j` is 0. If `i` is either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and the pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` list is `'.'`, then the pixel at position `(i, j)` is set to `'+'`. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, no change occurs. If `pixels[i][j]` is anything other than `'w'`, it is set to `'.'`. The condition `(i != min_x and i != max_x and j != min_y and j != max_y) or pixels[i][j] != '.'` still holds true.**
