The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` assigns the value `'.'` to the element in the `pixels` list at index `i` and sub-index `j`. The initial state of `i` is 0 and `j` must be less than `m`, which is greater than 0. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `j` must be less than `m`; `pixels[0][j]` is `'.'`**
