Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; `pixels` is an `n x m` 2D list with at least one row; `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels; `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels; `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels; `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels; `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\) and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`; after executing the loop, all boundary pixels (where `i` is `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` is `min_y` or `max_y`) are set to `'+'`, and all other pixels are either `'.'` or `'w'`.**
