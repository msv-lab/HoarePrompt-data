Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list, `j` is 1. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[1][1]` is set to `'.'`. Otherwise, if `pixels[1][1]` equals `'w'`, no changes occur. If none of the conditions above are met, `pixels[1][1]` remains unchanged.**
