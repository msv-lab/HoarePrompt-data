The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `pixels`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list, `j` is 2**
