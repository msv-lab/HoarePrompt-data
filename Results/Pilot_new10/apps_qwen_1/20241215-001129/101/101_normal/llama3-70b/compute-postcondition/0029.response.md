According to the given code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`. The loop body is omitted, but we know that if certain conditions are met, the pixel at position `(i, j)` is modified.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` must be greater than 0

The conditions under which the pixel at position `(i, j)` remains `'+'` or is set to `'.'` depend on the values of `i`, `j`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y`.

Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will continue as long as `j` is within the valid range (from 0 to `m-1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m`.

Let's summarize the states that need to be adjusted:

- `n` must still be greater than 0
- `i` remains 0
- `m` must still be greater than 0
- `j` must be less than `m`

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` must be less than `m`**
