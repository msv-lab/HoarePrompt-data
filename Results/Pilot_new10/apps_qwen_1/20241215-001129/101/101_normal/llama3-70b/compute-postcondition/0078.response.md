The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `+` to the element in the `pixels` list at index `i` and `j`. Given the initial conditions, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, but the value at `pixels[i][j]` is updated.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` must be less than `m`, `pixels[2][j]` is '+'**
