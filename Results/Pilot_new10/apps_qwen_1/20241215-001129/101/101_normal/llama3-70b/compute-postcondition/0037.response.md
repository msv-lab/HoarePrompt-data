The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. The variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `j` must be less than `m`.**
