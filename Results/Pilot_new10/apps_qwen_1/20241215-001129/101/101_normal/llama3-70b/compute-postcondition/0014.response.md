The code calculates the `frame_size` based on the difference between the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates of all white pixels, and adds 1 to the result. This calculation does not affect any other variables. 

Let's denote the differences as follows:
- \( \text{difference}_x = \max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}) \)
- \( \text{difference}_y = \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y}) \)

The frame size is then given by:
\[ \text{frame\_size} = \max(\text{difference}_x, \text{difference}_y) + 1 \]

Therefore, the output state will include the updated `frame_size` and keep all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels, `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\)**
