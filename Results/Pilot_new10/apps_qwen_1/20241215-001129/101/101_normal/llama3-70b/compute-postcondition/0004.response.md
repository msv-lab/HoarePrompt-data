According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `white_pixels`. The loop will execute if there is at least one tuple (x, y) in `white_pixels`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, and `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'. The variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are initialized to `float('inf')`, `float('inf')`, `float('-inf')`, and `float('-inf')` respectively.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `white_pixels` is not empty. If `white_pixels` is empty, the loop will not execute because there are no tuples (x, y) to iterate over.

3. **State Adjustments**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `white_pixels` is not empty. This means there should be at least one tuple (x, y) in `white_pixels`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `white_pixels` is not empty.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', and `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple (x, y), `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are initialized to `float('inf')`, `float('inf')`, `float('-inf')`, `float('-inf')` respectively.**
