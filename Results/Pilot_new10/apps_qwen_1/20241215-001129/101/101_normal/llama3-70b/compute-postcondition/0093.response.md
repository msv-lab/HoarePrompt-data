According to the code, the loop iterates over each row in the `pixels` 2D list. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer
- `pixels` is a non-empty 2D list with at least one row
- `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels
- `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels
- `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels
- `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels
- `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\) and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`
- `row` is printed as a single string by joining its elements

For the loop to execute one more time, the next row in the `pixels` list must be processed. This means that the `row` variable will be assigned the next row in the `pixels` list.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration of the loop:
- The `row` variable will be assigned the next row in the `pixels` list.
- All other states remain the same.

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; `pixels` is a non-empty 2D list with at least one row; `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels; `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels; `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels; `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels; `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\) and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`; `row` is the next row in the `pixels` list, printed as a single string by joining its elements**
