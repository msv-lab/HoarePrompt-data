The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input which consists of two space-separated integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of the monitor, followed by `n` lines each containing `m` characters. The characters are either '.' (black pixel) or 'w' (white pixel), with at least one 'w' present in the input. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read the dimensions and pixel data of a monitor from the standard input and process it according to the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` followed by `n` lines each containing `m` characters (either '.' or 'w'), and processes the input accordingly.**
