The code updates `max_x` and `max_y` with the maximum values between their current values and the provided `x` and `y` values. Given that `x1` is the value of `min_x` and `y1` is the value of `min_y`, the new values of `max_x` and `max_y` will be the maximum values among `x1`, `min_x`, and `x`, and `y1`, `min_y`, and `y`, respectively. 

Since the initial values of `max_x` and `max_y` are `x1` and `y1` (which are `float('-inf')`), the values of `max_x` and `max_y` will be updated to the maximum values between `x1` and `x`, and `y1` and `y`, respectively.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', `min_x` is `x1`, `min_y` is `y1`, `max_x` is max(`x1`, `x`), `max_y` is max(`y1`, `y`).**
