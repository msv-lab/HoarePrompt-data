The code `print(''.join(row))` joins the elements of the `row` list into a single string and prints it. The `row` variable is the next row in the `pixels` list, and it is already formatted as a string. This operation does not change the values of any variables except potentially printing the content of `row`.

Since the print statement does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the content of the `row` variable is printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; `pixels` is a 2D list with at least one row; `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels; `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels; `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels; `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels; `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\) and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`; the content of `row` is printed to the console.**
