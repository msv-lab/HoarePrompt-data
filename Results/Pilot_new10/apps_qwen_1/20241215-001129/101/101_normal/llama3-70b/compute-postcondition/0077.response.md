To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `pixels` is a 2D list where all boundary pixels are set to `'+'` and all other pixels are set to `'.'` unless they are `'w'`, in which case they remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`. This means that the loop is currently iterating over `j`.

3. **Condition to Continue Loop**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `j < m` must hold true. Since `i` is fixed at 2 and `j` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m`.

4. **State Adjustment**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, if `j` was previously some value `k`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Boundary Conditions**: The loop will stop when `j` equals `m`. Hence, at the start of the next iteration, `j` must be less than `m` to ensure the loop continues.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` remains `2`.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `m` must still be greater than 0.
- `j` must be less than `m`.

Since `i` and `m` are constants relative to the loop, we focus on adjusting `j`:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` must be less than `m`**
