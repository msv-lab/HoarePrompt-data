Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where all boundary pixels are set to `'+'` and all other pixels are set to `'.'` unless they are `'w'`, in which case they remain unchanged. If the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'` and the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` is true, then the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) is set to `'+'`. Otherwise, if the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`. Otherwise, the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) is set to `'.'`.***
