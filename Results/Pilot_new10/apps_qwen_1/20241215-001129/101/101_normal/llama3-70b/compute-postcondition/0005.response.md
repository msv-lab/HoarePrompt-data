The code updates the `min_x` and `min_y` variables by finding the minimum `x` and `y` values from the `white_pixels` list. Initially, `min_x` and `min_y` are set to `float('inf')`.

Given that `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple `(x, y)` and considering the nature of `float('inf')` which represents infinity, the smallest finite `x` and `y` values from `white_pixels` will replace the current values of `min_x` and `min_y`.

Let's denote the first tuple in `white_pixels` as `(x1, y1)`. Since `min_x` and `min_y` start at infinity, they will be updated to `x1` and `y1`, respectively.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', `min_x` is `x1`, `min_y` is `y1`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is `float('-inf')`.**
