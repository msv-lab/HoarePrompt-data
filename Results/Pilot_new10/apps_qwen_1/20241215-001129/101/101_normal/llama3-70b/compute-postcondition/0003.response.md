The code initializes four variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` with special values (`float('inf')` for minimums and `float('-inf')` for maximums). These variables are used to track the smallest and largest indices of white pixels in the `pixels` list. The initial states of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, and `white_pixels` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows; `m` is an integer representing the number of columns; `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters; `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'; `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are initialized to `float('inf')`, `float('inf')`, `float('-inf')`, `float('-inf')` respectively.**
