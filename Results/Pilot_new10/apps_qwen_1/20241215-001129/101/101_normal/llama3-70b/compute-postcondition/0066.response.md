According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 and `n` must still be greater than 0.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `pixels` is a 2D list where boundary pixels are set to `'+'` and internal pixels are set to `'.'` unless they are `'w'`, which remain unchanged.

2. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue, we increment `i` from 1 to 2.
   - The condition for `n` remains the same; it must be greater than 0.

Thus, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration are:

- `i` is now 2
- `n` must still be greater than 0
- `m` remains greater than 0
- `pixels` remains as described

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `pixels` is a 2D list where all boundary pixels (where `i` is `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` is `min_y` or `max_y`) are set to `'+'` and all other pixels are set to `'.'` unless they are `'w'`, in which case they remain unchanged.**
