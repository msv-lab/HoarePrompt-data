The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` assigns the value `'.'` to the element in the `pixels` list at index `i` and column index `j`. Given the initial conditions, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `j` are not directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the only affected variable is `pixels`, which now has a new value at `pixels[2][j]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` must be less than `m`, `pixels[2][j]` is '.'**
