Let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of rows.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of columns.
- `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters.
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples \((i, j)\) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'.
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are initialized to `float('inf')`, `float('inf')`, `float('-inf')`, `float('-inf')` respectively.

### Loop Code:
```python
for x, y in white_pixels:
    min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
    max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop iterates over each tuple \((x, y)\) in `white_pixels`.
- For each iteration, it updates `min_x` and `min_y` to be the minimum of the current values and the current coordinates \(x\) and \(y\).
- Similarly, it updates `max_x` and `max_y` to be the maximum of the current values and the current coordinates \(x\) and \(y\).

### Understanding the Output States:
- After 1 iteration, `min_x` and `min_y` are updated to the minimum values of the coordinates, and `max_x` and `max_y` are updated to the maximum values of the coordinates.
- After 2 iterations, the same process is repeated with the next pair of coordinates, updating `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` accordingly.
- This continues until all pairs in `white_pixels` have been processed.

### Final Output State:
- After all iterations, `min_x` and `min_y` will be the smallest \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates among all the white pixels.
- Similarly, `max_x` and `max_y` will be the largest \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates among all the white pixels.
- The variables `n`, `m`, `pixels`, and `white_pixels` retain their original values since they are not modified by the loop.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop executes at least once, it means `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple.
- Therefore, the final state of the loop will be that `min_x` and `min_y` are the smallest \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates of all white pixels, and `max_x` and `max_y` are the largest \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates of all white pixels.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels.**
