Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly identify the smallest possible square frame around the white pixels. The output hints confirm that the function aims to set the boundary pixels to '+' and internal pixels to '.', but the implementation fails to ensure that the frame is of the smallest possible size. For example, in the given test case:

**Input:**
```
3 3
.w.
...
.w.
```

The expected output is:
```
+++
+++
+++
```

However, the actual output is:
```
.w.
...
.w.
```

This indicates that the program is not updating the pixels to form the smallest possible frame. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is accurate.
