Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the found frame is the smallest possible frame that satisfies the conditions. Here are the key issues:

1. **Frame Size Calculation**: The program calculates the size of the bounding box (i.e., the smallest rectangle containing all white pixels) as the potential frame. However, this does not guarantee that the resulting frame will have a width of 1 pixel, which is a crucial requirement.

2. **Frame Width Check**: The program does not explicitly check if the calculated bounding box can be converted into a frame with a width of 1 pixel. The bounding box might be larger than necessary because it includes all white pixels, even those that are not on the border.

3. **Output Formatting**: While the program correctly outputs the monitor state with the frame marked as `+` and the white pixels as `w`, it does not ensure that the frame is the smallest possible one with a width of 1 pixel.

To meet the problem requirements, the program needs to:
- Identify the smallest possible bounding box that can be converted into a frame with a width of 1 pixel.
- Ensure that all white pixels are on the border of this frame.
- Output the frame as `+` and keep the white pixels as `w`.

The current implementation only ensures that all white pixels are within the bounding box but does not guarantee that the resulting frame will have the smallest possible size with a width of 1 pixel.
