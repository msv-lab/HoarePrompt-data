Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the smallest possible frame that encompasses all white pixels while ensuring that the frame does not go beyond the borders of the screen. The output hints align with the functionality of the `func_1` function, confirming that it correctly identifies the boundaries of the white region and constructs the frame using '+' characters if possible. The code handles all the necessary edge cases, such as returning -1 if no valid frame exists or if the resulting frame dimensions are less than 2x2. The examples provided in the output hints also demonstrate that the code works as expected for various scenarios.
