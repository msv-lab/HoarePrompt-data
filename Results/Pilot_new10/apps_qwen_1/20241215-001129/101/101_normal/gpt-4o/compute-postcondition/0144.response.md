Output State: **`total` is not mentioned and remains unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `m`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is the smallest row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each column `j` from `0` to `m-1`. If a 'w' is found, the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` values are updated accordingly.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop only updates when `screen[i][j] == 'w'`, and `i` starts at 1. If no 'w' is found in any of the rows, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will remain their initial values of `None`.

Since the loop iterates over all columns for each row and checks each character, after the loop completes:
- `top` will be the smallest row index where 'w' was found (or `None` if no 'w' was found).
- `bottom` will be the largest row index where 'w' was found (or `None` if no 'w' was found).
- `left` will be the smallest column index where 'w' was found (or `None` if no 'w' was found).
- `right` will be the largest column index where 'w' was found (or `None` if no 'w' was found).

All other variables (`total`, `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, `screen`) will retain their final values after the loop completes.
