The code initializes four variables: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to `None`. These variables were not previously initialized to any specific values in the initial state, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, `screen` is a list of n strings where each string contains exactly m characters, and the characters in the strings are either "." (black pixels) or "w" (white pixels), `top` is `None`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`.**
