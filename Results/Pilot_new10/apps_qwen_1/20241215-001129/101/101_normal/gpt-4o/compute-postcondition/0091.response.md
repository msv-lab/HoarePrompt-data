Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is equal to the current value of `i`, `i` is equal to the current value of `bottom`, `j` is incremented by 1, `left` is `j`, `right` remains unchanged.***
