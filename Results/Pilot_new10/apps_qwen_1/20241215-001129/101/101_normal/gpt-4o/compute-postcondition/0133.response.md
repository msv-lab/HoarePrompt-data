The code `left = right = j` assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. From the initial state, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value but is still less than `m`. Therefore, `left` and `right` are both set to the current value of `j`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is still less than `m`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `j`, and `right` is `j`.**
