Postcondition: ***`total` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `j + 1`, `right` is `j + 1`***

Explanation: Since the if condition `i < top` is checked and `i` is already 1, which is equal to `top`, the if part does not execute. Therefore, the postcondition is the same as the precondition, with `j` incremented by 1, and `left` and `right` updated to `j + 1`.
