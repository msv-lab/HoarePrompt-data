The code sets both `left` and `right` to the value of `j`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 in the previous step. Since the previous state does not specify the exact value of `j`, we can denote it as `j`. Therefore, after the code is executed, `left` and `right` are both set to `j`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is the current value of `i`, `bottom` is the current value of `i`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`.**
