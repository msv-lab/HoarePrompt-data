Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `i` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq i \leq 2000\), `top` remains `0`, `left` remains `1`, and `right` remains `1`. If `i > bottom`, then `bottom` is set to `i`; otherwise, `bottom` remains unchanged.***
