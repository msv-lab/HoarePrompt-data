Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w". If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then:
- If `top` is `None`, `top` is updated to `i`, `bottom` is updated to `i`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `left` is `j - 1`, and `right` is `j - 1`.
- Otherwise, `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is updated to `i`, `i` is equal to `bottom`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `left` is `j - 1`, `right` is updated to the previous value of `i` (or `bottom`) if `j` is greater than `right`.***
