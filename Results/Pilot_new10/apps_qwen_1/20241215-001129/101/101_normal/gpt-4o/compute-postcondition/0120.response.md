The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but the exact previous value of `j` is not specified. However, we know that `j` still satisfies the condition of being less than `m`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not mentioned and remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `j` is still less than `m`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`**
