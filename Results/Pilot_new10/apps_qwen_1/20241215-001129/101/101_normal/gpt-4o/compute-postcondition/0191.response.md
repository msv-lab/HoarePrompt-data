The code snippet updates the value of `result[i][j]` to `'+'` where `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `right`. This means the boundary elements of the `result` matrix are updated to `'+'`.

- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`.
- `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain the same.
- `frame_height` and `frame_width` remain the same.
- `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `j` is `right`, and the current value of `result[i][j]` is updated to `'+'`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `j` is `right`, the current value of `result[i][j]` is `'+'`.**
