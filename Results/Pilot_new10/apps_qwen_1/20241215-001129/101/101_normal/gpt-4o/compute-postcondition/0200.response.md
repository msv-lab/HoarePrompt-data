Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\); `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\); `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`; `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found; `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found; `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found; `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2; `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `right + 1`; if `result[i][j] == '.'`, it is changed to `'+'`; otherwise, the value of `result[i][j]` remains `'+'`. Since there is no else part, the value of `result[i][j]` remains `'+'` if it is not `'.'`.***
