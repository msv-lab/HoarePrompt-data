According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `n`, where `n` is the number of rows in the `screen` list. The loop starts from `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w"
- `top` is the smallest row index where 'w' is found
- `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found
- `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found
- `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found
- `i` is `0`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `1`.
- The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is the smallest row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found, `i` is `1`**.
