Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w". If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then `top` is `0`, `bottom` is `0`, `left` is `0`, and `right` is `0`. Otherwise, `top` is `0`, `bottom` is at most `i`, `left` is at most `j`, and `right` is either `j` or remains `1`.***
