The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `left`. The value of `j` does not change, and neither do `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `i`, and `right`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` remains unchanged if `i < top`, otherwise `top` is `i`; `bottom` is `i`; `i`, `j`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged; `left` is now `j`.**
