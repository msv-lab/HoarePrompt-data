Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w". `top` remains unchanged if `i < top`, otherwise `top` is `i`. `bottom` remains unchanged. `i`, `j`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program after executing the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts, as well as the unchanged variables.
