Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w". `top` is the smallest row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution Condition**: The nested loop iterates over every pixel in the `screen` matrix. If the condition `screen[i][j] == 'w'` is met, it updates the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` variables accordingly.
- **Initial Values**: Initially, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are set to `None`.
- **First Iteration**:
  - If `screen[0][0] == 'w'`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are initialized to `0`.
- **Subsequent Iterations**:
  - For each `'w'` encountered, the loop updates the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to the minimum and maximum row and column indices respectively.
- **Final State**: After all iterations, the final values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will be the smallest and largest row and column indices where `'w'` is present in the `screen`.

If no `'w'` is found in the `screen`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain `None`.

Thus, the loop correctly identifies the bounding box of white pixels (`'w'`) in the `screen` matrix.
