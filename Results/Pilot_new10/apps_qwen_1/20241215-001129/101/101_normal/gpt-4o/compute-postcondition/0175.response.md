The code snippet `result[i][j] = '+'` updates the value of `result[i][j]` to `'+'`. According to the precondition, the condition for updating `result[i][j]` to `'+'` is that `i` is equal to `top`, `i` is equal to `bottom`, `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`. 

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `right` is at least one more than `left` (`right >= left + 1`), and `result[i][j]` is `'+'` if `i == top` or `i == bottom` or `j == left` or `j == right`.**
