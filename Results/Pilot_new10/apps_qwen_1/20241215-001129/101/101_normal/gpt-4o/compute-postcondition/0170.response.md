Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each column within the frame defined by `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`.
- For each column `j` in this range, the loop checks if the current cell `result[i][j]` is on the boundary (either `top` or `bottom` row or `left` or `right` column).
- If the cell is on the boundary and its value is `'.'`, it is changed to `'+'`.
- Since the loop processes every column in the frame exactly once, all boundary cells will be marked with `'+'` after the loop completes.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` do not change during the loop and remain as they were initially, unless `top` or `bottom` or `left` or `right` are updated due to the presence of `'w'` in the screen. However, these conditions are not altered by the loop itself but are preconditions for the loop to start.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, the only change is that all boundary cells of the frame will be marked with `'+'` if they were originally `'.'`.
