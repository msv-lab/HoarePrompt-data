Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the columns from `left` to `right` inclusive. The loop condition is that `j` must be within this range.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
   - `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`.
   - `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found.
   - `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found.
   - `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found.
   - `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`.
   - `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`.
   - `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

3. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is the current column index, let's say it was `j = k` (where `k` is some value between `left` and `right`).
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to `k + 1` and `k + 1` must still be within the range `[left, right]`.

4. **Update the State**:
   - Since `j` is being incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `k + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `k + 1` must still be within the range `[left, right]`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width`) remain unchanged.

5. **Final State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
   - `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`.
   - `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found.
   - `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found.
   - `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found.
   - `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`.
   - `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`.
   - `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.
   - `j` is now `k + 1` (where `k` was the previous value of `j`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, `j` is the next column index (`k + 1`).**
