The code `right = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `right`. Based on the initial state, `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to the previous value of `i` (which is equal to `bottom`), and `right` was previously equal to `j`. Therefore, `right` is now also equal to the previous value of `i` (or `bottom`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is equal to the current value of `i`, `i` is equal to the current value of `bottom`, `j` is incremented by 1, `left` is `j`, `right` is equal to the previous value of `i` (or `bottom`).**
