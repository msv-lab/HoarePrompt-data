Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `total` is not mentioned and remains unchanged.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is the column index where 'w' is found (if any).
   - `j` satisfies the condition of being less than `m`.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
   - `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w".
   - `top` is 1.
   - `bottom` is 1.
   - `left` is `j`.
   - `right` is `j`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`. The loop body is omitted, but we need to determine how the state changes after the loop.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m`. Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the loop will run until `j` reaches `m-1`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is the column index where 'w' is found (if any) or has reached `m-1` if no 'w' was found.
   - `j` satisfies the condition of being less than `m`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - If a 'w' is found at `[1][j]`, then `j` will be updated to the column index where 'w' is found.
   - If no 'w' is found at `[1][j]` and `j` reaches `m-1`, then `j` will be `m-1` and the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will remain unchanged.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will start with the new value of `j`.
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 with each iteration, the new value of `j` will be the current value of `j` plus 1.

7. **Final State**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - If `j` was `m-1` and no 'w' was found, it will remain `m-1`.
   - If `j` was less than `m-1`, it will be incremented to the next column index.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- If `j` was `m-1` and no 'w' was found, it will remain `m-1`.
- If `j` was less than `m-1`, it will be incremented to the next column index.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is not mentioned and remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `j` must still satisfy the condition of being less than `m`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`.**
