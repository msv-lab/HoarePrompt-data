Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2000 \).
- \( m \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 2000 \).
- `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`.
- `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found.
- `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found.
- `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found.
- `right` is the largest column index where `'w'` is found.
- `frame_height` is \( \text{bottom} - \text{top} + 1 \) and is greater than or equal to 2.
- `frame_width` is \( \text{right} - \text{left} + 1 \) and is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
        if result[i][j] == '.':
            result[i][j] = '+'
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initially, `i` is `i + 1`, so we start the loop with `i` being the smallest row index (usually 0 or 1).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `j` in the range `[left, right]`:
     - If `i` is either `top` or `bottom` or `j` is either `left` or `right`:
       - If `result[i][j]` is `'.'`, change it to `'+'`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `bottom + 1` because it increments by 1 at the end of each iteration and the loop will terminate when `i` exceeds `bottom`.
   - `j` will be `right + 1` because it also increments by 1 after processing the entire range for `j`.

4. **Boundary Elements**:
   - All boundary elements of the frame will be set to `'+'` if they were originally `'.'`.
   - The frame boundaries are defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.

5. **Unchanged Variables**:
   - `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:

- After the loop executes, `i` will be `bottom + 1` and `j` will be `right + 1`.
- The boundary elements of the frame (`top` to `bottom` rows and `left` to `right` columns) will be set to `'+'` if they were originally `'.'`.

### Output State:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `bottom + 1` and `j` is `right + 1`. The boundary elements of the frame are set to `'+'` if they were originally `'.'`.**
