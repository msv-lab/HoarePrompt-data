The code sets `top` and `bottom` both to the current value of `i`. Since `i` is currently set to `n - 1`, both `top` and `bottom` will be updated to `n - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is `n - 1`, `bottom` is `n - 1`, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found, `i` is now `n - 1`, `j` is now `0`, and `top` is `n - 1` since no 'w' was found in the screen initially.**
