Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is either `i` or `None`, `bottom` is `0`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. The condition `(i > bottom)` is true, and the current value of `j` is less than `left`.**
