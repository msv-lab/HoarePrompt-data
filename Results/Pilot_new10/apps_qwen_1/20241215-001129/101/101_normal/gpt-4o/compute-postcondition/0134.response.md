The code `top = i` updates the value of `top` to be equal to `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `top` is now 1.

- The value of `i` remains unchanged, which is 1.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `j`.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `m`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `n`.
- The value of `screen` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `screen`.
- The value of `top` is now 1 because it was updated to `i`.
- The value of `bottom` remains 1 or `i` (which is 1) because the code does not affect `bottom`.
- The value of `left` is now `j + 1` because `j` was incremented by 1 and is still less than `m`.
- The value of `right` is now `j + 1` because `j` was incremented by 1 and is still less than or equal to `right`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1 or 1, `left` is `j + 1`, `right` is `j + 1`**.
