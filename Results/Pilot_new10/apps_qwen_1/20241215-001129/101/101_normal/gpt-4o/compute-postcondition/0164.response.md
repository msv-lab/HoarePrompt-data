Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, `j` is the next column index (`k + 1`), and `result[i][j]` is `'+'` if `result[i][j] == '.'`, otherwise `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.***
