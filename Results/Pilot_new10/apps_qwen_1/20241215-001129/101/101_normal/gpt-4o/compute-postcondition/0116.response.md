Postcondition: ***`total` is not mentioned and remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is the column index where 'w' is found, `j` satisfies the condition of being less than `m`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`.***

Explanation: Since the `if` condition `top is None` is true in the given context, the `if` part is executed, setting `top` to 1 and ensuring `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain as `top`, which is 1. There is no `else` part to consider, so the postcondition remains as described by the `if` part.
