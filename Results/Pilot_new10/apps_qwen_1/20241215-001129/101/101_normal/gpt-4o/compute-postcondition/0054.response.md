The code assigns the current value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Initially, `j` is set to `0`. Therefore, `left` and `right` are both assigned the value `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is `n - 1`, `bottom` is `n - 1`, `left` is `0`, `right` is `0`, `i` is now `n - 1`, `j` is now `0`, and `top` is `n - 1` since no 'w' was found in the screen initially.**
