The code snippet `result[i][j] = '+'` updates the value of `result[i][j]` to `'+'`. Given the conditions, `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `right + 1`. Since `i` is either `top` or `bottom`, and `j` is `right + 1`, this means we are updating the boundary elements of the `result` matrix.

The initial conditions state that `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`. This implies that the original values of `result` for these boundary positions are being updated to `'+'`. 

Therefore, the `result[i][j]` that was originally something other than `'+'` (since the boundary elements are already `'+'`) is now changed to `'+'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\); `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\); `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`; `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found; `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found; `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found; `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2; `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `right + 1`; if `result[i][j] == '.'`, it is changed to `'+'`; otherwise, the value of `result[i][j]` remains `'+'`.**
