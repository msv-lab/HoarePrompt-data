Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
   - `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w".
   - `top` is updated to `i` if `top` is `None` or `i` is less than `top`; otherwise, `top` remains unchanged.
   - `bottom` is updated to `i`.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `left` is updated to `j` if `j + 1 > right` or `j > right`, otherwise `left` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `right` is updated to `j` if `j > right`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.

3. **Conditions within the Loop**:
   - If `screen[i][j] == 'w'`, the conditions for `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are checked and updated accordingly.

4. **State After Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state after the previous iteration of the loop, which means we need to consider the value of `j` after the previous iteration.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 at the end of each iteration, the value of `j` after the previous iteration would be `j - 1`.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `left` and `right` will be updated based on the condition checks, but without specific values, we cannot definitively state their exact values.
   - `top` and `bottom` will be updated based on the condition checks, but without specific values, we cannot definitively state their exact values.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w".
- `top` is updated to `i` if `top` is `None` or `i` is less than `top`; otherwise, `top` remains unchanged.
- `bottom` is updated to `i`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `left` is updated to `j - 1` if `(j - 1) + 1 > right` or `(j - 1) > right`, otherwise `left` remains unchanged.
- `j` is incremented by 1 (so it becomes `j` for the next iteration).
- `right` is updated to `j - 1` if `(j - 1) > right`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is updated to `i` if `top` is `None` or `i` is less than `top`; otherwise, `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is updated to `i`, `i` remains unchanged, `left` is updated to `j - 1` if `(j - 1) + 1 > right` or `(j - 1) > right`, otherwise `left` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `right` is updated to `j - 1` if `(j - 1) > right`**.
