The code snippet changes the value of `result[i][j]` to `'+'` for the rows and columns that satisfy the conditions \(i == top\) or \(i == bottom\) or \(j == left\) or \((j == right)\). This means that the boundary of the frame in `screen` is marked with `'+'` instead of `'.'`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either `"."` or `"w"`
- `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found
- `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found
- `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found
- `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
- `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`

After executing the code snippet, the boundary of the frame in `screen` is updated. The `result` variable is not defined initially, but it is implied to be a copy or equivalent structure of `screen` where the boundaries are marked with `'+'`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
- `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`
- `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found
- `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found
- `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found
- `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
- `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\); `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\); `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`; `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found; `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found; `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found; `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2; `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`; `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.**
