Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the smallest possible square frame around the white pixels. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum frame size and updating the pixels is flawed.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

### Example:
**Input:**
```
3 3
.w.
...
.w.
```

**Expected Output:**
```
+++ 
+++
+++ 
```

**Actual Output:**
```
.w.
...
.w.
```

### Issue:
The program fails to recognize that the smallest possible frame that encompasses all the white pixels is a 3x3 square with all edges filled with '+' characters. Instead, it leaves the white pixels unchanged and does not update them to represent the frame.

The program needs to ensure that all white pixels are on the frame and that the frame is of the smallest possible size. Currently, the program does not properly update the pixels to form the smallest possible frame.
