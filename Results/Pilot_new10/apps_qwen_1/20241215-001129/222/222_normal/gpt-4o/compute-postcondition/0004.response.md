`i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Since `k` is an integer such that `0 <= k <= 1000`, `2 * k + 1` is an odd number between 1 and 2001. The exact value of `i` depends on the value of `k`. The other variables (`n`, `positions`, and `i`) are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is `[1]`, `i` is 2 + 2 * k + 1**
