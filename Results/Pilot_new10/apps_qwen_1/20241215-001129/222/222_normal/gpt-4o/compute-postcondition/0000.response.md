The given code initializes an empty list called `positions`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `k`. Therefore, the only change is that the `positions` list is now empty.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is an empty list**
