The code `positions.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `positions`. Given the initial state where `positions` is `[1]` and `i` is `2 + 2 * k + 1`, after appending `i` to `positions`, the list `positions` becomes `[1, 2 + 2 * k + 1]`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2 + 2 * k + 1, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is [1, 2 + 2 * k + 1], `i` is 2 + 2 * k + 1**
