#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000.
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to the final value of `i`, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is a list containing all integers starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1` until the last value is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is the final value of `i` which is `2 + 2 * k * (number_of_iterations) + (number_of_iterations - 1)`
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 1000 inclusive. It generates a list of integers starting from 1 and increases each subsequent integer by `2 * k + 1`. After generating the list, it prints the length of the list followed by the list elements separated by spaces.
