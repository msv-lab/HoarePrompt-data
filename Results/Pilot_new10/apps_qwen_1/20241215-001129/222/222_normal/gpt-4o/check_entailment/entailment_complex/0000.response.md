Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires Miroslav to turn over all \( n \) skewers using the minimal number of actions, where each action involves flipping \( k \) skewers centered around a specific skewer.

2. **Current Implementation**: The current implementation of `func_1` generates a list of integers starting from 1 and increasing by \( 2k + 1 \). This list does not represent the optimal sequence of skewers to flip to achieve the desired state. Instead, it simply increments by \( 2k + 1 \), which doesn't consider the actual flipping logic required.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 2 \):
     - The generated list would be: `[1, 5]`.
     - This means only skewers 1 and 5 would be flipped.
     - However, according to the problem, the correct flips would be to flip skewers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in two steps: first flipping 1 and 6, then flipping 4 and 5.
   
   - For \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 1 \):
     - The generated list would be: `[1, 3, 5]`.
     - This means skewers 1, 3, and 5 would be flipped.
     - According to the problem, the correct flips would be to flip skewers 1 and 4.

The program does not generate the correct sequence of skewers to flip to ensure all \( n \) skewers are turned over. Instead, it generates a sequence that does not necessarily minimize the number of actions or achieve the desired state.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
