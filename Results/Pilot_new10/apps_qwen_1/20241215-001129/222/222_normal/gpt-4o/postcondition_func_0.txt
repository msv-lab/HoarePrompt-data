The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 1000 inclusive. It generates a list of integers starting from 1 and increases each subsequent integer by `2 * k + 1`. After generating the list, it prints the length of the list followed by the list elements separated by spaces.
