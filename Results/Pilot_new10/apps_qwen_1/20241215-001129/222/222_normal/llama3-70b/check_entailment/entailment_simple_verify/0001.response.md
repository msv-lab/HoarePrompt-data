Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code provides clear insight into how the program operates. While the original assessment was initially marked as **False**, the code does not fail in the way described. Specifically, the code correctly handles the scenario where `k` is 0. In this case, the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` simplifies to 1 when `k` is 0, and the resulting list `res` contains only the first skewer. This matches the expected behavior as per the problem description, where turning the first skewer changes its state without affecting others. Thus, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided input constraints.
