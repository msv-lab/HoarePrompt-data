Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final output state of the variables after the loop has finished executing.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\).
- `l` is calculated as \((n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)\).
- `res` is an empty list.

### Loop Code
```
for i in range(l):
    res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
```

### Analysis of the Loop
- The loop runs `l` times, where `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`.
- In each iteration, `res` gets appended with the value `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`.

### Determining the Final State
#### Case 1: Loop Executes at Least Once
- For the loop to execute at least once, \(l > 0\).
- Therefore, \(n + k - 1 \geq k * 2 + 1\) simplifies to \(n \geq k + 2\).
- If the loop executes at least once, `res` will contain the elements generated by the loop, starting from `1` up to `l * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`.

#### Case 2: Loop Does Not Execute
- If \(l = 0\), which means \(n < k + 2\).
- In this case, `res` remains an empty list.

### Output State
Based on the above analysis, we can summarize the final state of the variables after the loop has finished executing:

**Output State:**
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\).
- `l` is calculated as \((n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)\).
- `res` is a list containing integers of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(l-1\) if \(l > 0\). If \(l = 0\), `res` is an empty list.

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\), `l` is \((n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)\), `res` is a list of integers of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(l-1\) if \(l > 0\), otherwise `res` is an empty list.
