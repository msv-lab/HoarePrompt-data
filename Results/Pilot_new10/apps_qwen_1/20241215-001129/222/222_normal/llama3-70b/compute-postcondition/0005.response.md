According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are given:
- `n` is at least 3
- `k` is at least 1
- `l` is greater than 0
- `res` is a list containing at least one element which is `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`. Since `l` must remain the same for the loop to continue, `l` remains greater than 0.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `n` is at least 3
- `k` is at least 1
- `l` is greater than 0
- `res` is a list containing at least one element which is `(i + 1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`

State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is at least 1, `l` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing at least one element which is `(i + 1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1**
