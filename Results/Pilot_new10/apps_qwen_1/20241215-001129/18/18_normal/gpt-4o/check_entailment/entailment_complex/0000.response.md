Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the transitions between standing and sitting spectators accurately.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Standing Spectators:**
   - The program does not simulate the transition of standing and sitting spectators over time as described in the problem statement. It only checks if `t` falls within certain ranges and prints a fixed value without considering the actual state of each spectator.

2. **Output Values:**
   - For `t <= k`, the program prints `t`, which is correct as the first `k` spectators will be standing up to time `k`.
   - For `k < t <= n`, the program prints `k`, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, at times `k+1` to `n`, the first `k` spectators will sit down one by one while new spectators stand up. Therefore, the number of standing spectators should be `n - (t - k)` for `k < t <= n`.

3. **For `t > n + k`:**
   - The program prints `n + k - t`, which is also incorrect. As per the problem statement, once all spectators have sat down by time `n + k`, no more spectators will stand up, so the number of standing spectators should be `0`.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly simulate the Mexican wave, we need to consider the state of each spectator at time `t`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Calculate the position of the standing spectators
    standing_spectator_position = (t - 1) % (n - k + 1)
    standing_spectator_count = min(standing_spectator_position + 1, k)
    
    print(standing_spectator_count)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- We calculate the position of the standing spectator using `(t - 1) % (n - k + 1)`. This gives us the index of the spectator who is standing at time `t`.
- We then determine the number of standing spectators by taking the minimum of the standing spectator's position plus one and `k`, since the wave pattern repeats every `n - k + 1` units of time.

This implementation correctly simulates the Mexican wave and outputs the correct number of standing spectators at any given time `t`.
