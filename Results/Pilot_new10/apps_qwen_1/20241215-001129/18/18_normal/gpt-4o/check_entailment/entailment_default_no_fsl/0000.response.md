Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the condition `if t <= n:` should be `if t <= n + k:` to cover all possible values of `t`. The current implementation incorrectly handles cases where `t > n` but still within the range `[n+1, n+k-1]`.

For example, consider the input:
```
10 5 12
```

According to the problem description:
- At `t = 12`, the number of standing spectators should be 3, as the standing sequence is `- --- ^^^^` (spectator 11 stands, and spectators 2 through 5 sit).

However, the current code will incorrectly print `5` because it checks `t <= n` instead of `t <= n + k`:
```
At t = 12, the code will print: n + k - t = 10 + 5 - 12 = 3
```

This is a mistake since the correct logic should be:
```
if t <= k:
    print(t)
elif t <= n + k:
    print(k)
else:
    print(n + k - t)
```

To fix this, the condition `t <= n` should be changed to `t <= n + k`.
