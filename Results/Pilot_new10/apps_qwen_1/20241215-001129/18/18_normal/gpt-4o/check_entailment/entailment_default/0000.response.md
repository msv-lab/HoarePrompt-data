Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically:

- For `t` values between `k + 1` and `n`, the code always prints `k`, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the number of standing spectators should decrease linearly from `k` to 1 as `t` increases from `k + 1` to `n`.

For example, consider the input `10 5 7`:
- At `t = 7`, the number of standing spectators should be `5`, but the code incorrectly prints `5`.
- However, at `t = 8`, the number of standing spectators should be `4`, but the code again prints `5`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the code needs to correctly calculate the number of standing spectators based on the value of `t` within the range `[k+1, n]`. A correct implementation would be:

```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= k:
        print(t)
    elif t <= n:
        print(k + 1 - (t - k))
    else:
        print(0)
```

This corrected code calculates the number of standing spectators correctly for all potential cases.
