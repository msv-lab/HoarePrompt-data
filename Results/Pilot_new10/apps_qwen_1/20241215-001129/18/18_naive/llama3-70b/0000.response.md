Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of spectators standing at time `t`. Let's analyze a specific case to demonstrate this:

For the input:
```
10 5 12
```

According to the problem description:
- At time 12, the 12-th spectator stands and the (12 - 5)-th spectator (i.e., the 7-th spectator) sits.

Based on the description, we expect 5 spectators to be standing at time 12. However, the program calculates:
```
if t <= n:
    print(min(t, k))
else:
    print(k - (t - n) % k)
```

For `t = 12`, `t > n` is false, so it enters the else block:
```
print(k - (12 - 10) % 5)
```
This simplifies to:
```
print(5 - 2 % 5)
```
Which evaluates to:
```
print(5 - 2)
```
Thus, the output is:
```
3
```

This is incorrect because at time 12, the expected number of standing spectators is 5, not 3. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the described behavior for all potential cases.
