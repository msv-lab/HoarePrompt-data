Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when `t` is greater than `n`. According to the problem description, at time `t = n + 1`, the `(n + 1 - k)`-th spectator starts sitting, and this pattern continues until all spectators have sat down. However, the program only considers the cases when `t <= k` and `t <= n`, but it does not account for the scenario when `t > n`.

For example, consider the input `10 5 16`:
- According to the description, at `t = 16`, the 11th spectator (which is out of bounds since there are only 10 spectators) would be sitting, and the 6th spectator would have already sat down. Therefore, the number of standing spectators should be 4.
- However, the program will output `10 + 5 - 16 = -1`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case when `t > n` by determining how many spectators are still standing after time `n`. This can be done by calculating the remaining time after `n` and applying the pattern described for `t > n`.
