Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` only checks if the total sum of the digits is even and if it can be split into segments with a sum equal to half of the total sum. This approach is insufficient to determine if the ticket can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. The annotated version highlights that the program does not check all possible ways to split the ticket into segments, which is required to correctly determine if the ticket is lucky. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
