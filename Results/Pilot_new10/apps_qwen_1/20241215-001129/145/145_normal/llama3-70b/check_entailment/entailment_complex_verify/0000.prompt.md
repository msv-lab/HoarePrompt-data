You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
    return segments >= 2


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it determines if the ticket is lucky. The program only checks if the total sum of the digits is even and attempts to split the ticket into segments with equal sums by checking if the current sum equals half of the total sum. However, this approach does not guarantee that the ticket can be divided into multiple non-intersecting segments with equal sums.

For example, consider the input `73452`. The program would correctly identify that the total sum is 19, which is odd, so it returns `False` immediately, which is correct.

However, consider the input `12363`. The total sum is 16, which is even. The program would then check if the current sum can reach half of the total sum (which is 8). Here, the program would find a segment `12` (sum 3) and `363` (sum 12), but it fails to correctly identify that the ticket can actually be divided into segments `1`, `23`, and `63` (sum 1, 5, 9 respectively), which do not meet the requirement of having equal sums.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to explore different ways to split the ticket into segments and ensure that each segment has the same sum. A more complex algorithm, such as dynamic programming or backtracking, would be required to accurately determine if the ticket is lucky.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string consisting of $n$ digits where $2 \le n \le 100$ and each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if (total_sum % 2 != 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `ticket` is a string consisting of $n$ digits where $2 \le n \le 100$ and each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`. The total sum of the digits in `ticket` is even
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ticket` is a string consisting of \( n \) digits where \( 2 \le n \le 100 \), `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is the number of segments found such that the sum of digits in each segment equals `target_sum`.
    return segments >= 2
    #The program returns True if there are at least 2 segments in `ticket` where the sum of the digits in each segment equals `target_sum`, otherwise False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `ticket` consisting of \( n \) digits where \( 2 \le n \le 100 \) and each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive. It calculates the total sum of the digits in `ticket` and checks if this sum is even. If the sum is not even, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it calculates half of the total sum (`target_sum`) and iterates through the digits in `ticket`, counting the number of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`. If there are at least two such segments, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
