The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `ticket`. `ticket` is a string consisting of $n$ digits where $2 \le n \le 100$ and each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.

Case_1: The program returns `False`.

Case_2: The program returns `True` if there are at least 2 segments in `ticket` where the sum of the digits in each segment equals `target_sum`, otherwise `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `ticket` and return `False` unless there are at least 2 segments in `ticket` where the sum of the digits in each segment equals `target_sum`, in which case it returns `True`.
