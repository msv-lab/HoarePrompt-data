`curr_sum` is incremented by `digit`. However, since the initial value of `curr_sum` and `digit` are not specified, the updated value of `curr_sum` will be the original value of `curr_sum` plus the value of `digit`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_sum` is the original value of `curr_sum` plus `digit`, `digit` is unchanged**
