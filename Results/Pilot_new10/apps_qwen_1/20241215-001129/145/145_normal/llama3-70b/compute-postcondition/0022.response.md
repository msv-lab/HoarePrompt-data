Postcondition: ***`curr_sum` is the original value of `curr_sum` plus the value of `digit`, `digit` is the next digit in `ticket`, and `segments` remains unchanged. If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `digit` is removed from `ticket`, `segments` is incremented by 1, and `curr_sum` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the values of `curr_sum`, `digit`, and `segments` remain as they were before the if-else block.***
