`segments` is incremented by 1. The values of `curr_sum` and `digit` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `curr_sum` is the original value of `curr_sum` plus the value of `digit`, `digit` is the next digit in `ticket`, `segments` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`curr_sum` is the original value of `curr_sum` plus the value of `digit`, `digit` is the next digit in `ticket`, `segments` is incremented by 1**
