You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the ticket cannot be divided into segments with equal sums. Specifically, the program assumes that the target segment length will always exist in the ticket and fails to check if such a division is possible. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
12345
```

In this case, no combination of non-intersecting segments can have equal sums. However, the program will incorrectly return "YES" because it does not properly check all possible segmentations. The program should ensure that the total sum of the ticket can be evenly divided by the number of segments before attempting to find those segments.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and ticket is a string consisting of n digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: ``current_sum` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length - 1` digits of `ticket` for the last valid segment, and `segment_count` is the count of valid segments if `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is greater than 1, otherwise `current_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, `segment_count` is 0.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)) and a string `ticket` consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive. It checks if the string `ticket` can be partitioned into segments where each segment has the same sum. If such a partition exists, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string consisting of n digits (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each digit is between '0' and '9'), start and end are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ start ≤ end < len(ticket).
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits in the string 'ticket' from index 'start' to index 'end' inclusive
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq \text{start} \leq \text{end} < \text{len(ticket)}\). It returns the sum of the digits in the string `ticket` from index `start` to index `end` inclusive. This includes handling the case where the indices are valid within the length of the string `ticket`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
