The initial value of `current_sum` is set to 0, which means it is being reassigned. This reassignment does not depend on any other variables and simply sets `current_sum` to 0.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0**
