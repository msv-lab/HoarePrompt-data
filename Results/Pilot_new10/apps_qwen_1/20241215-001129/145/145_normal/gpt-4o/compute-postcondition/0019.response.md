Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and n > 3, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, `current_sum` is the integer value of the 5th digit in `ticket`, `segment_count` is 1. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `total` is increased by the value of the 5th digit in `ticket` and `segment_count` becomes 2. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.**
