`segment_count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_sum` is 0, `i` is 4, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`, `segment_count` is 3, and `segment_length` is `n`.
