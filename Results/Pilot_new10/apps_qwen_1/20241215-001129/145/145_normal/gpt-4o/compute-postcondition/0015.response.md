Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
   - `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive
   - `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`
   - `current_sum` is 0
   - `segment_count` is 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `n`, and given that `i` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.
   - At the end of the current iteration, `i` will increment by 1, so `i` will become 4.
   - The values of `total`, `n`, `ticket`, `target_sum`, and `current_sum` do not change if `current_sum` does not equal `target_sum` and `segment_count` is incremented only when `current_sum` equals `target_sum`.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` increases by 1, so it becomes 4.
- `n` must still be within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and must be greater than 3.

So, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and n > 3, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1**.
