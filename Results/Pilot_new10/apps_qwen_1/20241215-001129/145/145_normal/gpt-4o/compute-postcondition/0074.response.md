The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive. Based on the given cases, the function returns 'YES' in three different scenarios and 'NO' in one scenario. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `ticket`, and return 'YES' under certain conditions and 'NO' otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `ticket` (a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive), and returns 'YES' in three cases and 'NO' in one case.**
