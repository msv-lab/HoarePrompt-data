`segment_count` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, and `target_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`. The value of `segment_count` is now 1 more than its previous value.

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`, `segment_count` is 1**
