Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly verify if the ticket can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. The logic in `func_1` only checks if the total sum of the ticket is even and if it can be split into segments with a sum equal to half of the total sum. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the ticket is lucky. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
123456
```

The total sum is 21, which is odd, so the function will immediately return `False`. However, the ticket can actually be divided into segments `12` and `3456`, which both sum to 14. This case is not handled correctly by the current implementation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to check all possible ways to split the ticket into segments and ensure that at least one valid split exists where all segments have the same sum.
