Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem but has a logical flaw. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks for segments of the same length (`segment_length`), which is insufficient. It fails to consider different possible segment lengths that could sum to the same value. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
123321
```

The correct answer should be "YES" because the ticket can be divided into segments `1`, `23`, and `321` such that `1 = 2 + 3 = 3 + 2 + 1`. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly. It only checks for segments of the same length and misses this valid division. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
