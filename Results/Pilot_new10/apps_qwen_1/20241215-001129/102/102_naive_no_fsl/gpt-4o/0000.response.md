Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program only checks for solutions where `x` (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) is within the range `[0, n // a]`. However, this approach may miss valid solutions where `y` (the number of Bars bars) could be zero and `x` could be larger than `n // a`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
15
4
8
```

In this case, the program will not find a solution because it only checks up to `x = 3` (since `n // a = 15 // 4 = 3`). However, the correct solution would be `x = 0` and `y = 1`, which satisfies `0 * 4 + 1 * 8 = 8`, but the program will output `NO` because it did not check beyond `x = 3`.

To fix this, the program should iterate over all possible values of `y` and check if the remaining amount can be exactly matched by `x * a`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    found = False
    
    for y in range(n // b + 1):
        if (n - y * b) % a == 0:
            x = (n - y * b) // a
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            found = True
            break
    
    if not found:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible values of `y` and checks if the remaining amount can be exactly matched by `x * a`, ensuring that all potential solutions are considered.
