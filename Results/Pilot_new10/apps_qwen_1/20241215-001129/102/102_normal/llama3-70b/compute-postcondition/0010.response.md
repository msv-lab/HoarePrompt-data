Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is `n // b`.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`.
   - `a` is an integer input from the user.
   - The condition `x * a + y * b == n` determines the output as 'YES' if true.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The for loop runs over the range `range(n // a + 1)`. This means the loop will run from `x = 0` to `x = n // a`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0, and `y` is `n // b`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `x` will become 1.
   - The value of `y` does not change within this loop iteration based on the given information.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `x` changes to 1.
   - `y` remains `n // b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`x` is 1, `y` is `n // b`, `n` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, `a` is an integer input from the user**.
