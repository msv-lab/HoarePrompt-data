Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code uses a brute-force approach to check for possible values of `x` and `y` within the range `0` to `n // a` and `0` to `n // b`, respectively. However, this approach is incomplete because it does not ensure that the values of `x` and `y` satisfy the equation `x * a + y * b = n` for all possible combinations.

For instance, consider the case where `n = 9960594`, `a = 2551`, and `b = 2557`. The provided solution finds a valid pair `(x, y)` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or similar method, but the current implementation might miss this solution due to the limited range of `x` and `y`.

To ensure correctness, the program should use a more robust method, such as checking for the existence of a solution using the properties of linear Diophantine equations. A correct implementation would involve checking if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` divides `n`, and if so, finding a particular solution and then generating all solutions.

Here is an example of how the program could be corrected:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())

    # Calculate the GCD of a and b
    gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)

    # Check if n is divisible by the GCD of a and b
    if n % gcd_ab != 0:
        print('NO')
        return

    # Find a particular solution
    x0, y0 = divmod(n, a)

    # Adjust x0 and y0 to find a non-negative solution
    while y0 >= b:
        y0 -= b
        x0 += 1
    while x0 >= a:
        x0 -= a
        y0 += 1

    # Ensure both x0 and y0 are non-negative
    if x0 < 0 or y0 < 0:
        print('NO')
        return

    print('YES')
    print(x0, y0)


func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the solution is found for all valid cases and handles edge cases appropriately.
