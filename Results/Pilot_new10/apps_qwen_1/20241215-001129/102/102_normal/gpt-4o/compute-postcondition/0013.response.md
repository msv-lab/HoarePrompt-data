The print statement outputs the values of `x` and `y`. However, the values of `x` and `y` are not directly updated or calculated within this statement; they are defined in the initial state. The only action taken by the print statement is to output these values. Therefore, the values of `a`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the expressions for `x` and `y` are still valid as per the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `n` must be such that `n // a` is at least 1, and the expression `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) % b != 0` holds true; `y` is calculated as `(n - x * a) // b`, and 'YES' is printed to the console, `x` and `y` are printed.**
