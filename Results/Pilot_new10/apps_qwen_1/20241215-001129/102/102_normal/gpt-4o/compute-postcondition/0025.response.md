Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input, where `n` represents the amount of money Vasya has, `a` is the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and `b` is the cost of one Bars bar. It then attempts to find non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b = n`. If such integers exist, it prints 'YES' followed by the values of `x` and `y`, and returns immediately. If no such integers exist, it prints 'NO' and returns nothing.**
