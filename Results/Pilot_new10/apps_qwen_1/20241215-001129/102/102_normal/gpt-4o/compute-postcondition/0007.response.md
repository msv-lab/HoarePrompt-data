The code `print(x, y)` simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `n` must be such that `n // a` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `b` is a divisor of `(n - x * a)`, `y` is an integer equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, and `(n - x * a) % b == 0`; prints 'YES', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer equal to `(n - x * a) // b`**
