`y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. Given the initial condition that `(n - x * a) % b == 0`, it means that `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`, so the division operation will result in an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `n` must be such that `n // a` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `b` is a divisor of `(n - x * a)`, `y` is an integer equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, and `(n - x * a) % b == 0`**
