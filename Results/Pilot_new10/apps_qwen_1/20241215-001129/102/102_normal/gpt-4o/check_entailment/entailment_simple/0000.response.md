Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) from the input as specified.
2. **Loop Execution**: It iterates over all possible values of \( x \) from 0 to \( \frac{n}{a} \). For each value of \( x \), it checks if there exists a non-negative integer \( y \) such that \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n \).
3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, it calculates \( y \) using the equation \( y = \frac{n - x \cdot a}{b} \) and checks if \( y \) is an integer (i.e., \( (n - x \cdot a) \% b == 0 \)).
4. **Output**: If such \( x \) and \( y \) are found, it prints "YES" followed by the values of \( x \) and \( y \) and returns, indicating that it's possible to spend exactly \( n \) burles.
5. **No Solution**: If no such \( x \) and \( y \) are found after the loop completes, it prints "NO", indicating that it's not possible to spend exactly \( n \) burles.

### Why it always meets the problem description:

- **Comprehensive Search**: The program searches through all possible combinations of \( x \) and \( y \) in a systematic manner, ensuring that all possibilities are considered.
- **Correct Conditions**: The condition \( (n - x \cdot a) \% b == 0 \) correctly checks whether the remaining amount can be exactly divided by \( b \), ensuring that \( y \) is an integer.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases properly, including when \( x \) or \( y \) might be zero.
- **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem statement, printing "YES" and the values of \( x \) and \( y \) if a solution is found, and "NO" otherwise.

Given this analysis, the program always adheres to the requirements of the problem description and thus is correct.
