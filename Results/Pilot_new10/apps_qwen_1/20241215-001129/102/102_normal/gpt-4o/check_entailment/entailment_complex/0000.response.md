Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input, ensuring they meet the constraints \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10,000,000\).

2. **Loop to Find Solution**: 
   - The program iterates over all possible values of `x` from 0 to \(n // a\).
   - For each value of `x`, it checks if there exists an integer `y` such that \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\). This is done using the condition `(n - x * a) % b == 0`.
   - If such a `y` exists, the program prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y` and then returns, effectively terminating the search early once a valid solution is found.

3. **Output Handling**: 
   - If no valid pair `(x, y)` is found after the loop, the program prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where no solution exists (e.g., Input: `15` with `a = 4` and `b = 8`).
   - It also correctly finds solutions when multiple pairs `(x, y)` satisfy the equation (e.g., Input: `100` with `a = 25` and `b = 10`).

5. **Return Values**:
   - The program prints "YES" and outputs valid values of `x` and `y` when a solution is found.
   - It prints "NO" when no solution is found, adhering to the requirement to output "NO" in such cases.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required functionality and meets the problem description in all scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.
