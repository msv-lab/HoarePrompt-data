Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for deletions of substrings with multiple consecutive identical characters. For example, consider the input "aaa":

- The program would output `1` because it counts each different character as a separate operation, but the correct answer should be `1` since we can delete all 'a's in one operation.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
3
aaa
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

Although the output is correct in this specific case, the program does not correctly handle the general case where deletions can involve more than one character at a time. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
