Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The code counts the number of operations based on the number of transitions between different characters in the string, which does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string.

For example, consider the string "aaabbb". According to the code, it would take 2 operations because there are two transitions ('a' to 'b' and 'b' to 'b'). However, the correct minimum number of operations is 1, as you can delete the substring "aaa" in one operation, followed by deleting "bbb".

Similarly, for the string "aaaa", the code would return 3 operations, but the correct answer is 1, as you can delete the entire string in one operation.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
