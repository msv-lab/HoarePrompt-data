The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is expected to be an integer between 1 and 500) to the variable `n`. The value of `s` remains unchanged because the input statement does not affect `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters**
