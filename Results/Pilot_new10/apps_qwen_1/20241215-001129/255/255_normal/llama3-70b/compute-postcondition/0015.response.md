The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. The parameter constraints and relationships imply that there should be two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters). However, since these parameters are not included in the function definition provided, we will assume they are part of the context or are meant to be understood from the problem statement.

Given the output cases, the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet. Therefore, we need to infer the return value based on the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `s` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500 and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and returns either nothing (void) or a specific value based on the provided cases.**
