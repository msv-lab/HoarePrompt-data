The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans` to the console. It does not change the value of `ans` or any other variables. The states of `s`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is the string input by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `ans` is the count of positions where consecutive characters in the string `s` are different**
