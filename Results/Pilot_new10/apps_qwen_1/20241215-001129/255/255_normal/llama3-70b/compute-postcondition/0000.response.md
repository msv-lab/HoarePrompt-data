The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (as an integer) to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`, the only change here is that `n` is now set to the integer value entered by the user within this range.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the integer value entered by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 500**
