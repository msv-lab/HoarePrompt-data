Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Problem Requirement**: The problem requires calculating the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string by deleting contiguous substrings of equal characters. However, the current implementation only counts the number of positions where consecutive characters in the string are different.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 1.
   - It iterates through the string starting from index 1.
   - If the current character (`s[i]`) is different from the previous character (`s[i-1]`), `ans` is incremented.

This logic fails to account for the actual operations required to delete all substrings of equal characters. Consider the following example:

- **Input**: `s = "aaabbbccc"`
- **Expected Output**: 3 (Delete "aaa", then "bbb", then "ccc")
- **Actual Output with Given Code**: 2 (It increments `ans` at each change in character, which would incorrectly give 2).

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to use a more sophisticated approach, such as a stack-based solution or dynamic programming, to keep track of the minimum deletions required for contiguous equal characters. The current logic only counts the transitions between different characters and does not simulate the actual deletions of equal contiguous substrings.
