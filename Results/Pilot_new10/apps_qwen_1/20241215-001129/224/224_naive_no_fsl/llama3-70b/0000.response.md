Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` calculates `f_max(n)` incorrectly. It should calculate the maximum value of `f(p)` for all permutations of length `n`, but instead, it calculates the GCD of the numbers from 1 to `n` repeatedly, which is not equivalent to `f_max(n)`.

To verify this, consider the case when `n = 6`. The correct `f_max(6)` should be 3, because the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` results in `f(p) = 3` (the GCDs are 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1), and no other permutation can achieve a higher value. However, the program outputs 120, which is the number of permutations that achieve `f(p) = 3`.

This discrepancy indicates that the program is incorrect, and thus, the output is `False`.
