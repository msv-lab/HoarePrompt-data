Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the program only handles the case when \( n = 2 \) correctly and uses a simple factorial calculation for other values of \( n \), which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

The problem requires counting the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \). For \( n \geq 3 \), the maximum value of \( f(p) \) is \( \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil \). However, the provided program calculates the factorial of \( n-1 \) for \( n > 2 \), which is not related to the correct solution.

For example, consider \( n = 3 \):

- The maximum value of \( f(p) \) is 2.
- There are 4 permutations of length 3: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
- Out of these, the permutations [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1] have \( f(p) = 2 \).

The correct output for \( n = 3 \) should be 4, but the program outputs the factorial of 2, which is 2, indicating that the program is incorrect for this and other values of \( n \).
