    while b:

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'a' is the GCD of the original values of 'a' and 'b', 'b' is 0
    return a
    #The program returns 'a', which is the GCD of the original values of 'a' and 'b', and 'b' is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to 0. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the function, the function returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and sets `b` to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)) and returns the maximum value obtained by applying `func_1(res, i)` for all integers `i` from 1 to `n`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and f_max_n is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (j + 1) * dp[j - 1] % 10`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `dp[j]` is the final value of `dp[f_max_n]` after the loop completes.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns dp[f_max_n], which is calculated as (f_max_n + 1) * dp[f_max_n - 1] % 10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `n` and `f_max_n`. It computes and returns `dp[f_max_n]` using a dynamic programming approach, where `dp[j]` is updated to represent the cumulative product of `(j + 1)` for all `j` from 0 to `f_max_n`, modulo `10^9 + 7`. The function handles the case where `f_max_n` is 0 by initializing `dp[0]` to 1 and leaves `n` as an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
