The function accepts two parameters `n` and `f_max_n`. It computes and returns `dp[f_max_n]` using a dynamic programming approach, where `dp[j]` is updated to represent the cumulative product of `(j + 1)` for all `j` from 0 to `f_max_n`, modulo `10^9 + 7`. The function handles the case where `f_max_n` is 0 by initializing `dp[0]` to 1 and leaves `n` as an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
