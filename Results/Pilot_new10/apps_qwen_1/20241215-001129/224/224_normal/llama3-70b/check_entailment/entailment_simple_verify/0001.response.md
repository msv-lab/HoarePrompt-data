Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that `func_2` is incorrectly calculating `f_max(n)` as the GCD of numbers from 1 to `n`, rather than the maximum value of `f(p)` for all permutations of length `n`. This leads to incorrect results, as demonstrated in the example where `f_max(6)` should be 3 but the program outputs 120. Therefore, the program's logic for determining `f_max(n)` is flawed, making the overall implementation incorrect.
