Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The `func_2` function indeed calculates the GCD of the sequence from 1 to n, but as explained, this does not correctly determine `f_max_n` according to the problem statement. The problem requires finding the maximum number of distinct GCD values among all permutations of length n, not just the GCD of the sequence from 1 to n. The annotated code confirms that `func_2` does not correctly compute `f_max_n` as intended, leading to an incorrect solution. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.
