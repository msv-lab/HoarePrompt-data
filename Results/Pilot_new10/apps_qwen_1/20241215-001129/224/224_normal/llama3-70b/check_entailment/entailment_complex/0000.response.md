Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
- The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
- Function `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- Function `func_2` correctly calculates `f_max_n`, which is the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`.
- Function `func_3` uses dynamic programming to count the number of permutations `p` such that `f(p)` equals `f_max_n`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- The overall logic of the program matches the problem description, and there are no apparent edge cases or examples where the program fails to meet the requirements.

The code and the provided annotations accurately reflect the problem description and handle all necessary cases, ensuring the program works correctly for every potential input within the specified range.
