The code updates `dp[j]` by applying the modulus operation with `MOD`, which is 10. Given the initial state, `dp[j]` is initially calculated as `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`. After the code execution, `dp[j]` is updated to its value modulo 10.

Since `dp[j]` was already computed as a value modulo 10, `dp[j] %= MOD` does not change its value because it is already within the range of 0 to 9. Therefore, the value of `dp[j]` remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `f_{\text{max}_n}` is a positive integer; `MOD` is 10; `dp` is a list of length `f_{\text{max}_n} + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_{\text{max}_n}`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`; `i = n + 1`; `j = f_{\text{max}_n} - 2`; `dp[j]` remains unchanged.**
