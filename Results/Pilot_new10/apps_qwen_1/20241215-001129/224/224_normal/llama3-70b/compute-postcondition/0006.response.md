The code snippet updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder when divided by `MOD`. Given that `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, the value of `dp[j]` (which is `dp[f_max_n]`) is updated to `dp[f_max_n] % MOD`.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length \(n\)
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0
- `dp[0] = 1`
- `j` is `f_max_n`

After executing the line `dp[j] %= MOD`, the value of `dp[f_max_n]` is updated to its remainder when divided by `MOD`. Since `MOD` is 10, `dp[f_max_n]` is now `dp[f_max_n] % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length \(n\), `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0, `dp[0] = 1`, `j` is `f_max_n`, `dp[f_max_n]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n] % 10`**
