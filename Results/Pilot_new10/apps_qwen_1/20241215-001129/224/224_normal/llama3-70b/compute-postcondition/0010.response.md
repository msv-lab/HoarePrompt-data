According to the code, the loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to 1. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n`
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0 with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[f_max_n] = dp[f_max_n] % 10`
- `j` is `f_max_n - 1`
- `dp[j]` is `(dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 1]) % 10`

The loop decrements `j` by 1 each time it runs. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `f_max_n - 2`.

Let's adjust the states step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
   - `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n`
   - `MOD` is 10
   - `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0 with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[f_max_n] = dp[f_max_n] % 10`
   - `j` is `f_max_n - 1`
   - `dp[j]` is `(dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 1]) % 10`

2. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` is decremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `f_max_n - 2`.
   - The value of `dp[j]` will depend on the values of `dp[f_max_n - 3]` and `dp[f_max_n - 2]` from the previous state.

Thus, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n`, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0 with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[f_max_n] = dp[f_max_n] % 10`, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[f_max_n - 3] + dp[f_max_n - 2]) % 10`**
