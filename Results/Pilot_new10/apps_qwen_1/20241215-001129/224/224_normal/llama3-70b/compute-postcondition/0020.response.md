The code updates `dp[j]` to be its value modulo `10`. Given the initial conditions, `dp[j]` is calculated as \( \text{dp}[j] + \text{dp}[j - 1] \). Since the initial value of `dp[j]` was already computed according to the given formula and now it is updated to its value modulo `10`, the new value of `dp[j]` will be the result of the previous computation taken modulo `10`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^6 \); \( f_{\text{max}_n} \) is a positive integer; \( \text{MOD} = 10 \); \( \text{dp} \) is a list of length \( f_{\text{max}_n} + 1 \) where \( \text{dp}[0] = 1 \) and for every \( j \) from 1 to \( f_{\text{max}_n} \), \( \text{dp}[j] = (2 \times \text{dp}[j - 1] + \text{dp}[j - 2] + \ldots + \text{dp}[0]) \% 10 \); \( i = n + 1 \); \( j = f_{\text{max}_n} - 1 \); and \( \text{dp}[j] \) is updated to \( (\text{dp}[j] + \text{dp}[j - 1]) \% 10 \).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^6 \); \( f_{\text{max}_n} \) is a positive integer; \( \text{MOD} = 10 \); \( \text{dp} \) is a list of length \( f_{\text{max}_n} + 1 \) where \( \text{dp}[0] = 1 \) and for every \( j \) from 1 to \( f_{\text{max}_n} \), \( \text{dp}[j] = (2 \times \text{dp}[j - 1] + \text{dp}[j - 2] + \ldots + \text{dp}[0]) \% 10 \); \( i = n + 1 \); \( j = f_{\text{max}_n} - 1 \); \( \text{dp}[j] \) is updated to \( (\text{dp}[j] + \text{dp}[j - 1]) \% 10 \)**.
