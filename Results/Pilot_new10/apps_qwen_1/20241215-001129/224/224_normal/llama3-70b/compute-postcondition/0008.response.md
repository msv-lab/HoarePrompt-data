`dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]`. Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1]`. The initial value of `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0, with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[f_max_n]` updated to `dp[f_max_n] % 10`. The code modifies `dp[f_max_n - 1]` to be the sum of `dp[f_max_n - 2]` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n`, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0 with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[f_max_n] = dp[f_max_n] % 10`, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`**.
