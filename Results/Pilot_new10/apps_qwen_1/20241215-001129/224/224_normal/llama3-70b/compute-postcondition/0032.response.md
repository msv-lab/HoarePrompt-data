Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `MOD` is 10
   - `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where:
     - `dp[0] = 1`
     - `dp[1] = 4`
     - For every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`
   - `i` is `n + 2`
   - `j` is 0
   - `dp[j]` is 5

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs in reverse order from `f_max_n` to 1.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, meaning the loop has already executed from `f_max_n` down to 1.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop has already completed its iterations from `f_max_n` down to 1, there are no more values of `j` left to process within the loop.
   - Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further because the loop cannot execute again.

5. **Final State:**
   - All the initial states remain unchanged since the loop has completed all its iterations.

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 4`, and for every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is 0, `dp[j]` is 5**.
