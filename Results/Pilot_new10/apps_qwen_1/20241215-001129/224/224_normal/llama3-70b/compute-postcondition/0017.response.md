The code `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` by taking the modulus with `MOD`, which is 10. Given the initial conditions:

- `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`
- `MOD` is 10

Since `dp[j]` is already computed and stored as `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`, applying the modulus operation again will not change its value because the value is already within the range of 0 to 9 (inclusive).

Therefore, `dp[j]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`**
