The code snippet updates `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. Initially, `dp[j]` is calculated as `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`. After the update, `dp[j]` becomes `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0] + dp[j - 1]) % 10`, which simplifies to `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.

Given that `dp[j]` is updated, the other variables remain unchanged in their respective conditions. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `f_max_n`**
