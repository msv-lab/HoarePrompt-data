The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `result`. No other changes are made to any variables. Therefore, the value of `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), and the value of `mod` remains `1000000007`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and mod is 1000000007; `result` is 1**
