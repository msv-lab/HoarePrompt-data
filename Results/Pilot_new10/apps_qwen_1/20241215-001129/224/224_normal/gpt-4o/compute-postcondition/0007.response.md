Output State: **`total` is 1, `mod` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `result` is the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`, `i` is `n` + 1**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
   - `mod` is 1000000007.
   - `result` is 1.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n + 1`.
   - On each iteration, `result` is updated as `result = result * i % mod`.

3. **Output State After Loop Executes Some Number of Times:**
   - After 1 iteration (`i = 2`): `result` becomes `2` (since `1 * 2 % 1000000007 = 2`).
   - After 2 iterations (`i = 3`): `result` becomes `6` (since `2 * 3 % 1000000007 = 6`).
   - After 3 iterations (`i = 4`): `result` becomes `24` (since `6 * 4 % 1000000007 = 24`).

4. **General Case Analysis:**
   - After \(k\) iterations, `i` will be \(k + 1\).
   - The final value of `result` after \(n - 1\) iterations (since the loop runs from 2 to \(n\)) will be the product of all integers from 2 to \(n\), modulo `mod`.
   - This is equivalent to the factorial of \(n\) modulo `mod`, i.e., `result` is \(2 \times 3 \times \cdots \times n \mod 1000000007\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - When the loop finishes executing all its iterations (from `i = 2` to `i = n`), `result` will be the factorial of `n` modulo `1000000007`.
   - The variable `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n + 1`.
   - The variables `total` and `mod` remain unchanged from their initial values.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:
**`total` is 1, `mod` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `result` is the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`, `i` is `n` + 1.**
