The code prints `0`, but this does not affect the values of the variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. The condition that `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is an input integer, `cnt4` is an input integer, and cnt3 > cnt1**
