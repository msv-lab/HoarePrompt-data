The code reads four integers from input, corresponding to the counts of strings "(((", "()", "())", and "))" respectively, and assigns them to the variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. After executing this code, the values of `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` are updated to the integers provided by the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is an input integer, `cnt4` is an input integer**
