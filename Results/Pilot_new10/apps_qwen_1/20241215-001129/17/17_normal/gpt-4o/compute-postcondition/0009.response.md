The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes an input consisting of four lines, where each line contains one integer representing the number of strings of a specific type ("((") for 1 <= i <= 4 (")("), and each integer satisfies 0 <= cnt_i <= 10^9. 

Based on the input, the function will produce some output, but since the output itself is not specified in the problem statement, we will focus on the input processing.

Functionality: **The function processes an input consisting of four lines, where each line contains one integer representing the number of strings of the type "((", and returns some unspecified output based on this input.**
