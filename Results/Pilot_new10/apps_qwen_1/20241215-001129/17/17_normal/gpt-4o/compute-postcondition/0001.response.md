`cnt2` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `cnt2` is now an integer input from the second line. The values of `cnt1`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`cnt1` is an integer input from the first line, 0 <= `cnt1` <= 10^9, `cnt2` is an integer input from the second line, `cnt3` is 0, `cnt4` is 0**
