`cnt4` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The previous values of `cnt1` and `cnt2` remain unchanged, and `cnt3` is also unchanged. The output state is: `cnt1` is an integer input from the first line, 0 <= `cnt1` <= 10^9, `cnt2` is an integer input from the second line, `cnt3` is an input integer, `cnt4` is the integer input from the third line.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an integer input from the first line, 0 <= `cnt1` <= 10^9, `cnt2` is an integer input from the second line, `cnt3` is an input integer, `cnt4` is the integer input from the third line**
