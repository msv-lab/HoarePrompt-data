The code `print(1)` does not affect any of the variables. It simply prints the number 1 to the console. The values of `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an integer with 0 <= `cnt1` <= 10^9, `cnt2` is an integer with `cnt2` >= `cnt3`, `cnt3` is an integer, `cnt4` is the integer input from the third line, and the sum of `cnt1` and `cnt2` equals the sum of `cnt3` and `cnt4`.**
