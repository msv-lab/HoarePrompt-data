`cnt1` is assigned the value of the first line input converted to an integer. The other variables (`cnt2`, `cnt3`, `cnt4`) remain unaffected. The precondition that `0 <= cnt1 <= 10^9` is still valid.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an integer input from the first line, 0 <= `cnt1` <= 10^9, `cnt2` is 0, `cnt3` is 0, `cnt4` is 0**
