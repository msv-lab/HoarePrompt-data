Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string. The dictionary `color_count` will either have the key `c` with its value incremented by 1 (if `c` was already present), or it will have the key `c` with the value 1 (if `c` was not previously in `color_count`).***
