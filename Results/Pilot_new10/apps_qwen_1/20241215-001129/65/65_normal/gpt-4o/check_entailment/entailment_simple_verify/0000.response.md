Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the program correctly processes the input, counts the occurrences of each balloon color, and checks if it is possible to distribute the balloons without any friend receiving two balloons of the same color. The program accurately sets the `can_distribute` flag based on the counts and prints the appropriate response. Given the annotations and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate.
