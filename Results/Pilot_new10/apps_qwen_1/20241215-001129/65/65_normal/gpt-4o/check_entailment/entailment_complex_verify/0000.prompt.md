You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether Kefa can distribute all balloons among his friends such that no friend gets two balloons of the same color. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `k` and the string `s` representing the colors of the balloons.
2. **Color Counting**: It accurately counts the occurrences of each color using a dictionary `color_count`.
3. **Distribution Check**: It checks if the count of any color exceeds the number of friends `k`. If it does, it sets `can_distribute` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
4. **Output**: Based on the value of `can_distribute`, it prints either "YES" or "NO".

Given the examples and the problem description, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There are no scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements based on the provided logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100, and s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters representing the colors of the balloons.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `color_count` is a dictionary where the keys are unique characters from `s` and the values are the counts of those characters in `s`.
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `can_distribute` is a boolean indicating whether it is possible to distribute the colors such that each color appears at most `k` times, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string, and `color_count` is a dictionary where the keys are unique characters from `s` and the values are the counts of those characters in `s`.
    if can_distribute :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`can_distribute` is a boolean indicating whether it is possible to distribute the colors such that each color appears at most `k` times. If `can_distribute` is true, the condition remains unchanged. If `can_distribute` is false, it remains false. `n`, `k`, `s`, and `color_count` retain their original states as described in the precondition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (both within the range of 1 to 100) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters representing the colors of the balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color in the string and checks if it is possible to distribute the colors such that no color appears more than `k` times. If such a distribution is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
