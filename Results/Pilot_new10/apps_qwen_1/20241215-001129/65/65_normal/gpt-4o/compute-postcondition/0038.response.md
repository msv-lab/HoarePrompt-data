The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 100\), and a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters representing the colors of the balloons. The function returns a value based on the given conditions but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` (both within the range of 1 to 100) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and return a value based on some conditions related to the parameters and the string.
