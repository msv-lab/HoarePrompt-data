The code `substr = s[i:j]` assigns a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` to the variable `substr`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `substr` is now the substring of `s` starting from index 0 and ending just before index 1, which means `substr` is an empty string if `s` is not empty. Since `i` is 0, the slice will start from the beginning of `s` and go up to but not including the character at index 1. This does not change the value of `i` or `n`, and `max_len` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `substr` is an empty string if `s` is not empty.**
