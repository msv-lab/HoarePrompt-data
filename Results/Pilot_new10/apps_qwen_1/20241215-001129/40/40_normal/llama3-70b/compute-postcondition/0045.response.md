`max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to `j-1`, the length of `substr` is `j - i`. The value of `max_len` will be the maximum of `max_len` and `j - i`. The values of `substr`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_len` is the maximum of its current value and `j - i`; `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to `j-1`; `i` is `n`; `n` is a positive integer**
