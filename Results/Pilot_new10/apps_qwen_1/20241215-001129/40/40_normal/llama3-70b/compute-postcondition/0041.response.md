The code updates `max_len` by taking the maximum value between `max_len` and `len(substr)`. Given that `substr` is an empty string, `len(substr)` is 0. The value of `max_len` will therefore be updated to be the maximum of its current value and 0.

The states of the other variables (`substr` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`max_len` is the maximum of its current value and 0; `substr` is an empty string; `i` is `n`; `n` is a positive integer.**
