Let's break down the given state and the for loop statement step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information
- The initial state before the loop starts:
  - `i` is equal to `n`
  - `n` must be greater than 0
  - `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`
  - `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found

- The for loop statement:
  ```
  for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (this condition is already satisfied by the given state).

2. **Range of the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over values of `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n + 1`.

3. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, the first value of `j` would be `i + 1 = n + 1`.
   - However, the loop range goes up to `n + 1`, which means the loop will not execute if `n + 1` is within the range.

4. **Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute at all, the initial value of `j` (which is `i + 1`) must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - Given that `i = n`, the condition `i + 1 <= n + 1` simplifies to `n + 1 <= n + 1`, which is always true.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that the loop starts with a valid value of `i` such that the loop can iterate meaningfully.
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is not equal to `n` to allow the loop to start and execute.

### Conclusion

To ensure the loop can execute, `i` should not be equal to `n`. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 0, as stated in the initial condition.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:

**State: **`i` is not equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`, `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found**.
