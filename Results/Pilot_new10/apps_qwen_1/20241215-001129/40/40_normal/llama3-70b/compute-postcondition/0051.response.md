The function `func` accepts an implicit input which is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters. The function iterates through all possible substrings of the input string to find the longest palindromic substring. If such a substring is found, the function prints its length. If no palindromic substring is found, it prints `0`.

Step-by-step analysis:
- The function takes an input string `s`.
- It calculates the length of the string `n`.
- It uses two nested loops to generate all possible substrings of `s`.
- For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
- If a palindromic substring is found, it updates `max_len` to store the maximum length of any palindromic substring found.
- After checking all substrings, it prints the length of the longest palindromic substring found or `0` if none was found.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters and prints the length of the longest palindromic substring found in the string, or `0` if no palindromic substring is present.**
