The code initializes `max_len` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters; `n` is the length of `s`; `max_len` is 0.**
