Postcondition: ***`max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`; `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`; `i` is `n`; `n` is a positive integer; if `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is the maximum between its current value and 0, and `substr` becomes an empty string.***
