Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`.
   - `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and 0, and `substr` becomes an empty string.

2. **Analyze the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be within the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is `n`, the loop effectively starts from `n + 1` and goes up to `n + 1`, which means it does not enter the loop because `n + 1` is not greater than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop condition `j < n + 1` is never satisfied (because `i` is equal to `n`), there are no changes needed to the states.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The states remain unchanged because the loop will not execute again.

**Final State:**
- `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`.
- `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is the maximum between its current value and 0, and `substr` becomes an empty string.

**State: **`max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`; `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`; `i` is `n`; `n` is a positive integer; if `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is the maximum between its current value and 0, and `substr` becomes an empty string**
