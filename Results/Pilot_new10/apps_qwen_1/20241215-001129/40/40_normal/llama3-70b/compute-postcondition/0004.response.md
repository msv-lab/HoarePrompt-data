Let's break down the given information and determine what states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `max_len` is 0.

### For Loop Statement
```
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variables and Their States:**
   - `s`: The string `s` is already provided as a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
   - `n`: It is mentioned that `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `max_len`: This variable is set to 0 initially.

2. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop runs for values of `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n + 1` (exclusive).

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be an integer such that `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` must be less than `n`.

### Required States
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to define a valid initial state for `i` that satisfies the loop condition. Let's choose `i = 0` for simplicity, although `i` could be any value less than `n`:

- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 0 (already given).

### Final State
The final state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
- `i` is 0 (or any value less than `n`, but 0 is a safe choice),
- `n` must be greater than 0 (already given).

So, the adjusted state is:
**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is 0**.
