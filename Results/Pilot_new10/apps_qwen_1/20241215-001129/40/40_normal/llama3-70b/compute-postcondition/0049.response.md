The code prints the value of `max_len` if `max_len` is greater than 0, otherwise it prints 0. This does not assign any new values to the variables; it only prints a value based on the condition. The variables `max_len`, `substr`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`, `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s`, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of `s`.**
