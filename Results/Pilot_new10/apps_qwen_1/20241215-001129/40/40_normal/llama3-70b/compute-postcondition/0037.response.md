The code updates the value of `max_len` by comparing it with the length of `substr`. Given the initial state, `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found from index `i` to `n-1`, and `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found from index `i` to `n-1`. Since `substr` is an empty string, `len(substr)` is 0. Therefore, `max_len` will be updated to the maximum between its current value and 0.

Output State: **`max_len` is the maximum between its current value and 0; `substr` is an empty string; `i` is `n`; `n` is a positive integer.**
