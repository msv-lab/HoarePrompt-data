The code snippet `substr = s[i:j]` attempts to slice the string `s` from index `i` to index `j`. However, given the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer. In Python, slicing a string with an `i` that is equal to its length (or greater) results in an empty string. The values of the other variables (`max_len`, `substr`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged because the code only affects `substr`.

Output State: **`max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`; `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`; `i` is `n`; `n` is a positive integer; `substr` is an empty string**
