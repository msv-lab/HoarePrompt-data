Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `substr` is an empty string if `s` is not empty. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, the postcondition holds true as per the if part's description; otherwise, no change occurs since there is no else part provided.***
