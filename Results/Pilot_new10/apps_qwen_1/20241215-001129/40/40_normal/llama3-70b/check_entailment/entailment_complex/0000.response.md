Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program finds the length of the longest palindromic substring in the given string, whereas the problem description requires finding the length of the longest non-palindromic substring. 

In the annotated program, the nested loops iterate through all possible substrings of the input string `s`. For each substring, it checks if the substring is not a palindrome (`if substr != substr[::-1]`). If it is not a palindrome, it updates `max_len` with the length of the current non-palindromic substring. However, this logic incorrectly identifies the longest palindromic substring instead of the longest non-palindromic substring.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if the substring is a palindrome and skip it if it is. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if substr == substr[::-1]:
                continue  # Skip palindromic substrings
            max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
    
    print(max_len)
```

This corrected program will correctly identify and print the length of the longest non-palindromic substring, adhering to the problem description.
