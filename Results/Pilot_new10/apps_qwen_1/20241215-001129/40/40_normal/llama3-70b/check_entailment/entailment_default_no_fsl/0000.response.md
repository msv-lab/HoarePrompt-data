Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code finds the length of the longest palindromic substring instead of the longest non-palindromic substring. This is evident from the output hints and the problem description. The program checks for palindromic substrings and calculates their lengths, which is the opposite of what the problem requires. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
