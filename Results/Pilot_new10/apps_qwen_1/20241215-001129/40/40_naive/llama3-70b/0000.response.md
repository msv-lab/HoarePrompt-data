Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the longest substring that is not a palindrome. It iterates through all possible substrings of the input string `s` and checks if each substring is a palindrome. If a substring is not a palindrome, it updates the maximum length accordingly. Finally, it prints the maximum length found or `0` if no such substring exists.

The program handles all given examples correctly:
- For the input "mew", the output is `3` because "mew" is the longest substring that is not a palindrome.
- For the input "wuffuw", the output is `5` because "wuffuw" is the longest substring that is not a palindrome.
- For the input "qqqqqqqq", the output is `0` because all substrings are palindromes.

Since the program works correctly for all tested cases and the logic is sound, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
