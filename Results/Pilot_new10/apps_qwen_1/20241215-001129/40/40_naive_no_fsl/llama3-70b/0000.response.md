Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the longest substring that is not a palindrome in the given word. It iterates through all possible substrings of the input string `s`, checks if each substring is a palindrome, and keeps track of the maximum length of non-palindrome substrings. If no such substring exists, it prints `0`. The program handles all the provided examples correctly and seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
