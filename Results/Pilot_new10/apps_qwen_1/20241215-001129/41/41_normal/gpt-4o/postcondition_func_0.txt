The function processes a list of \(n\) tuples \((a_i, b_i)\) where \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 4126\). It checks if any \(a_i \neq b_i\) to determine if the ratings are rated. If not, it checks if the first elements of consecutive tuples are strictly increasing to determine if the ratings are unrated. If neither condition is met, it prints 'maybe'.
