According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, since `n` must be greater than 1, `n` remains unchanged but still needs to satisfy this condition.

The other states (`ratings`, `is_unrated`, and `is_rated`) remain the same because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to these variables within the loop.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples, `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` is `False`**
