Postcondition: ***`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n - 1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, `ratings` is a list containing two tuples (`a`, `b`), `is_unrated` is `False`, `is_rated` is `True` if `a` is not equal to `b`, otherwise `True`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition if the condition `a != b` is true.***
