The code snippet prints the string 'rated'. This does not affect the values of the variables directly, but it does indicate an action has been taken. The output of the print statement is a string, but since no new variable is assigned this value, it does not change the state of any variables.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings` is a list containing exactly n tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` is unchanged, and `i` is set to `n`. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 1; the program prints 'rated'**
