Postcondition: ***`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), and either 'unrated' or 'maybe' is printed to the console. `is_unrated` is `False` and `is_rated` is `False`.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, indicating the possible outcomes after the if-else block executes based on the value of `is_unrated`.
