`ratings.append((a, b))` adds the tuple `(a, b)` to the list `ratings`. This operation does not change the values of `a`, `b`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `is_unrated`, or `is_rated`. The only change is in the `ratings` list, which now contains the additional tuple.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n - 1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, `ratings` is a list containing two tuples (`a`, `b`), `is_unrated` is `False`, `is_rated` is `True` if `a` is not equal to `b`, otherwise `True`**
