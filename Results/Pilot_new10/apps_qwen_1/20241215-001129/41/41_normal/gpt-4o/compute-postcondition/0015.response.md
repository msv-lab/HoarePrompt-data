Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - \( n \) is within the range \( 2 \leq n - 1 \leq 1000 \).
   - \( a \) is an input integer.
   - \( b \) is an input integer.
   - \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) are not yet defined.
   - \( \text{ratings} \) is a list containing two tuples \((a, b)\).
   - \( \text{is_unrated} \) is `False`.
   - \( \text{is_rated} \) is `True` if \( a \neq b \), otherwise `True`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for \( n \) iterations.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration, the loop body is omitted, but we need to consider how the loop state changes.

4. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we need to infer the changes based on the given conditions and the loop structure.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop runs from 0 to \( n-1 \). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, \( i \) (the loop variable) will be incremented by 1.
   - Since the loop runs \( n \) times, after \( n-1 \) iterations, the loop will run for the \( n \)-th time when \( i = n-1 \).

6. **Post-loop State:**
   - After \( n-1 \) iterations, \( i \) will be \( n-1 \).
   - The list \( \text{ratings} \) will still contain the initial tuples \((a, b)\) because the loop body does not modify it.
   - The values of \( a \) and \( b \) remain unchanged.
   - \( \text{is_unrated} \) remains `False` since it was initially `False` and the loop does not change this.
   - \( \text{is_rated} \) remains `True` if \( a \neq b \), otherwise `True`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is the \( n \)-th iteration of the loop) will be:

State: **`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, `ratings` is a list containing two tuples (`a`, `b`), `is_unrated` is `False`, `is_rated` is `True` if `a` is not equal to `b`, otherwise `True`.**
