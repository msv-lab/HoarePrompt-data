Postcondition: ***`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), `is_unrated` is `True`, and `is_rated` remains unchanged. If the condition inside the if statement is true, `i` is set to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\). If the condition inside the if statement is false, `i` is set to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\).***
