According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions apply:

- `n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined.
- `ratings` is a list containing one tuple `(a, b)`.
- `is_unrated` is `False`.
- `is_rated` is `True` if `a` is not equal to `b`. Otherwise, it is `True`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1, making it `n - 1`. Since the loop requires `n` to be greater than 0, `n` must still be within the range 2 ≤ n - 1 ≤ 1000.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n - 1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, `ratings` is a list containing one tuple `(a, b)`, `is_unrated` is `False`, and `is_rated` is `True` if `a` is not equal to `b`. Otherwise, the same conditions apply as the precondition.**
