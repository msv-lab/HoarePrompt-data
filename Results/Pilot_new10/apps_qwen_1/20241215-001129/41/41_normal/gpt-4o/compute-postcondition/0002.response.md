`is_rated` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `n`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `ratings` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`**
