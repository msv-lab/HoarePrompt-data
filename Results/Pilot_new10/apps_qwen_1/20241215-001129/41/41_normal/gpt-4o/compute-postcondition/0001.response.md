The code initializes an empty list named `ratings`. This does not affect the value of `n` or the undefined variables `a_i` and `b_i`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, `ratings` is an empty list**
