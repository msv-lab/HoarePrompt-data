The code simply assigns `True` to the variable `is_unrated`. The value of `is_rated` remains unchanged as `False`. The value of `n` and the structure of `ratings` are also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples, `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` is `False`**
