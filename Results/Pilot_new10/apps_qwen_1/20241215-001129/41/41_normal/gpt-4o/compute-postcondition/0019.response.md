Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `ratings` contains the initial tuples \((a, b)\) plus the new tuple \((a, b)\), `is_unrated` is `False`, `is_rated` is `True` if \(a \neq b\), otherwise `True`. Since there is no else part, the `is_rated` flag remains unchanged.***
