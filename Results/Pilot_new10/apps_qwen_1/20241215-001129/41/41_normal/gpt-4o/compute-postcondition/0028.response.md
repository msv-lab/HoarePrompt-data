The code sets `is_unrated` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, or any other variables. Therefore, the only change is to the value of `is_unrated`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples, `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` is `False`**
