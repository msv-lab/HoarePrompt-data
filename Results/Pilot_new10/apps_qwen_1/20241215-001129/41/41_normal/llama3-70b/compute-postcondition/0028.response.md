Postcondition: ***`ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of integers, `i` is the same as the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 2`. If `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, `unrated` is set to `False`. If the condition is not met, `unrated` retains its original value (which is `True` in this case since there's no explicit mention of its initial state in the else part).***
