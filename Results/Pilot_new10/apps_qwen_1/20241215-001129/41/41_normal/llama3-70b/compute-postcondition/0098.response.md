Functionality: ** The function processes a series of ratings before and after an event. It checks if there is any inconsistency where a participant's rating decreases relative to another participant who had a higher initial rating but ended up with a lower final rating. If such an inconsistency exists, the function prints 'maybe'. If no such inconsistency exists, it further checks if any participant's rating changed. If at least one participant's rating changed, it prints 'rated'. If no participant's rating changed, it prints 'unrated'. **

This summary covers the functionality based on the code provided and includes all potential cases:
- Checking for inconsistencies in ratings.
- Verifying if any ratings changed.
- Determining the appropriate output ('rated', 'unrated', or 'maybe') based on the findings.
