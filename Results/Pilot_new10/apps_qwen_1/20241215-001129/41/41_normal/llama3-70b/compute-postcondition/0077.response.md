The code `break` is used to exit the loop or the most nested block it is in. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most nested block it was inside. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`, and the current value of `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`; `rated` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
