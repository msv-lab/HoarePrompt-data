The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or switch statement it is inside. Since no loop or switch statement context is provided in the initial state, we assume the `break` statement simply breaks out of a hypothetical loop or context it would be in. Given this, the variables `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `i`, `j`, and `unrated` retain their original values.

Output State: **`ratings_before` is a list of integers, `ratings_after` is a list of integers, `i` is the same as the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 3`, `unrated` is `False`.**
