`ratings_before` appends the value of `a` to itself. Since `ratings_before` was initially a list containing two elements both equal to `input_value_of_a`, appending `a` means `ratings_before` now contains three elements: `input_value_of_a`, `input_value_of_a`, and `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the values of `ratings_after`, `a`, and `b` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 0 and 998; `ratings_before` is `[input_value_of_a, input_value_of_a, a]`; `ratings_after` is `[input_value_of_b, input_value_of_b]; a` is the first integer input by the user; `b` is the second integer input by the user.**
