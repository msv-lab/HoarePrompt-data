`a` and `b` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which converts the input into integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since the input is split into two parts, `a` and `b` will hold these values. The states of `n`, `ratings_before`, and `ratings_after` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
