The code appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. The initial state is that `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are both empty lists, and `a` and `b` are input integers. After appending `a` to `ratings_before`, the list `ratings_before` will contain the value of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is `[a]`, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
