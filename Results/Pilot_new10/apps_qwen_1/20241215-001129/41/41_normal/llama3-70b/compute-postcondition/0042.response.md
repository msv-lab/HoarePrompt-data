Postcondition: ***`unrated` is `False`, `j` is `i + 1`, and there exists an index `j > i + 1` such that `ratings_before[i + 1] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i + 1] > ratings_after[j]`. Additionally, if `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.***
