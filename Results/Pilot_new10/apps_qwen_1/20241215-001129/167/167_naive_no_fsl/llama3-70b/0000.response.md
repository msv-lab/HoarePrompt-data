Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks whether a given path is valid based on the Manhattan distance between cells, but it does not fully validate the movement constraints specified in the problem description. 

The issue lies in the way `func_1` calculates the coordinates of the current cell `(nx, ny)` using the formula `((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)`. This formula assumes that the matrix is 1-indexed and zero-based, which is not explicitly stated in the problem. However, the problem specifies that the matrix is filled in a specific way, and the indices should be adjusted accordingly.

A more detailed check would require ensuring that the calculated coordinates `(nx, ny)` actually correspond to a valid move based on the allowed directions (up, down, left, right). The current implementation of `func_1` does not fully account for these constraints.

For instance, consider the input:
```
8
1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2
```
The output should be `YES` and the dimensions could be `3 3`, but the current program might fail to correctly identify this as a valid path due to the misinterpretation of the movement constraints.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the calculated coordinates `(nx, ny)` are within the bounds of the matrix and that the movement is valid according to the specified rules.
