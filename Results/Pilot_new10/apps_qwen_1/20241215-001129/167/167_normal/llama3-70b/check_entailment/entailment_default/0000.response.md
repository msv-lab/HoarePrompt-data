Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly determine whether the path is valid for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1(x, y)` checks if the path is valid by converting each integer in the sequence `a` back to its (i, j) coordinates in the matrix and verifying that each step is adjacent. However, the code does not actually check the adjacency of steps in the sequence `a`.

The function `func_1(x, y)` calculates the (i, j) coordinates for each integer in `a` using the formula `(v - 1) // y` and `(v - 1) % y`. It then checks if the Manhattan distance between consecutive coordinates is 1, which is a necessary condition for the cells to be adjacent. However, it does not verify that the path actually follows the rules of movement defined in the problem description (i.e., moving to a directly adjacent cell).

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
Input:
8
1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2
```

The path described by these numbers would look like this in a 3x3 matrix:

```
1 2 3
6 7 8
9 10 5
```

The actual path taken is not valid because moving from 2 to 6 and then to 9 does not follow the rule of moving to an adjacent cell. The code would incorrectly validate this path because it does not enforce the adjacency condition properly.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case and thus is incorrect.
