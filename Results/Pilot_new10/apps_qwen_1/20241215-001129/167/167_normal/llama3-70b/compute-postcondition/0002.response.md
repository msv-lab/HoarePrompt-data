The given code snippet does not form a complete Python code snippet because it lacks the definition of variables `v` and `y`, and it does not assign values to them before being used. However, based on the structure, let's assume the following initial state for the sake of this exercise:

- `v` and `y` are integers.

The code snippet assigns the quotient and remainder of `(v - 1)` divided by `y` to `nx` and `ny` respectively.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Calculate `v - 1`.
2. Divide the result by `y` to get the quotient, which is assigned to `nx`.
3. Get the remainder when `v - 1` is divided by `y`, which is assigned to `ny`.

The initial state does not provide specific values for `v` and `y`. Therefore, we cannot determine specific values for `nx` and `ny`. We can only express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `v` and `y`.

- `nx = (v - 1) // y`
- `ny = (v - 1) % y`

Since no other variables are affected, the output state is:

Output State: **`nx` is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`, `v` is a specific integer, `y` is a specific integer.**
