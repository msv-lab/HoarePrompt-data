`subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. From the initial state, we know that `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // next_subtask_time` if `remaining_time` >= `next_subtask_time`; otherwise, no change. Also, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is already calculated, adding it to `subtasks_solved` means `subtasks_solved` is now `subtasks_solved + (remaining_time // subtask_time)`.

The values of `remaining_time`, `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:
- `subtasks_solved` is now `subtasks_solved + (remaining_time // subtask_time)`

Output State: **`remaining_time` is adjusted according to the condition whether it is greater than or equal to the next `subtask_time` in the list `t`, `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + (remaining_time // subtask_time)`, `subtask_time` remains the same, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `t` is a non-empty list**
