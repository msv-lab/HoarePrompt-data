The code updates `max_points` to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`. Given the initial state:

- `remaining_time` is 0
- `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its current value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0
- `subtask_time` is the last `subtask_time` used in the loop
- `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points`
- `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `t` is an empty list

After the code runs:

- `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`max_points`) and `points + subtasks_solved`

Since `subtasks_solved` is defined as the minimum of its current value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, and `points` is defined as `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, the new value of `max_points` will be the maximum of `max_points` and `complete_tasks * (k + 1) + min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its current value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, `subtask_time` is the last `subtask_time` used in the loop, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `complete_tasks * (k + 1) + min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `t` is an empty list.**
