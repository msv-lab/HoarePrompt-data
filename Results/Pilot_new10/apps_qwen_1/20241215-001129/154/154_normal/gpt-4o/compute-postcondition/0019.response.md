The code `remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` updates the value of `remaining_time` by subtracting `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` from it. However, the values of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time` are not provided in the initial state. Assuming `subtask_time` is a constant or another variable, let's proceed with the given information.

Since the initial state does not specify a value for `subtask_time`, we will represent it as a placeholder. The value of `remaining_time` will be updated based on the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is `4 - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is 4, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0**
