`subtasks_solved` is incremented by the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, which was calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is `M - (complete_tasks * total_time_per_task)`, `subtasks_solved` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `t` must be a non-empty list, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and the remaining time is greater than or equal to the subtask time**.
