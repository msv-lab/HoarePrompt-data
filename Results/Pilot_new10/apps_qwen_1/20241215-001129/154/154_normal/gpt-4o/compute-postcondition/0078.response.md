Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks solved, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, `subtask_time` is the last `subtask_time` used in the loop, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `t` is an empty list.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Condition:** The loop continues to execute as long as there is `remaining_time` that is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.
2. **Effect of Each Iteration:**
   - In each iteration, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `remaining_time` is reduced by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`.
   - If `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, the loop does not increment `subtasks_solved` further and stops.
3. **Final State:**
   - Once `remaining_time` is less than any `subtask_time`, the loop exits, meaning `remaining_time` will be 0.
   - `subtasks_solved` will be the total number of subtasks solved during the entire execution of the loop.
   - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` will be 0 because it is updated to `remaining_time // subtask_time` when `remaining_time` is reduced.
   - `subtask_time` will be the last `subtask_time` used in the loop since it is unchanged within the loop.
   - `t` will be an empty list because once the loop exits, no further iterations are possible.
   - `time_used`, `max_points`, and `points` retain their values from the beginning of the loop, unaffected by the loop's execution.
