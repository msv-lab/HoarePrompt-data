Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), `M` (a non-negative integer), and `t` (a list of positive integers). It calculates the maximum points one can achieve by completing tasks within a given time limit `M`. Points are earned based on the number of complete tasks and additional points for solving subtasks. The function returns the maximum value of points plus the number of subtasks solved.**

This summary covers the following aspects:
- The function iterates over possible numbers of complete tasks (`complete_tasks`) from 0 to `n`.
- For each iteration, it calculates the total time used (`time_used`) and checks if it exceeds the time limit `M`. If it does, the loop breaks.
- Points are calculated as `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
- Remaining time is calculated as `M - time_used`.
- It then iterates over the subtasks in the list `t` to determine the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within the remaining time.
- The number of subtasks solved is limited by the remaining time and the number of remaining tasks (`n - complete_tasks`).
- Finally, the function updates `max_points` with the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` obtained during the iterations.
