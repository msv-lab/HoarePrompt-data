To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and operations step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `remaining_time` is updated as `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`
- `subtasks_solved` is updated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is updated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`
- `subtask_time` remains unchanged
- `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points`
- `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `t` must be a non-empty list
- `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time`
- The function performs these operations if and only if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`

### Loop Condition
The loop iterates over each element in the list `t`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.

2. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `subtask_time` remains unchanged.
   - `t` must still be a non-empty list.
   - `subtasks_solved` will be increased by the value of `remaining_time // subtask_time` from the previous iteration.
   - `remaining_time` will be updated based on the previous iteration's operations.

3. **Key States to Adjust:**
   - `remaining_time` should be set to `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`
   - `subtasks_solved` should be increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time` from the previous iteration
   - `subtask_time` remains unchanged
   - `t` must still be a non-empty list

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `remaining_time` is `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`
- `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time` from the previous iteration
- `subtask_time` remains unchanged
- `t` must still be a non-empty list

### Final State:
State: **`remaining_time` is `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time` from the previous iteration, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `t` must be a non-empty list**
