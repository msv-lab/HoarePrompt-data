The code updates the value of `time_used` to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. This means that the value of `time_used` is now equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is \(\min(\text{subtasks\_solved}, (n - (\text{complete\_tasks} + 1)) * k)\), `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points + \text{subtasks\_solved}`, `points` is unchanged.**
