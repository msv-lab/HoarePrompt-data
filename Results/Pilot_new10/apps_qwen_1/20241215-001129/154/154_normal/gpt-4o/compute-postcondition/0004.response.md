Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `time_used` is `c * total_time_per_task`, and `max_points` is 0. The current value of `time_used` is greater than `M`.**
