`complete_tasks` is a variable that is not defined before the code snippet. However, based on the given code snippet, it seems like `complete_tasks` should be a variable that holds a value, which when multiplied by `total_time_per_task`, assigns the result to `time_used`. Since `complete_tasks` is not specified, let's denote its value as `c`. 

After the line `time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` is executed, `time_used` will be assigned the value of `c * total_time_per_task`. 

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `max_points`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `time_used` is `c * total_time_per_task`, and `max_points` is 0.**
