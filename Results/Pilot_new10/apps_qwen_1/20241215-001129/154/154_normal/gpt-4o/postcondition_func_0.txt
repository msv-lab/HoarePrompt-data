The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), `M` (a non-negative integer), and `t` (a list of positive integers). It calculates the maximum points one can achieve by completing tasks within a given time limit `M`. Points are earned based on the number of complete tasks and additional points for solving subtasks. The function returns the maximum value of points plus the number of subtasks solved.
