Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into parts.
   - It correctly parses the values of `n`, `k`, and `M` from the input.
   - It constructs the list `t` containing the times required to solve each subtask.

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function calculates the total time required to complete one full task (`total_time_per_task`).
   - It iterates over possible numbers of fully completed tasks (from 0 to `n` inclusive).
   - For each number of fully completed tasks, it checks if the total time used exceeds `M`. If it does, the loop breaks early.
   - It calculates the points earned from completing these tasks (`complete_tasks * (k + 1)`).
   - It then calculates the remaining time available and determines how many additional subtasks can be solved within this remaining time.
   - The function ensures that the number of subtasks solved does not exceed the limit imposed by the remaining time and the number of incomplete tasks.
   - It keeps track of the maximum points achieved across all iterations.

3. **Correct Handling of Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem description, including the limits on `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t_j`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn, as required by the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program accurately implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
