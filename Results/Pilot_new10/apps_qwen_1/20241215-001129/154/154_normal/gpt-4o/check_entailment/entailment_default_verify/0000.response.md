Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit \( M \). The function `func_1` accurately handles all potential cases, including the calculation of points from fully completing tasks and solving additional subtasks within the remaining time. The output hints confirm that the function correctly processes the input parameters and computes the desired result. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
