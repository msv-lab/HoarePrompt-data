Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the input as specified, with `n`, `k`, `M`, and the list `t` of subtask times.
   - The input parsing ensures that the data types and constraints match the problem requirements.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time `M`.
   - It iterates over possible complete tasks from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
   - For each possible number of complete tasks, it calculates the time used and the points earned.
   - It then calculates the remaining time and determines the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time.
   - Finally, it updates the maximum points considering both the complete tasks and the additional subtasks solved.

3. **Time Complexity Consideration**:
   - The function ensures that the time taken to solve subtasks is correctly accounted for, even when solving subtasks partially across different tasks.
   - The nested loops ensure that all possible combinations of complete tasks and subtasks are considered to maximize points.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `M` is very small, allowing no tasks to be completed, and when `M` is large enough to solve many tasks and subtasks.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the maximum number of points that can be earned, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
