To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the logic of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `M`.
- The initial state of `dp[i][j]` is `dp[i][j - 1]`.
- `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.
- `dp[i][j+1]` is equal to the maximum of its current value (which is the same as `dp[i][j]`) and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i]] + 1`.
- The condition for updating `dp[i][j+1]` remains the same.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.
- `dp[i][j+1]` is equal to the maximum of its current value (which is the same as `dp[i][j]`) and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i]] + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value `k` (let's say `j = k`).

2. **Update of `dp[i][j]`:**
   - The new value of `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.
   - This means that `dp[i][j]` is now updated to this new value.

3. **Update of `dp[i][j+1]`:**
   - The new value of `dp[i][j+1]` is the maximum of its current value (which is the same as `dp[i][j]`) and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i]] + 1`.
   - This means that `dp[i][j+1]` is now updated to this new value if the condition holds.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` needs to be within the range `[1, M]`.

5. **Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it executes, the next value of `j` will be `k + 1`.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration:
- `dp[i][j]` will be updated to `dp[i][j + 1]` based on the previous update.
- `dp[i][j+1]` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i]] + 1` if the condition holds.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`dp[i][j]` is the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`, `dp[i][j+1]` is the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i]] + 1` if the condition holds, `j` is `k + 1`.**
