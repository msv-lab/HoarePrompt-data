Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is the maximum value achievable by selecting elements from the list `t` up to the current index `i - 1` such that the sum does not exceed the current value of `j`. For all `j` in the range `[0, M]`, `dp[i][j]` contains the optimal solution for the subproblem where the sum of selected elements does not exceed `j`. The variables `i`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `dp` remain unchanged after the loop finishes executing.**
