The code snippet `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the same as `dp[i][j - 1]`. This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is now the same as it was before, which is the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`, given the initial state.

The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`, `dp[i][j+1]` is the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i]] + 1` if the condition holds, `j` is `k + 1`, and `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**
