Postcondition: **`dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`, while `dp[i][j]` was initially equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. `dp[i][j+1]` is equal to the maximum of its current value (which is the same as `dp[i][j]`) and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i]] + 1`, and the condition for updating `dp[i][j+1]` remains the same.**
