Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is the same as `dp[i][j-1]`) and `dp[i-1][j-t[i-1]] + 1`, but only if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i-1]`.
   - This implies that `dp[i][j]` might have been updated if the condition `j >= t[i-1]` was satisfied.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `M`.

3. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be the highest value it could have reached without triggering the update (i.e., `j < t[i-1]`), or it might have been updated if `j >= t[i-1]`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will increment by 1, becoming `j + 1`.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j + 1` must still be within the range `[1, M]`.
   - If `j + 1 >= t[i]`, then `dp[i][j+1]` will be updated similarly to how `dp[i][j]` was updated previously.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since `j` increases by 1, we need to check the new condition for updating `dp[i][j+1]`.
   - If `j + 1 >= t[i]`, then `dp[i][j+1]` will be updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i-1][j+1-t[i]] + 1`.

Given the above steps, let's summarize the state adjustments:

- `dp[i][j]` might have been updated if `j >= t[i-1]`.
- For the next iteration, `j` becomes `j + 1`.
- The new condition for updating `dp[i][j+1]` is `j + 1 >= t[i]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`dp[i][j]` is equal to the maximum of its current value (which is the same as `dp[i][j-1]`) and `dp[i-1][j-t[i-1]] + 1`, and this update occurs if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i-1]`. For the next iteration, `j` becomes `j + 1`, and the condition for updating `dp[i][j+1]` is `j + 1 >= t[i]`.** 

So, the specific state can be written as:
State: **`dp[i][j+1]` is equal to the maximum of its current value (which is the same as `dp[i][j]`) and `dp[i-1][j+1-t[i]] + 1`, and this update occurs if `j + 1` is greater than or equal to `t[i]`.**
