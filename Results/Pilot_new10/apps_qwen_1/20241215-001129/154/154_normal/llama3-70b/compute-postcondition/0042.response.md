The code updates `dp[i][j]` to be the maximum of its current value (`dp[i][j]`) and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` could potentially change based on the value of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. However, the initial state specifies that `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.

Given this, the new value of `dp[i][j]` will be:

\[ dp[i][j] = \max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1) \]

This means that `dp[i][j]` is now updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. The value of `dp[i][j]` is dependent on the value of `t[i - 1]` and the value in `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]`.

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`, while `dp[i][j]` was initially equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`; `dp[i][j+1]` is equal to the maximum of its current value (which is the same as `dp[i][j]`) and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i]] + 1`, and the condition for updating `dp[i][j+1]` remains the same.**
