Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) where each element is the maximum value achievable by selecting elements from the list `t` up to the current index `i - 1` such that the sum does not exceed the current value of `j`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and runs until `i` reaches `k + 1`.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `j` from `1` to `M`, the loop updates `dp[i][j]` based on whether adding `t[i-1]` to the sum (up to `j - t[i-1]`) would yield a higher value compared to the previous value `dp[i][j - 1]`.
   - The loop continues updating `dp[i][j]` for all `j` from `1` to `M` for each `i` from `1` to `k + 1`.
3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `dp` will be updated according to the logic inside the loop, capturing the maximum count of elements from `t` that can be selected such that their sum does not exceed any value from `1` to `M`.

Since the loop runs from `1` to `M` for each `i` from `1` to `k + 1`, and considering the conditions inside the loop, the final state of `dp` will reflect the maximum achievable counts for sums up to `M` using elements from `t` up to the last index `k`.
