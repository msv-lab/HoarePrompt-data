Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\), and `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum value achievable by selecting elements from the list `t` up to the current index `i - 1` such that the sum does not exceed the current value of `j`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `M + 1`.
- For each `j`, `dp[i][j]` is initially set to `dp[i][j - 1]`.
- If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)`, meaning it considers adding the current element `t[i - 1]` to the sum up to the previous index `i - 1`.

After all iterations of the loop, the `dp` table will contain the maximum values for all possible sums up to `M` using the elements from the list `t` up to index `i - 1`. Since the loop runs until `j` reaches `M + 1`, the final state of `dp` will reflect the maximum values achievable for all possible sums within the constraints defined by `M` and the elements in `t`.
