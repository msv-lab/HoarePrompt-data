The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the same as the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is now the same as what `dp[i][j - 1]` was before this line of code was executed. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is equal to the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`; other variables remain unchanged.**
