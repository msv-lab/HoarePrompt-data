`n`, `k`, and `M` are assigned the values from the input using the `map(int, input().split())` function. This means that each of these variables will be assigned an integer value from the input, in the order they are provided. The input will be split into individual elements and then converted to integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is an integer between 0 and 2Â·10^9, and we have read the next line of input which contains `k` integers `t_j`.**
