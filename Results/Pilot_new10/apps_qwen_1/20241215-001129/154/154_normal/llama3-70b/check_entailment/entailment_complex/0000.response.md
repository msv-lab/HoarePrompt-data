Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input values for `n`, `k`, and `M` in the first line.
   - It then reads the times `t_j` for each subtask in the second line.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup:**
   - A 2D DP table `dp` is initialized with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`. Each element `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points achievable using the first `i` subtasks with a time budget of `j` minutes.
   - The DP table is filled in a manner that considers whether including the `i-th` subtask would increase the score or not, ensuring the maximum points are computed.

3. **DP Table Filling:**
   - The nested loops iterate over each subtask and each possible time budget up to `M`.
   - For each cell `dp[i][j]`, the program updates the value by considering whether the current subtask (`t[i-1]`) can be included within the remaining time (`j - t[i-1]`).
   - The value `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of the current value and the value obtained by solving the previous subtask within the remaining time plus one additional point.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - After filling the DP table, the program calculates the final result by summing up the points from all tasks and adding the extra point for completely solving a task.
   - Specifically, `sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))` gives the total points achievable by solving subtasks without necessarily completing any task fully.
   - `sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)` counts the number of tasks that can be fully completed within the given time.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total points achieved, which is the sum of the points from partially solving subtasks and the extra points from fully solving tasks.

### Why it is Correct:
- The program correctly handles all constraints and requirements mentioned in the problem description.
- It uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the maximum points Polycarp can achieve within the given time limit.
- The logic for updating the DP table ensures that all possible combinations of subtasks are considered.
- The final output matches the expected format and calculation specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality and hence is correct.
