Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to maximize the number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time constraint. The output hints correctly describe the functionality of the program, indicating that it computes the sum of the maximum value achievable by selecting a subset of elements from \( t \) such that their sum does not exceed \( M \), and the count of valid selections. This aligns with the problem description where the goal is to find the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn by solving subtasks within a given time limit. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and there are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail.
