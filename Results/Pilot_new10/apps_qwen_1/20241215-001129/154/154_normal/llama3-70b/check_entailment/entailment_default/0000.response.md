Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code aims to maximize the number of points Polycarp can earn within \( M \) minutes, but it does not properly handle the requirement to earn an additional point if a task is completely solved (i.e., all \( k \) subtasks are completed).

Here is a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The DP table `dp[i][j]` is initialized to store the maximum points that can be earned using the first `i` subtasks and spending exactly `j` minutes. This initialization is correct.

2. **Filling the DP Table**: The inner loop iterates over possible minutes spent, and the outer loop iterates over subtasks. For each subtask and each minute, it updates the DP table based on whether including the current subtask would increase the points. This part of the code is also correct in terms of the logic for updating the DP table.

3. **Calculating the Result**: The final step calculates the total points by summing up the maximum points that can be earned for each subtask limit and adding an extra point for each fully completed task. However, the way the extra points are counted and added is flawed. The code simply adds 1 for each subtask limit `i` where `dp[i][M] == i`, which does not correctly account for the extra point for fully completing a task.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly implement the solution, you need to ensure that you count the extra points for each fully completed task. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    
    # Calculate the maximum points
    max_points = 0
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if dp[i][M] == i:
            max_points += 1  # Count the extra point for fully completed tasks
    
    # Add the points from partially completed tasks
    for i in range(k + 1):
        max_points += dp[i][M]
    
    print(max_points)


func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the extra points for fully completed tasks are correctly counted and added to the total points, thereby meeting the problem requirements.
