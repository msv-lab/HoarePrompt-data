Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the original assessment. The program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to maximize the number of points Polycarp can earn within M minutes. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at different points, confirming that the DP table `dp` is correctly updated and used to calculate the final result. The original assessment is accurate as the program handles all necessary cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.
