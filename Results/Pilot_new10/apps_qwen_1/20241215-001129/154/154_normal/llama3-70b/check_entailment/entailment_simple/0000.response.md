Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `k`, and `M` from the first line, and the times `t_j` for the subtasks from the second line. This matches the problem description.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The program initializes a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`. This table is used to store the maximum points Polycarp can earn for solving subtasks up to a certain point within the given time `M`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**: The nested loops fill the DP table according to the following logic:
   - For each subtask index `i` (from 1 to `k`), and for each possible time `j` (from 1 to `M`):
     - The state `dp[i][j]` is initialized to `dp[i][j - 1]`, which means no new subtask is added at this step.
     - If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. This accounts for the scenario where the `i-th` subtask is added, and an additional point is earned for completing the task.

4. **Result Calculation**: After filling the DP table, the program calculates the final result by:
   - Summing the values in the last column (`dp[i][M]`) of the DP table to account for the points earned from solving individual subtasks.
   - Adding the count of rows in the DP table where `dp[i][M]` equals `i`, which accounts for the additional points earned for completing tasks.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total points calculated, which matches the requirement of outputting the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn.

Since the program accurately follows the steps and logic described in the problem statement for all valid inputs, it is correct. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
