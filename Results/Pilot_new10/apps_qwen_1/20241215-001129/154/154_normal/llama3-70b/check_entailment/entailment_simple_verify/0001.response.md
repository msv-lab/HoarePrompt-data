Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly initializes and populates the DP table to find the maximum points Polycarp can earn within the given time constraint. The final result is computed by summing the points stored in the DP table and adding the extra points for fully completed tasks. The annotations clearly show that the program handles all necessary cases and constraints as specified in the problem description. Therefore, there is no evidence from the annotations to suggest that the original assessment of correctness should be changed.
