Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use to meet the required ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears respectively. 

Here's the reasoning:
- The program reads the number of lemons, apples, and pears from input.
- It then determines the maximum number of sets of fruits (lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears) that can be used, which is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
- It calculates the total number of fruits that can be used by multiplying this maximum number of sets by the respective quantities (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears).
- Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

Given the constraints and examples, the program handles all cases correctly. For instance:
- In the first example (`2 lemons, 5 apples, 7 pears`), the maximum sets that can be used are 1 (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears), resulting in a total of 7 fruits.
- In the second example (`4 lemons, 7 apples, 13 pears`), the maximum sets that can be used are 3 (3 lemons, 6 apples, 12 pears), resulting in a total of 21 fruits.
- In the third example (`2 lemons, 3 apples, 2 pears`), since there are only 2 pears, no sets can be used, resulting in a total of 0 fruits.

Since the program correctly handles all provided examples and the logic aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.
