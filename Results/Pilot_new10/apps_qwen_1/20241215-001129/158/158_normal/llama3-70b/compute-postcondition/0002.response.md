`c` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, which means the new value of `c` is the integer input by the user. The previous value of `a` and `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `c` is an integer input by the user.
Output State: **`a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `c` is an integer input by the user**
