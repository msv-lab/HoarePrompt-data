The code calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user, so their values remain unchanged. However, the variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among these three expressions. The output state includes the updated value of `min_lemon` and the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `c` is an integer input by the user, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
