Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. This matches the problem description perfectly.

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**: 
   - The program calculates the maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`) that can be used in the compote by taking the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This ensures that the number of lemons is limited by the smallest quantity that can be used according to the ratio (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears).
   - The calculation `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4` computes the total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used, adhering to the required ratio.

3. **Output**: The program prints the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote. If no fruits can be used (i.e., `max_lemons` is 0), it prints 0, which aligns with the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly:
   - If there are fewer apples than twice the number of lemons or fewer pears than four times the number of lemons, the number of lemons used will be limited accordingly.
   - If `a`, `b`, and `c` are such that no valid combination of fruits exists (e.g., `a > b // 2` or `a > c // 4`), the result will be 0, as expected.

Since the program accurately follows the logic and constraints specified in the problem description for all possible inputs, the program is correct.
