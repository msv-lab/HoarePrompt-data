Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the ratio requirement of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears. Instead, it incorrectly uses the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` to determine the number of lemons that can be used, which does not necessarily satisfy the required ratio. For example, consider the input:

- Lemons: 2
- Apples: 5
- Pears: 8

According to the problem description, Nikolay should be able to use 2 lemons, 4 apples, and 8 pears (since 2 lemons require 4 apples and 8 pears). However, the code will only use 2 lemons, 4 apples, and 8 pears, which is correct in this case. But consider another input:

- Lemons: 2
- Apples: 5
- Pears: 7

Here, the code would also use 2 lemons, 4 apples, and 8 pears, which is incorrect because there are only 7 pears available. The correct implementation should find the limiting factor based on the required ratio, not just the minimum value.
