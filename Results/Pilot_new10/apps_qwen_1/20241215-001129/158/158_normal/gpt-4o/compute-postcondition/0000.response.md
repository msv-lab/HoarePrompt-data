`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer input, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer**
