The function `func` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the empty parameter list. The functionality of the function involves three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, each constrained such that \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 1000\), but since these are not passed as arguments to the function, they must be defined within the function's scope.

Given the output cases are not explicitly defined in the problem statement, I will focus on the parameter constraints and the expected behavior based on the provided information:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns based on the internal handling of non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 1 to 1000.**
