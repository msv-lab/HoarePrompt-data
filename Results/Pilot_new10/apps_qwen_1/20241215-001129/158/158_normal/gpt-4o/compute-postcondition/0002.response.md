The code `c = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `c`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state, which is that they are integer inputs. The previous value of `c` (which was a non-negative integer) is now overwritten by the new input.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input**
