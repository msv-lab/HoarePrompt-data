Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is the sum of elements at even indices of `a`, `c` is the sum of elements at odd indices of `a`.**

Explanation:
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each iteration `i`:
  - If `i` is even, `b` accumulates the value of `a[i]`.
  - If `i` is odd, `c` accumulates the value of `a[i]`.
- Since `a` is sorted in descending order, `b` will contain the sum of the largest elements at even indices, and `c` will contain the sum of the largest elements at odd indices.

Thus, after the loop completes, `b` and `c` will hold the sums of the elements at even and odd indices respectively, of the list `a`.
