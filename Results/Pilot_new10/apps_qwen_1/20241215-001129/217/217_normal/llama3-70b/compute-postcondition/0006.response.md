`b` is assigned the value of `b` plus `a[i]`. Since `i` is initially 0 and the list `a` is sorted in descending order, `a[i]` is the largest element in the list. The value of `b` is updated to the value of `a[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is `a[0]`, `c` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` modulo 2 is 0**
