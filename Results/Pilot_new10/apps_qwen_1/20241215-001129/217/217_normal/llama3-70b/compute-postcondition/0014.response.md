According to the given for loop, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop condition is `i < n`, so the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order
- `b` is either `b + a[1]` or 0
- `c` is either `a[1]` or `2 * a[1]`
- `i` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- The condition `i < n` must still hold true, meaning `n` can be any integer from 1 to 100 (since `i` starts from 1, it can increment up to `n-1`).

Since no changes are required for `a`, `b`, and `c` for the loop to execute one more time, we only need to adjust the state of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is either `b + a[1]` or 0, `c` is either `a[1]` or `2 * a[1]`, `i` is 2**
