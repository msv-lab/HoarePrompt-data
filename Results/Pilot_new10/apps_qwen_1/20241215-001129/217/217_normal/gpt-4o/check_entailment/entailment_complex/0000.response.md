Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. According to the problem, you can partition the sequence into any two subsequences `b` and `c`, and maximize the value of `B - C`, where `B` is the sum of elements in `b` and `C` is the sum of elements in `c`. However, the current implementation only considers partitioning the sequence into positive and negative numbers. This approach does not account for all possible partitions, and therefore does not guarantee finding the maximum possible value of `B - C`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3
1 -2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

Because we can partition the sequence into `b = [1, 3]` and `c = [-2]`. Here, `B = 1 + 3 = 4` and `C = -2`, so `B - C = 4 - (-2) = 6`. However, the current program would compute `B = 1 + 3 = 4` and `C = -2`, resulting in `B - C = 4 - (-2) = 6`, but it only considers the positive and negative numbers separately without exploring other possible partitions.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirement of considering all possible partitions of the sequence, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
