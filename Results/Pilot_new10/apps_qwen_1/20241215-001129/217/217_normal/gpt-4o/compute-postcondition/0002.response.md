The code calculates the sum of all positive integers in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `B`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the list `a` is not altered; only a new variable `B` is created.

- `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
- `B` is the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`.**
