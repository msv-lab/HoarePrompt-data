The code calculates the sum of all negative integers in the list `a` and assigns this sum to `C`. The sum of all positive integers in the list `a` is represented by `B`. The value of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Let's break down the changes:
- `C` is assigned the sum of all negative integers in `a`. This means `C` will be a specific value based on the negative integers in `a`.

The output state will include the updated value of `C` and the unchanged values of `n` and `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`; `C` is the sum of all negative integers in the list `a`.**
