The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle the constraints where `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5).

Functionality: **The function handles the constraints for the integers n, m, r, and k such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5).**
