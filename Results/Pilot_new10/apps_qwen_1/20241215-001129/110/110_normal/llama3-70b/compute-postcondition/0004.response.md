Let's analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parameters and Constraints**:
   - The function takes four integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` as input.
   - The constraints are: \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\), \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), and \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n \times m, 10^5)\).

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The function reads the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` from input.
   - It then calculates `ans` as the minimum of `k` and \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\).
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans / ((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1))`.

3. **Postconditions**:
   - The return postconditions state that the function handles the given constraints and performs the calculation as described.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:

- **Edge Case 1**: If \(r\) is very close to either \(n\) or \(m\), the expression \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\) can be small, leading to a large value for \(\frac{ans}{(n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)}\). This should be considered in the functionality.
- **Edge Case 2**: If \(k = \min(n \times m, 10^5)\), the value of `ans` will be \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\), and the printed value will be 1.0.
- **Edge Case 3**: If \(k < (n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\), the value of `ans` will be `k`, and the printed value will be \(\frac{k}{(n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)}\).

### Summary:

The function `func` reads four integers \(n\), \(m\), \(r\), and \(k\) from input and ensures they meet specific constraints. It calculates `ans` as the minimum of `k` and \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\). The function then prints the ratio of `ans` to \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\). This ratio can vary depending on the values of \(n\), \(m\), \(r\), and \(k\).

### Functionality:
**The function reads four integers \(n\), \(m\), \(r\), and \(k\) from input, ensuring they meet the specified constraints. It calculates the minimum of \(k\) and \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\), and prints the ratio of this minimum to \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\).**
