Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The code calculates the minimum of \(k\) and \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\), and then prints the ratio of this minimum to \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\). However, this approach does not maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

To maximize the expected number of caught fishes, the optimal strategy is to place the \(k\) fishes in such a way that they cover as many positions of the scoop-net as possible. Specifically, each fish should ideally be placed in a cell that is covered by the maximum number of possible scoop-net positions.

For a given cell \((x, y)\), the number of positions the scoop-net can cover is \((n - r + 1 - x + 1) \times (m - r + 1 - y + 1)\). To maximize the expected value, we need to sum the contributions of each cell and divide by the total number of possible positions.

The code does not implement this logic. Instead, it simply takes the minimum of \(k\) and the number of possible positions and divides by the number of possible positions, which does not necessarily maximize the expected value.

Here is an example to illustrate the discrepancy:

### Example Input
```
3 3 2 3
```

### Expected Output
```
2.6666666667
```

### Actual Output of Provided Code
```
2.0000000000
```

The provided code does not account for the optimal placement of the fishes, leading to a suboptimal expected value.
