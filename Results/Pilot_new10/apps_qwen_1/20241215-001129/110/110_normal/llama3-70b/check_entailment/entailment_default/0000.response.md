Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not solve the problem as described. The code calculates the minimum of \(k\) and \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\), and then divides this minimum by \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\). This calculation does not maximize the expected number of caught fishes. Instead, the correct approach involves placing the fishes in such a way that each possible position of the scoop-net captures as many fishes as possible on average.

To achieve the highest expected value, the optimal strategy is to place the fishes in the cells such that each scoop-net position has an equal chance of catching the maximum number of fishes. One effective way to do this is to distribute the fishes uniformly across the pond, ensuring that no matter where the scoop-net is placed, the expected number of caught fishes is maximized.

The given solution does not consider the placement strategy and simply returns a value that does not represent the expected number of caught fishes. Therefore, the code is incorrect for every potential case.
