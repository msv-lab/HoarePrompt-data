Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not seem to place the fishes in a manner that maximizes the expected number of caught fishes. Instead, it uses a heuristic approach by placing the fishes based on the coverage value, which is calculated by the `coverage` function. However, this approach does not guarantee that the maximum expected number of caught fishes is achieved.

To maximize the expected number of caught fishes, the optimal strategy would be to place the fishes in such a way that they are uniformly distributed across the grid, ensuring that each possible position of the scoop-net has an equal chance of catching the maximum number of fishes. The current implementation does not ensure this uniform distribution.

For instance, consider the example provided:

- Input: `3 3 2 3`
- Expected Output: `2.0000000000`

The correct placement of fishes would be to place them in such a way that no matter where the scoop-net is placed, the number of fishes caught is always 2. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this uniformity.

A correct approach would involve calculating the optimal positions for the fishes to ensure that the expected value is maximized, which may require a different algorithmic approach. Therefore, the given code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
