Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly calculate the coverage for each cell in the pond. The function `coverage(x, y)` uses a formula that does not accurately represent the number of cells that would be caught if the scoop-net were placed at position `(x, y)`. Specifically, the formula used in `coverage(x, y)` is not consistent with the problem description and the intended solution.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that the `coverage` function calculates the number of cells that would be caught if the scoop-net were placed at position `(x, y)`. The correct formula should be:

\[ \text{coverage}(x, y) = \min(x + r - 1, n) - \max(x - 1, 0) + 1 \times \min(y + r - 1, m) - \max(y - 1, 0) + 1 \]

However, the current implementation uses a different formula that does not accurately reflect the coverage area. This discrepancy means that the expected number of caught fishes calculated by the main function `func_1` is incorrect.

For example, consider a pond of size \(3 \times 3\) with \(r = 2\). If we place the scoop-net at position \((2, 2)\), the correct coverage should be 4 (the entire \(2 \times 2\) subgrid), but the current implementation calculates a different value, leading to an incorrect expected number of caught fishes.
