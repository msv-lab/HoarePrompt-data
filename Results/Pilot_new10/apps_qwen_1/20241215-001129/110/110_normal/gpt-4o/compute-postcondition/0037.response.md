The code initializes `total_positions` to the value of `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `total_positions`.

Output State: **`k` is 0, `total_coverage` is the sum of all `-coverage(x, y)` values popped from the heap, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), `heap` is an empty list, `cov` is the last `-coverage(x, y)` value popped from the heap, `x` is the last `x` coordinate popped from the heap, `y` is the last `y` coordinate popped from the heap, `total_positions` is \((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)\).**
