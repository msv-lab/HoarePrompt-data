Output State: **`y` is equal to `m`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `r` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), `k` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n*m, 10^5)\), `heap` is a list containing \(2m\) elements, each of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, and `x` is the final value of `x_end + 1` after all iterations.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Initially, `y` starts from 0, and the loop runs for each value of `y` from 0 to `m-1`.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration of the loop, a new element `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` is pushed into the heap, where `x` is updated to `x_end + 1` after the previous iteration.
3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `y` will be equal to `m` because the loop runs for each value of `y` from 0 to `m-1`.
   - The heap will contain exactly `2m` elements, each of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`. The value of `x` will be the final value of `x_end + 1` after all iterations.
4. **Conditions**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `m` is at least 1.
   - `r` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\).
   - `k` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n*m, 10^5)\).

Since the loop ensures that each element `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` is added to the heap for every `y` from 0 to `m-1`, and considering the constraints on `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, the final state of the variables can be summarized as stated above.
