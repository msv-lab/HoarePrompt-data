Output State: **`k` is 0, `total_coverage` is the sum of all `-coverage(x, y)` values popped from the heap, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), `heap` is an empty list, `cov` is the last `-coverage(x, y)` value popped from the heap, `x` is the last `x` coordinate popped from the heap, `y` is the last `y` coordinate popped from the heap.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `k` iterations, popping elements from the heap and decrementing `total_coverage` by the `-coverage(x, y)` value each time.
- After `k` iterations, `k` becomes 0.
- `total_coverage` will be the cumulative sum of all `-coverage(x, y)` values that were popped from the heap.
- Since the loop pops elements from the heap `k` times, the heap will be empty after all iterations.
- The values of `cov`, `x`, and `y` will be the last elements popped from the heap, as the loop continues until `k` reaches 0.
