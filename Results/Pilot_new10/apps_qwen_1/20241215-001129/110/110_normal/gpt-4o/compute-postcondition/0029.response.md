`total_coverage` is decremented by `cov`. The value of `cov` is equal to `-coverage(x, y)`. Since the actual value of `coverage(x, y)` is not specified, we will keep it in its symbolic form. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_coverage` is 0 minus `-coverage(x, y)`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), `k` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n*m, 10^5)\), `heap` is a list containing \(nm\) elements with one element removed, `cov` is equal to `-coverage(x, y)`, `x` is the coordinate along `n`, `y` is the coordinate along `m`.**
