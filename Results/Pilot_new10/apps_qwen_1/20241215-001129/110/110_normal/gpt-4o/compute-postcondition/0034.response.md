The code `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns its elements to `cov`, `x`, and `y`. Given the initial state, `cov` is set to the first element of the tuple popped from `heap`, `x` is the second element, and `y` is the third element. The values of `total_coverage`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `r`, and `heap` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is `k - 1`, `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - 2 * cov`, `cov` is the first element of the next tuple popped from `heap`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple popped from `heap`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple popped from `heap`, `total_coverage`, `n`, `m`, `r`, and `heap` remain unchanged.**
