The code `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops and returns the smallest element from the heap, which is a tuple of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. This means that `cov` is assigned the value `-coverage(x, y)`, and `x` and `y` are assigned the corresponding coordinates.

Since the heap is a list of tuples containing `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, the smallest element in terms of the first element of the tuple (which is negative coverage) is popped off the heap. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`total_coverage` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), `k` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n*m, 10^5)\), `heap` is a list containing \(nm\) elements with one element removed, `cov` is equal to `-coverage(x, y)` for some coordinates `(x, y)`, `x` is the coordinate along `n`, `y` is the coordinate along `m`.**
