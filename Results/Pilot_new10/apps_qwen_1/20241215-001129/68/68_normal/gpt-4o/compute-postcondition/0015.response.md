Let's analyze the given annotated code step by step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads three non-negative integers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) from standard input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`.
   - These integers are then assigned to variables \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `min_upvotes` to \( x \).
   - It sets `max_upvotes` to \( x + z \).
   - It initializes `min_downvotes` to \( y \).
   - It sets `max_downvotes` to \( y + z \).

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The function checks if `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`.
     - If true, it prints `-`.
     - If false, it enters another conditional check.
       - It checks if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`.
         - If true, it prints `+`.
         - If false, it prints `?`.

4. **Final State**:
   - Regardless of the outcome of the inner if-else block, the function always prints either `-`, `+`, or `?`.

Given the return postconditions and the code analysis, let's summarize the functionality:

The function reads three non-negative integers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) from standard input. It then calculates the minimum possible upvotes (`min_upvotes`) and maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`), and similarly for downvotes (`min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes`). Based on the comparison of these values, the function prints one of three characters: `-`, `+`, or `?`.

Functionality: **The function reads three non-negative integers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) and prints `-` if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, `+` if the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, and `?` otherwise.**
