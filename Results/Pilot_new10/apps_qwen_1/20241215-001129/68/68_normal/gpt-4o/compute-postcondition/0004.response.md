The code assigns the value of `y + z` to `max_downvotes`. The previous value of `max_downvotes` was `x + z`, so now `max_downvotes` is updated to `y + z`. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `z`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`**
