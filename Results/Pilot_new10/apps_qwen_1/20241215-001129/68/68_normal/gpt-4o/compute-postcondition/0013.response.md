Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`. The output contains `-` regardless of whether `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` or `max_upvotes >= min_downvotes`.***
