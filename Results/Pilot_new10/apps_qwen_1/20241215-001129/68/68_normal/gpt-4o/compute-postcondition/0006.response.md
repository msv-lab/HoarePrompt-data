The code `print('-')` simply prints a hyphen. This operation does not change any of the variables' values or add any new conditions. The only thing affected is the output which will contain the hyphen, but this does not alter the state of the variables.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, the output contains `-`**
