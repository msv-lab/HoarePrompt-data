Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to handle the cases where the result is uncertain. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Uncertainty:**
   - The program checks if `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` and prints `-` if true. Similarly, it checks if `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` and prints `+` if true.
   - However, if neither of these conditions is met, the program prints `?`. According to the problem statement, this should be printed only when the result is uncertain, i.e., when there are more than one possible outcomes based on the votes of the unknown voters (`z`).

2. **Example with Uncertain Result:**
   - Consider the case where `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`. Here, if the single unknown voter upvotes, the result will be `+`, and if the single unknown voter downvotes, the result will be `-`. Therefore, the result is uncertain.
   - The correct output for this case should be `?`, but the current program will incorrectly print `+` because `max_downvotes >= min_upvotes`.

3. **Correct Logic for Uncertainty:**
   - The correct logic should be to check if both `max_upvotes >= min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes >= min_upvotes`. If either condition is true, the result is certain, and the appropriate symbol is printed. If both conditions are true, the result is uncertain, and `?` should be printed.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    
    if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
        print('-')
    elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
        print('+')
    else:
        print('?')

# State of the program after the if-else block has been executed:
# * `x` is an integer between 0 and 100,
# * `y` is an integer between 0 and 100,
# * `z` is an integer between 0 and 100,
# * `max_upvotes` is `x + z`,
# * `min_downvotes` is `y`,
# * `max_downvotes` is `y + z`.
# The output contains `-` if `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, `+` if `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, and `?` if both conditions are false (uncertain).
```

With this corrected logic, the program will correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description.
