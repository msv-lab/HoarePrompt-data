Final: True

Reason: The original assessment was accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program correctly handles all possible cases. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` to account for the minimum and maximum possible number of upvotes considering the unknown votes (`z`). Similarly, it initializes `min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes` for downvotes.

2. **Comparison**:
   - If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, it prints `-` indicating more downvotes than upvotes in all scenarios.
   - If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, it prints `+` indicating more upvotes than downvotes in all scenarios.
   - Otherwise, it prints `?` indicating the result is uncertain because there are at least two possible outcomes based on how the `z` unknown votes are distributed.

The annotated version confirms that the program handles all conditions accurately and matches the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
