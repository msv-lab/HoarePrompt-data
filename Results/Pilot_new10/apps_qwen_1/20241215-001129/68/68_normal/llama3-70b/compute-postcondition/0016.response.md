Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers in the range 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` remains less than or equal to `y + z` and `x` is unchanged. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, then either `x` and `y` remain equal (if `z` is 0) or `x` remains unchanged (if `z` is not 0). In both cases, `x` remains within its initial range and satisfies the condition `x <= y + z`.***
