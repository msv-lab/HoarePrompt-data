The code `print('-')` prints a hyphen to the console but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers in the range 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, with x less than y and x still less than or equal to y + z.**
