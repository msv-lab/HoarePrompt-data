Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, then `x` remains greater than the sum of `y` and `z`. Otherwise, `x` remains less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` do not change beyond their initial ranges.***
