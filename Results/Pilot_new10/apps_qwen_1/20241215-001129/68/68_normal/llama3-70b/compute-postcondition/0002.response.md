The code `print('+')` does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. It simply prints the character '+' to the console. Since no variables are assigned new values or modified, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`; `y` is an integer in the range 0 <= y <= 100; `z` is an integer in the range 0 <= z <= 100**
