The code `print('?')` does not affect the values of any variables. It only prints a question mark to the console. Since the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are unchanged, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers in the range 0 <= x, y <= 100, with x initially greater than or equal to y, and now x is equal to y, `z` is not equal to 0**
