The function does not accept any parameters but expects three non-negative integers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) within the range 0 to 100 from user input. It prints '+' if \( x \) is greater than the sum of \( y \) and \( z \); it prints '-' if \( x \) is less than \( y \); it prints '0' if \( x \) equals \( y \) and \( z \) is 0; it prints '?' if \( x \) equals \( y \) and \( z \) is not 0; and it prints '?' if \( x \) is greater than or equal to \( y \) but not necessarily greater than the sum of \( y \) and \( z \).
