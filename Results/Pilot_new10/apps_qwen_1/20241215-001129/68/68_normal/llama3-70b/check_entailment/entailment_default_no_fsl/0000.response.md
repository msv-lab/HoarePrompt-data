Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided code has a logical flaw in handling the case where \( x \geq y \) but not necessarily greater than \( y + z \). Specifically, the code prints '?' in this case, which is incorrect according to the problem description. 

For example, consider the input (3, 2, 2):
- Here, \( x = 3 \), \( y = 2 \), and \( z = 2 \).
- According to the problem description, if \( x \geq y \), we need to check if it is strictly greater than \( y + z \) or not.
- In this case, \( x = 3 \) is not strictly greater than \( y + z = 4 \), but the code incorrectly prints '?' instead of checking further.

To fix this, the code should check if \( x \geq y \) and then verify if it is strictly greater than \( y + z \) or not. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:  # x >= y
        print('+')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
