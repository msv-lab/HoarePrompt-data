Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a few issues that make it incorrect for every potential case:

1. The code does not handle the case where \( x \) is greater than or equal to \( y + z \) correctly. Specifically, it should check if \( x \) is strictly greater than \( y + z \) to ensure that even with all unknown votes, \( x \) remains greater than \( y \). Instead, it checks if \( x \) is greater than \( y + z \), which can lead to incorrect results if the unknown votes are distributed in a way that balances out the difference between \( x \) and \( y \).

2. The code does not handle the case where \( x \) is less than or equal to \( y + z \) and \( x \) is equal to \( y \) correctly. When \( x = y \) and \( z \neq 0 \), the result should be uncertain because the outcome depends on how the unknown votes are distributed.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

- Input: `5 4 3`
- Expected Output: `?`
- Actual Output: `+`

In this case, \( x = 5 \), \( y = 4 \), and \( z = 3 \). If all unknown votes go to upvotes, the result would be `+`. If all unknown votes go to downvotes, the result would be `-`. Therefore, the result is uncertain.

To fix the code, you need to adjust the conditions to properly handle these cases. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')

func()
```

This version ensures that the code handles all potential cases correctly.
