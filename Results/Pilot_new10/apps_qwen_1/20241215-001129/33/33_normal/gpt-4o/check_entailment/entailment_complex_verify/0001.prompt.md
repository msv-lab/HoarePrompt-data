You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
    if position != 0:
        valid = False
    if valid:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that Limak can only move South if he is on the North Pole and can only move North if he is on the South Pole. Here is a case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
20000 South
10 East
20000 North
```

According to the problem description:
- Limak starts at the North Pole.
- He moves 20000 kilometers South, reaching the South Pole.
- He then moves 10 kilometers East (which does not change his latitude).
- Finally, he tries to move 20000 kilometers North from the South Pole, which is allowed.
- However, the program incorrectly allows this movement, resulting in Limak ending up at the North Pole, even though he moved 10 kilometers East during the journey.

The program does not enforce the restriction that Limak can only move North if he is on the South Pole after the initial South movement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. For each i from 1 to n, t_{i} is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, and dir_{i} is one of "North", "South", "West", "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 inclusive, `valid` is `True`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `dir` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East"
    if (position != 0) :
        valid = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer, `position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 inclusive, `valid` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `dir` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East". This is because if `position` is not equal to 0, then `valid` is set to False, regardless of the value of `n`. If `position` is 0, there is no change to the variables as there is no else part in the code.
    if valid :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 inclusive, `valid` is either True or False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `dir` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East". If `valid` is True, the console prints 'YES'. If `valid` is False, the console prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of movements defined by distances `t_i` and directions (`North`, `South`, `West`, `East`) for `n` steps, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6`. It checks if the final position of the movement sequence is exactly at position 0. If the final position is not 0, the function sets `valid` to `False`. The function then prints 'YES' if `valid` is `True` (indicating the final position is 0), and 'NO' otherwise. Edge cases include invalid movements (e.g., moving North when the position is already 0, moving South when the position is already 20000).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
