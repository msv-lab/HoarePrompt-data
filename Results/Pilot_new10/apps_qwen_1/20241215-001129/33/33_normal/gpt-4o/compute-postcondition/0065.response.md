The print statement does not affect any variable values; it only outputs text to the console. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 inclusive, `valid` is True, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `dir` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East". We printed 'YES' to the console.**
