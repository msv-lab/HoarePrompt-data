Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 inclusive, `valid` is `True`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `dir` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East"**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it updates the `position` based on the direction (`dir`) and the value of `t`.
- If any condition fails (e.g., `position` going out of bounds, `dir` being invalid for the current position), `valid` becomes `False`, and the loop breaks early.
- After the loop completes, `position` will be within the range [0, 20000] and `valid` will remain `True` if no conditions were violated during the loop.

Since the loop runs for all `n` iterations, and given the constraints and checks, the final state of the variables will be as described above.
