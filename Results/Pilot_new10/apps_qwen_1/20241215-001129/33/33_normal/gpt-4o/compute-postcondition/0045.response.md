`t` and `dir` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string using `split()`. The values of `n`, `position`, `valid`, and `t` (the first part of the split input) are updated. The value of `dir` (the second part of the split input) is also updated. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is `False`, `t` is the first part of the input string after splitting, `dir` is the second part of the input string after splitting**
