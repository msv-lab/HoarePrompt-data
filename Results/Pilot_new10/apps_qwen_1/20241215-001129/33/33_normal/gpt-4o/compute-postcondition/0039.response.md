Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1; `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000; `valid` is `False`; `t` is an integer; `dir` is the other part of the input string. Since the if condition is `position == 0 or position == 20000`, the `valid` variable remains `False` in both cases as there is no operation changing its value inside the if or else blocks.***
