`t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the first part of the input string into an integer. The original values of `position`, `valid`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is `False`, `t` is now an integer (the converted value of the first part of the input string), `dir` is the second part of the input string after splitting.
