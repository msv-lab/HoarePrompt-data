`t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the input string `t` into an integer. The value of `t` is now an integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000; `valid` is `False`; `t` is an integer; `dir` is the other part of the input string**
