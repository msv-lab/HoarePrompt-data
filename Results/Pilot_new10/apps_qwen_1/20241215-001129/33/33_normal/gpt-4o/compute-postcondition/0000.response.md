`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can range from 1 to 50, but its exact value is now determined by user input. The values of `t_i` and `dir_i` for each `i` from 1 to `n` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and for each i from 1 to n, `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6, and `dir_i` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East".`**
