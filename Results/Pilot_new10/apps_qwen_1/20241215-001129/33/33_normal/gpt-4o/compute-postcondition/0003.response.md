State before the loop starts: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, for each i from 1 to n, `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6, and `dir_i` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East"; `position` is 0; `valid` is `True`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because the loop runs for each `_` in the range of `n`.
2. Since `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect this.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` should be at least 1.

Considering the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be at least 1.
- `position` remains 0.
- `valid` remains `True`.

So, the final state after adjustment would be:

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `position` is 0, `valid` is `True`**
