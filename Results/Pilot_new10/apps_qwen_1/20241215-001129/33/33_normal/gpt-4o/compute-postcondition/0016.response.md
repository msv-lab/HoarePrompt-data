`position` is incremented by `t`. The value of `t` is an integer, so `position` becomes its current value plus `t`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1, `position` is updated to its original value plus `t`, `valid` is `True`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is 'South'.
Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `position` is updated to its original value plus `t`, `valid` is `True`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is 'South'**
