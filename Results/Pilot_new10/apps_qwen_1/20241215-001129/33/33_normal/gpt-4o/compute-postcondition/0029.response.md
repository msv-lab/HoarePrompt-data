`t` and `dir` are assigned the values from the input split by a space. The input can be any string that is split into two parts. The variable `position` remains unchanged, and `valid` remains `False`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1; `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000; `valid` is `False`; `t` is a part of the input string; `dir` is the other part of the input string.
