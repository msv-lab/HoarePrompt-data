Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 inclusive, `valid` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `dir` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East". This is because if `position` is not equal to 0, then `valid` is set to False, regardless of the value of `n`. If `position` is 0, there is no change to the variables as there is no else part in the code.***
