Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `position` is updated based on the value of `dir`: if `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to its original value plus `t`, and `valid` remains `True`. If `dir` is 'North', `position` is less than 0, `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', `position` is either 0 or 20000, and `valid` is `False`. `t` is an integer, and `dir` is not 'North'. The current value of `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, and `valid` is `False`.***
