The function processes a series of movements defined by integers and direction strings, where the latitude changes based on the movement direction and distance. It checks if the final latitude is exactly 90째 North or not, and prints 'YES' if the latitude is 90째 North, and 'NO' if it is not, considering potential edge cases like exceeding the latitude limits (-90째 to 90째) or invalid directions.
