According to the code, the loop will execute for \(n\) iterations, where \(1 \leq n \leq 50\). The loop will iterate over each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), and within each iteration, the values of `t_i` and `dir_i` will be used. The initial value of `curr_lat` is 90.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the following:
- The variable `n` must be within the specified range (i.e., \(1 \leq n \leq 50\)).
- For each iteration \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), the values of `t_i` and `dir_i` must be defined.
- The variable `curr_lat` is initialized to 90 and will be updated within the loop, but its initial value does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
- For each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), `t_i` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\).
- For each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), `dir_i` must be one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East".

State: **`n` is an integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 50\), for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), `t_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\), and `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East"**
