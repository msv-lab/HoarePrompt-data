`t` and `dir` are assigned the values from the input split by a space. The input is a string that is split into two parts, which are assigned to `t` and `dir` respectively. The values of `curr_lat`, `n`, and `t` being an integer remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `t` is the first part of the input, and `dir` is the second part of the input.**
