The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified, the variables `curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string**
