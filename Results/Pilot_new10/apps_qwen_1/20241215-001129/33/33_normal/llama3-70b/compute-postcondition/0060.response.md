Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `t_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\), `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East". If `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir_i` is not "South" at any point, 'NO' is printed to the console. Similarly, if `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir_i` is not "North" at any point, 'NO' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the final value of `curr_lat` is the result of the cumulative effect of all valid movements (North or South) within the specified range.**
