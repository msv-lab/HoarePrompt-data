The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This operation does not affect any variable values. The initial conditions for `curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, `dir`, and the program exiting remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and the program exits. The console prints 'NO'**
