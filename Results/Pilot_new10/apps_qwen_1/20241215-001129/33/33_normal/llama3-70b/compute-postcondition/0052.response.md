The `exit()` function call does not modify any variables but instead terminates the program. Since no changes are made to the variables `curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, or `dir`, their previous values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string.**
