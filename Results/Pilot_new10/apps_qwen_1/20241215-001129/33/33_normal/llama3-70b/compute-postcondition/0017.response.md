Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 50\); for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), `t_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\); `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East"; `dir` is the second value of the split string; `t` is the integer value of the second part of the split string; `curr_lat` is updated as follows: if `dir` is "North", `curr_lat` is increased by the sum of `t_i / 111.195` for each `t_i` from 1 to \(n\). If `dir` is "South", `curr_lat` is decreased by the sum of `t_i / 111.195` for each `t_i` from 1 to \(n\). If `dir` is either "West" or "East", `curr_lat` remains unchanged. The current value of `curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\).***

Explanation:
- If the condition `curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90` is true, the program exits, ensuring that `curr_lat` is within the valid range \([-90, 90]\).
- If the condition is false, the `curr_lat` is updated according to the direction `dir` and the values of `t_i` as described in the precondition, and `curr_lat` remains within the range \([-90, 90]\) after the update.
