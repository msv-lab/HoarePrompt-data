According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\).
- If `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not "South", the function does nothing.
- If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not "North", the program terminates without changing `curr_lat`.
- In all other cases, the program continues execution without modifying `curr_lat`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `curr_lat` remains within the range \([-90, 90]\).
- `dir` does not affect the continuation of the loop since the loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` must be greater than 0**
