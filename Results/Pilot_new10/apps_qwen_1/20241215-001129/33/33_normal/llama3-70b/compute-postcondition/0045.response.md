`t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the string `t` to an integer. The values of `curr_lat`, `n`, `t` (now an integer), `dir`, and the conditions they satisfy remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `t` is the first part of the input, and `dir` is the second part of the input, and `t` is now converted to an integer.**
