The code updates the value of `curr_lat` by adding `t / 111.195`, where `t` is an integer from the list `t_i`. Since `t` can be any value between 1 and \(10^6\), and given that `curr_lat` is updated by dividing `t` by 111.195, the exact value of `curr_lat` cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `t`. However, we know that the update operation is performed for each `t_i` from 1 to `n`.

The precondition states that `dir` is currently set to "North". This value does not change with the given code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 50\); for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), `t_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\); `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East"; `t` is the integer value of the second part of the split string; `dir` is the second value of the split string (which remains "North"); `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` for each `t_i` from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 50\); for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), `t_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\); `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East"; `t` is the integer value of the second part of the split string; `dir` is "North"; `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` for each `t_i` from 1 to `n`.**
