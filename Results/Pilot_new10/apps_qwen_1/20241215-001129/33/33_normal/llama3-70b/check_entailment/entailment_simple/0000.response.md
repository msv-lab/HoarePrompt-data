Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Movement Calculation**: The program calculates latitude changes using the factor `111.195`, which is incorrect. According to the problem statement, the circumference of the Earth is 40,000 km, so moving 1 km south or north should change the latitude by approximately `1/111.195` degrees (since the circumference divided by 360 degrees gives the length per degree of latitude). However, the program incorrectly uses this factor. The correct factor should be `1/111.195`.

2. **Pole Constraints**: The program checks if `curr_lat` goes out of the range [-90, 90], but it does not correctly enforce the constraints at the poles. Specifically:
   - If Limak is at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`), he can only move South.
   - If Limak is at the South Pole (`curr_lat == -90`), he can only move North.
   
   The program correctly enforces these constraints, but the calculation of latitude change is incorrect due to the use of `111.195`.

3. **Ending Condition**: The program checks if the final latitude is 90 (North Pole) to determine if the journey ends correctly. However, since the movement calculation is incorrect, this condition may not always be accurate.

To fix the program, the latitude calculation should use the correct factor, and the program should ensure that the final latitude is exactly 90 (North Pole) after all movements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
    
    print('YES' if abs(curr_lat - 90) < 1e-9 else 'NO')
```

With these corrections, the program will accurately reflect the problem description and handle all cases correctly.
