Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program correctly implements the constraints for moving from the North Pole or the South Pole. The program ensures that:
1. If Limak is at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`), the movement direction must be "South".
2. If Limak is at the South Pole (`curr_lat == -90`), the movement direction must be "North".
3. The journey ends on the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`).

The original assessment incorrectly stated that the program does not correctly implement these constraints. However, the annotated version clearly shows that the program checks these conditions properly and exits with "NO" if any of these constraints are violated. Therefore, the original assessment was not accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
