Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the constraints for moving from the North Pole or the South Pole. Specifically, it allows movements other than "South" when at the North Pole and other than "North" when at the South Pole, which violates the problem description. For example, consider the following input:

```
2
20000 South
10000 East
```

According to the problem description, after moving 20000 kilometers South from the North Pole, Limak should be at the South Pole. However, the program allows him to move 10000 kilometers East from the South Pole, which is not allowed since he cannot move East or West from the South Pole. This input should result in "NO", but the program does not handle this case correctly.
