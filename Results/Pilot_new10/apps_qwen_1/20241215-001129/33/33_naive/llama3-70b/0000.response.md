Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Pole Movement Conditions**: The program ensures that if Limak is at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`), he can only move South, and if he is at the South Pole (`curr_lat == -90`), he can only move North. This is enforced by checking the current latitude before moving and ensuring the direction is valid.

2. **Ending Condition**: The program checks whether Limak ends at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`) after completing all movements. If not, it prints "NO".

3. **Latitude Constraints**: The program ensures that Limak’s latitude remains within the valid range [-90, 90] degrees.

Given these checks, the program correctly handles all potential cases described in the problem statement. There are no scenarios where the program fails to meet the conditions specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
