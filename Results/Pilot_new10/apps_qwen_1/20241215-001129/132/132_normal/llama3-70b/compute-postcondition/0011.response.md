The code `print('No')` prints the string 'No' but does not change the values of the variables `n`, `x`, `y`. The precondition remains intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, sorted in ascending order; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, containing integers entered by the user and sorted in ascending order; the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`; `x` is not equal to `y`; the output is 'No'**
