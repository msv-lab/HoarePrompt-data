Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, containing integers entered by the user. If the sum of elements in `x` is not equal to the sum of elements in `y`, the output is 'No'. Otherwise, `x` and `y` are both sorted in ascending order and their sums are equal. If `x` equals `y`, the output is 'Yes'; otherwise, the output is 'No'.***
