`total_x` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `x`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the list `y` remains the same as the initial state. The variable `total_x` is now the sum of the elements in `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `y` is a list of `n` integers (new values); `total_x` is the sum of all elements in the list `x`**
