Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program only checks if the total number of stones in the second configuration is greater than the total number of stones in the first configuration. However, this check is insufficient to ensure the records can be consistent. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program does not handle the scenario where stones might be moved between piles, which could result in the same total number of stones but a different distribution. Therefore, the program cannot correctly determine if the records are consistent based solely on the total number of stones.
