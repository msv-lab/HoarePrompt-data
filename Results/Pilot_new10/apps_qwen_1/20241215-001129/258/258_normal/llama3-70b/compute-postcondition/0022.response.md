The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values in the list `times`, the sorting operation will reorder the elements within the list. However, the specific values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is -999, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers, `ans` is the minimum between its original value and `func_2(x, y, x, y)`**
