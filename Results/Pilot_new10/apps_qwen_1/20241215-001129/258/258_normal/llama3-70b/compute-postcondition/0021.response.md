Output State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is -999, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers, `ans` is the minimum between its original value and `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.**

Note: The actual values of `times` depend on the implementation of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, which is not provided. Therefore, we can only state that `times` is updated to the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.
