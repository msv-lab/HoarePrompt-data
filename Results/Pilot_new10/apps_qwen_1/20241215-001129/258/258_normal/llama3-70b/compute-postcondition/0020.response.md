According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1001, inclusive.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
- `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000.
- `y` is 1000.
- `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers.
- `ans` is the minimum between its original value and `times[K - 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be within the range of -1000 to 1001. Since `y` was 1000 in the previous iteration, the next value `y` can take is -999 (the first value in the range).

Thus, we need to adjust the state such that `y` is -999.

State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is -999, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers, `ans` is the minimum between its original value and `times[K - 1]`**
