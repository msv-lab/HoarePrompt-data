The code updates the `times` variable by assigning it the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. Since `x` is initially `initial_x + 1999` and `y` is `-1000`, the function call `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is made with these values. The previous value of `times` was a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -1000, initial_x + 1999, -1000)`, but now `times` is updated to the new list returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact contents of the new `times` list. However, we know that `times` is now a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, where `x = initial_x + 1999` and `y = -1000`.

The `ans` variable, which was previously the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations, is not directly affected by this assignment, so its value remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-1000`, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -1000, initial_x + 1999, -1000)`, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged.**
