The `times.sort()` method sorts the list `times` in ascending order. Since the initial value of `times` is the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, and without knowing the exact implementation of `func_2`, we can only say that `times` is a list containing two elements, both of which are results of calling `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000
- `y` is -998
- `times` is the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`
- `ans` is the minimum between its original value and `times[0]`

After executing `times.sort()`, the list `times` will be sorted, and `times[0]` will be the smallest element in the list. However, since the actual values of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` are not known, we cannot specify the exact values of `times` or `times[0]`. But we can say that `times` is now a sorted list, and `ans` remains the same as its original value because sorting does not affect the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is -998, `times` is a sorted list (original value of `times`), `ans` is the minimum between its original value and `times[0]`**
