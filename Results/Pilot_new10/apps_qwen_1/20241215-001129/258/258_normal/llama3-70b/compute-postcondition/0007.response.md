The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` calls the function `func_2` with arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, `y`. The function returns a sorted list of up to four integers, which is assigned to the variable `times`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000, `ans` is `times[K - 1]` if `times[K - 1]` is less than positive infinity, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`**
