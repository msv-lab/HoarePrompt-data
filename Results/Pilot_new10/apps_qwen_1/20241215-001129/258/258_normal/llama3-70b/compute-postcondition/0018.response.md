The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times`. The initial state is that `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000, and `times` is a list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. After sorting, the list `times` will contain its elements in ascending order.

Since the exact values of the elements in `times` are not specified, we can only state that `times` will be sorted. The output state remains that `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000, and `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers originally returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers**
