Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000.
   - `y` is 1000.
   - `ans` is the minimum value obtained from `times[K - 1]` across all iterations.
   - `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each iteration.
   - `x` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

2. **For Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `y` in the range `-1000` to `1001`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `y` must take on each value from `-1000` to `1001`.
   - The initial value of `y` is 1000, which is within the range of `-1000` to `1001`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `y` starts at 1000 and the loop will run for every value from `-1000` to `1001`, we need to ensure that `y` takes on these values.
   - The state of `x` and `ans` does not directly influence the loop's ability to execute as they are not involved in the loop's condition.

Given the above points, we only need to ensure that `y` starts at 1000 and iterates through all values from `-1000` to `1001`.

**State after adjustment for the loop to execute:**
- `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000 (though its specific value isn't critical for the loop to execute).
- `y` is 1000 and will iterate through all values from `-1000` to `1001`.
- `ans` remains the minimum value obtained from `times[K - 1]` across all iterations.
- `times` remains a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each iteration.

Thus, the final state should be:

**State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000 and will iterate through all values from `-1000` to `1001`, `ans` is the minimum value obtained from `times[K - 1]` across all iterations, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each iteration**.
