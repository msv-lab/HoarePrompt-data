The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in ascending order. The initial state of the variables is as follows:
- `x` is `initial_x + 1999`
- `y` is `-999`
- `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -999, initial_x + 1999, -999)`
- `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged

After sorting, the list `times` will be updated to its sorted version. However, since the original values of `times` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact sorted values. But we know that `times` will be sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-999`, `times` is a sorted list (in ascending order) of up to four integers, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged**
