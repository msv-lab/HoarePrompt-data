According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000 inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000, `ans` is the minimum of `times[2]` and `times[K - 1]`, and `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decreased by 1 from its current value of 1000 to reach the next value in the range, which is 999.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 999, `ans` is the minimum of `times[2]` and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers**.
