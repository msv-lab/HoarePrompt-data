The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` assigns the return value of the function `func_2` with arguments `x, y, x, y` to the variable `times`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact content of the `times` list without knowing what `func_2` does. Therefore, we will represent the updated state with the understanding that `times` now holds the return value of `func_2`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is `initial_x + 1999`
- `y` is `-998`
- `times` is a sorted list (in ascending order) of up to four integers
- `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged

After executing the code, the only change is the assignment of the return value of `func_2` to `times`. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-998`, `times` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged**
