The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `x` (a list of integers), `y` (a list of integers), `X` (a real number), and `Y` (a real number). It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the result of the expression `c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)`, with `x` and `y` being the coordinates of the piece of meat, `c` being the hardness of the piece of meat, and `func_1` being a function that takes `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y` as parameters. The function iterates over a list of meat pieces (each represented as a tuple containing `x`, `y`, and `c`), applies the expression `c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)` to each piece, and collects the results into a list of tuples.
