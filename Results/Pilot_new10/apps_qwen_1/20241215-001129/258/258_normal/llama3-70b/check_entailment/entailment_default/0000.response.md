Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_3` iterates over all integer coordinates \((-1000, 1000)\), which means it checks a total of \(2001^2 = 4004001\) points. While this approach aims to find the optimal coordinates to minimize the cooking time, it is overly simplistic and does not consider continuous real-number coordinates. The problem allows for real-number coordinates, and the given implementation only considers integer coordinates, which might not yield the optimal solution.

For example, if the coordinates of the meats are \((-1.5, 0)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((1.5, 0)\) with hardnesses 1, 1, and 1 respectively, the optimal point would be around \((0, 0)\), but since the code only considers integer points, it might miss the exact optimal point and thus return a suboptimal solution. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
