Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over a discrete grid of points (-1000 to 1000) and calculating the time required for each point. However, this approach is flawed because it only considers integer coordinates and does not account for real number coordinates as specified in the problem description. The output hints confirm that `func_3` iterates over integer coordinates, which means it does not handle real number coordinates as required. Thus, the program does not handle the problem description correctly for every potential case.
