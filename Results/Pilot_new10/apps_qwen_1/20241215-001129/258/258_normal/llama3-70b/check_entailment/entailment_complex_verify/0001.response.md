Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program is still limited to checking only integer coordinates for the heat source position. The function `func_3` iterates over all integer coordinates within the range [-1000, 1000] and calculates the time required for K or more pieces of meat to be ready. However, the problem description specifies that the coordinates for the heat source can be real numbers, not just integers. Therefore, the current implementation will not find the optimal solution for cases where the optimal heat source position is not an integer coordinate. For example, the sample input provided in the problem description suggests that the optimal heat source position is at \((-0.2, 0)\), which is not an integer coordinate. Thus, the program does not fully address the requirements of the problem as stated.
