Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function calculates the Euclidean distance between a specific piece of meat `(x, y)` and the heat source `(X, Y)`. This part is correct.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to calculate the time required to grill each piece of meat when the heat source is placed at coordinates `(X, Y)`.
   - The code inside `func_2` is incorrect. It passes `x` and `y` (which are single integers) instead of iterating over the list of meats. It should pass the full list of coordinates and hardness to `func_1`.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - The function `func_3` iterates over a grid of coordinates `(-1000, 1000)` to find the optimal heat source location. However, the logic of selecting the optimal heat source is flawed.
   - The function assumes that the optimal heat source location is `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are integers. This is a significant limitation because the actual optimal location could be any real number within the given range.
   - The function sorts the times and takes the `K-1` smallest time to decide the optimal heat source, but this approach is incorrect. It does not guarantee finding the minimum time needed to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Use a continuous search method (e.g., a binary search or a grid-based search with finer resolution) to find the optimal heat source location.
2. Ensure that the function `func_2` correctly calculates the time for all pieces of meat for any given `(X, Y)`.
3. Properly sort and select the times to ensure that the optimal heat source minimizes the time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the problem requirements because it incorrectly calculates the optimal heat source location and does not properly handle the continuous nature of the coordinate space. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
