Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_3` iterates over all integer coordinates \((-1000, 1000)\), which means it only considers integer coordinates. However, the problem description specifies that \(X\) and \(Y\) can be any real numbers, not just integers. This means the code will miss potential optimal solutions where \(X\) and \(Y\) are not integers. For example, consider the following input:

```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```

The optimal solution is to place the heat source at approximately \((-0.2, 0)\), but the code will not consider this because it only checks integer coordinates. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
