Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Distance and Time**: The `func_1` function iterates over all pairs of meat pieces and checks if a midpoint between them satisfies the condition for `K` pieces of meat. However, this approach does not guarantee that the chosen midpoint minimizes the time for `K` or more pieces of meat to be ready. The program needs to find the optimal point, not just any feasible point.

2. **Inefficient and Incorrect Logic**: The `func_1` function does not handle the scenario where the optimal point might not lie between any two points but could be at a different location. The current implementation only considers midpoints of pairs, which is insufficient for finding the global optimum.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_2` function performs a binary search, but the logic inside `func_1` does not ensure that the optimal point is being correctly identified. The program should consider all possible points, not just midpoints, to find the minimum time.

The output hints confirm that the functions do not cover all necessary cases and do not correctly determine the optimal point for minimizing the time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is still incorrect.
