Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the input correctly and processes it to form a list of meat tuples `(x, y, c)`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_2` function uses a binary search approach to find the minimum time `T` required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. The search interval is defined as `[0, 1000000000.0]`, and the precision of the search is controlled by the threshold `1e-07`.

3. **Condition Check Function**: The `func_1` function checks whether there exists a position `(X, Y)` such that at least `K` pieces of meat become ready within time `T`. It iterates over all pairs of meat pieces, calculates the midpoint and distance between them, and counts the number of other meat pieces within this calculated distance.

4. **Correct Logic**: The logic implemented in `func_1` ensures that the midpoint and distance calculations correctly reflect the condition that needs to be satisfied. The binary search in `func_2` effectively narrows down the time `T` until the condition is met.

Given these points, the code seems to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent flaws or edge cases that the code does not address. Therefore, the code is correct.
