Postcondition: ***`c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i+2]`, `d` is either `c1 * T - c2 * T` (if `c1 * T < c2 * T`), or `c1 * T - c2 * T` (if `c1 * T >= c2 * T`), `dx` is the same, `dy` is the same, `d2` is the same, `cx` is the same, `cy` is the same, `my` is the same, `count` is the same, and `j` is `i + 2`. If `d < 0`, the value of `d` remains unchanged; otherwise, it also remains unchanged since there is no else part modifying it.***
