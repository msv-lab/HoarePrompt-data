First, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

- `cx` and `cy` are unchanged by this line of code.
- `d` is unchanged by this line of code.
- `dy` is unchanged by this line of code.
- `d2` is unchanged by this line of code.
- `dx` is unchanged by this line of code.
- `my` is unchanged by this line of code.
- `count` is unchanged by this line of code.
- `j` is unchanged by this line of code.

The only variable that changes is `mx`, which is assigned the value of `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

However, the condition `if d * d2 > d2:` does not affect the assignment to `mx` because the code snippet does not include the `if` statement. Therefore, the assignment to `mx` always happens.

Now, let's calculate the value of `mx`:

- `d2` is defined as `dx * dx + dy * dy`.
- The expression `d2 * d - d * d` simplifies to `d2 * d - d2 = d2 * (d - 1)`.
- The term `math.sqrt(d2 * (d - 1))` is calculated.
- Finally, `mx` is `cx + dy * (math.sqrt(d2 * (d - 1)) / d2)`.

So, the updated state is:

Output State: **`c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i+2]`, `d` is \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\), `dx` is the same, `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `cx` is the same, `cy` is the same, `my` is the same, `count` is the same, `j` is `i + 2`, and `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy * (d - 1)) / (dx * dx + dy * dy)`**.
