Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `j`, `dy`, `cx`, `cy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `dx` remain as they are. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (i.e., the return value remains unchanged).***
