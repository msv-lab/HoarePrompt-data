Postcondition: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`. The value of `c1 * T` is less than the value of `c2 * T`**
