The code `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2` calculates the value of `dy` based on the current values of `y1` and `y2`. The calculation does not affect the values of `dx`, `c1`, `c2`, `d`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `dy`, `d2`, `my`, `count`, `j`, `cx`, and `cy`. Since the initial state of `dy` was \((y1 - y2) / 2\), this value will be updated to the new calculated value.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\); `c1` and `c2` are swapped if `c1 * T < c2 * T` and remain their original values otherwise; `d` is now \( d / (c1 \times c2) \) if `c1 * T < c2 * T` and remains its original value otherwise; `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2`, `my`, `count`, and `j` are unchanged; `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\); `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\)**.
