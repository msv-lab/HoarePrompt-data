The function `func_2(N, K, meats)` is called with parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. However, the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. The function may return a value, modify the `meats` list, or perform some operations within its scope.

The initial state includes:
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.
- `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`.
- `meats` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `(x, y, c)`, where the original values of `x`, `y`, and `c` are derived from the elements in `data` starting from the third element and incrementing by 3 for each tuple.
- `index` is set to `3 * N + 2`.

Since the function's exact behavior is not specified, the only variable that is definitively impacted by the function call is `result`, which is assigned the return value of `func_2`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is a list of tuples containing (x, y, c), where the original values of x, y, and c are derived from the elements in data starting from the third element and incrementing by 3 for each tuple, `index` is 3 * N + 2, `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`**
