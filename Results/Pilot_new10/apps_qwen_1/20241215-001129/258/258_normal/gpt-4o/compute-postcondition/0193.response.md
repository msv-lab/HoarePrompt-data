Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end + 2`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is updated based on the condition `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `c1` remains the original value of `c2`, `x1` remains the original value of `x2`, `y1` remains the original value of `y2`, and `c2` remains the original value of `c1`. If `d < 0`, the value of `d` is updated to `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Otherwise, the value of `d` remains unchanged.***
