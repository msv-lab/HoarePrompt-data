Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is a list of tuples containing `N` elements, each tuple is `(x, y, c)` where `x`, `y`, and `c` are integers, `index` is `3 * N + 2`, the original values of `x`, `y`, and `c` are the integers corresponding to the elements in `data` starting from `data[2]` and incrementing by 3 for each tuple.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `N` times, appending tuples `(x, y, c)` to the `meats` list. Each iteration increments `index` by 3.
- After `N` iterations, `index` will be `2 + 3 * N`, which is simplified to `3 * N + 2`.
- Since the loop runs exactly `N` times, `meats` will contain `N` tuples, each representing the values of `x`, `y`, and `c` extracted from `data` starting from `data[2]` and incrementing by 3 for each subsequent tuple.
- `data`, `N`, and `K` retain their original values because the loop only modifies `meats` and `index`.
