The code swaps the values of `(x1, y1, c1)` with `(x2, y2, c2)`. Given the initial conditions:

- `i` is less than `N - 1`
- `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`
- `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`
- `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`
- `x2` is the second element of `meats[j]`
- `y2` is the third element of `meats[j]`
- `c2` is the fourth element of `meats[j]`
- The value of `c1 * T` is less than the value of `c2 * T`

After executing the code:

- `x1` is now the second element of `meats[j]` (which was originally `x2`)
- `y1` is now the third element of `meats[j]` (which was originally `y2`)
- `c1` is now the fourth element of `meats[j]` (which was originally `c2`)
- `x2` is now the first element of `meats[i]` (which was originally `x1`)
- `y2` is now the second element of `meats[i]` (which was originally `y1`)
- `c2` is now the third element of `meats[i]` (which was originally `c1`)

The condition `i` is less than `N - 1` remains unchanged. The inequality `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T` also remains true since the values of `c1` and `c2` have been swapped.

Output State: **`i` is less than `N - 1`, `x1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the fourth element of `meats[j]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i]`**
