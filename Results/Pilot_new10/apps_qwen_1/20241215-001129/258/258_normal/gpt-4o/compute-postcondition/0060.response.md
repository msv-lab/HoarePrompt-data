`dy` is reassigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The previous value of `dy` was `(y1 + y2) / 2`. Therefore, the new value of `dy` is different from the previous one.

Output State: **`c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i+2]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `dx` is the same, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is the same, `cx` is the same, `cy` is the same, `my` is the same, `count` is the same, and `j` is `i + 2`.**
