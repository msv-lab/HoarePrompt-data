`meats` is appended with a tuple `(x, y, c)`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `c` are derived from the elements in the `data` list. Specifically, `x` is the integer value of `data[10]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[11]`, and `c` is the integer value of `data[13]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is `[(x, y, c), (x, y, c)]`, `index` is 10, `x` is the integer value of `data[10]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[11]`, `c` is the integer value of the thirteenth element in `data`**
