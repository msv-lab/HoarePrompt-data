According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is the current value of the loop counter.
- `N` must be greater than the current value of `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `N` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i_end + 1`.
- `N` must still be greater than `i_end + 1`.

If we assume `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration (which is not explicitly given but we can represent it symbolically), then:

State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` must be greater than `i_end + 1`**
