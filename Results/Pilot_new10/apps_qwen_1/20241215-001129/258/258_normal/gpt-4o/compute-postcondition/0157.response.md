The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and goes to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop will continue based on the updated conditions. 

Given the precondition and the fact that no variables are reassigned within the `continue` statement, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `c1` is updated to either its original value or `c2` depending on the condition, `c2` is updated to either its original value or `c1` depending on the condition, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`, and the loop continues.**
