The code `meats.append((x, y, c))` adds a new tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`. According to the initial state, `x` is the integer value of the sixth element in `data`, `y` is the integer value of `data[8]`, and `c` is the integer value of the ninth element in `data`. The list `meats` initially contains one tuple `[(x, y, c)]`.

After appending, the list `meats` will contain two tuples: the original tuple and the newly appended tuple. The values of `data`, `N`, `K`, `index`, `x`, `y`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is `[(x, y, c), (x, y, c)]`, `index` is 7, `x` is the integer value of the sixth element in `data`, `y` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `c` is the integer value of the ninth element in `data`.**
