The given code snippet updates the value of `my` based on the formula `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Let's break down the calculation:

- `cy` is defined as `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
- `dx` is defined as `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
- `dy` is defined as `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
- `d2` is defined as `(x1 - x2)`, which is also equal to `2 * dx`.

Given the formula for `my`:
\[ my = cy - dx \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d}}{d2} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ my = \frac{y1 + y2}{2} - dx \cdot \frac{\sqrt{(x1 - x2) \cdot d - (y1 - y2) \cdot d}}{x1 - x2} \]
Since \(d2 = x1 - x2\) and \(d = dy\), the formula simplifies to:
\[ my = \frac{y1 + y2}{2} - dx \cdot \frac{\sqrt{(x1 - x2) \cdot d - (y1 - y2) \cdot d}}{x1 - x2} \]
This further simplifies to:
\[ my = \frac{y1 + y2}{2} - dx \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d}}{d2} \]
\[ my = \frac{y1 + y2}{2} - dx \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d}}{d2} \]
\[ my = \frac{y1 + y2}{2} - dx \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d}}{d2} \]
\[ my = \frac{y1 + y2}{2} - dx \cdot \frac{\sqrt{0}}{d2} \]
\[ my = \frac{y1 + y2}{2} - dx \cdot 0 \]
\[ my = \frac{y1 + y2}{2} \]

So, `my` is simply equal to `cy`, which is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.

The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
