The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`d` is `T * (c1 - c2) / (c1 * c2)`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the fourth element of `meats[j]`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), and the condition `d * d2 > d2` is true**
