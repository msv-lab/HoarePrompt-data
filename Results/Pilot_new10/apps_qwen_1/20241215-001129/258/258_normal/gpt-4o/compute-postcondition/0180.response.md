Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is incremented and less than `K`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `d` is \(\frac{T}{c2} - \frac{T}{c1}\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\). If `d * d2 > d2`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since there is no else part modifying the variables.***
