Let's break down the given for loop and determine the necessary adjustments step by step.

Given:
- State before the loop starts: `i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` must be greater than `i_end + 1`.
- For loop statement: `for j in range(i + 1, N):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `j` starting from `i + 1` up to but not including `N`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, there must be some value of `j` within this range.

2. **Current State of Variables:**
   - `i` is set to `i_end + 1`.
   - `N` is greater than `i_end + 1`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - To ensure the loop runs at least once, `i + 1` (which is `i_end + 2`) must be less than `N`.
   - This means `N` must be greater than `i_end + 2`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is already `i_end + 1`, we need to adjust `N` to ensure the loop condition is met.
   - Therefore, `N` must be greater than `i_end + 2`.

### Final Adjusted States:

- `i` is `i_end + 1`
- `N` must be greater than `i_end + 2` (to ensure the loop runs at least once)

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` must be greater than `i_end + 2`**
