Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `c1` is updated to either its original value or `c2` depending on the condition, `c2` is updated to either its original value or `c1` depending on the condition, `d` is `0` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` or `c1 * T - c2 * T` otherwise, and after the execution of the if-else block, `d` will be updated to 0 if it was less than 0 initially.***
