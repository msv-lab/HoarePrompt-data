Postcondition: **`dx` is the same, `dy` is the same, `d2` is the same, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i+2]`, `d` is the same, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[i+2]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[i+2]`, `cx` is the same, `cy` is the same, `my` is the same, `count` is the same, and `j` is `i + 2`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `c1` is updated to `c2`.**
