The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `meats`, `K`, and `T`. 

- `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of a piece of meat.
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats).
- `T` is an unspecified type but is used within the function to determine the return value.

The function has multiple cases where it returns either `True` or `False`. Given that all cases from 1 to 10 return `True` except for Case_10 which returns `False`, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `meats`, an integer `K`, and an unspecified parameter `T`. It returns `True` in most cases, except when Case_10 is met, in which case it returns `False`.**
