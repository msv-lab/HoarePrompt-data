The function `func_3` accepts a string `data` containing space-separated integers representing the values of `N`, `K`, followed by the coordinates and hardness of `N` pieces of meat. It processes this input to extract the necessary data into variables `N`, `K`, and a list of meat tuples `(x, y, c)`. It then calls `func_2` with `N`, `K`, and the list of meat tuples as arguments. Finally, it prints the result from `func_2` formatted to six decimal places.
