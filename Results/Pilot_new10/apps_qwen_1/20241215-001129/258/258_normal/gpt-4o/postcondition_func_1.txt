The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. It performs a binary search to find the value of `high` such that the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to \(1 \times 10^{-7}\). During the search, it uses the function `func_1` to determine whether a certain condition is met. If `func_1` returns `True`, `high` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`. The function ultimately returns the final value of `high` after the loop terminates.
