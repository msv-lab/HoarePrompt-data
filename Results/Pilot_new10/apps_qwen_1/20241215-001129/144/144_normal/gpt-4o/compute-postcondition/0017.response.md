Let's analyze the provided annotated code and the return postconditions step by step:

1. **Parameters and Input:**
   - The function `func()` takes no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads two inputs:
     - `n`: An integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
     - `a`: A list of `n` integers, where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

2. **Processing:**
   - The function reads these inputs and assigns them to variables `n` and `a`.
   - It then sorts the list `a` in ascending order using `a.sort()`.

3. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to 1.
   - The function iterates through each element `num` in the sorted list `a`:
     - If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the function prints the value of `mex`.

5. **Postconditions and Edge Cases:**
   - The annotations suggest that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`.
   - There are no return statements in the provided code, so the output is printed directly.

6. **Functionality Summary:**
   - The function `func` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and sorts it.
   - It then finds the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `a`.
   - This integer is printed as the output.

**Final Summary:**
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` of length `n` and prints the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list.**
