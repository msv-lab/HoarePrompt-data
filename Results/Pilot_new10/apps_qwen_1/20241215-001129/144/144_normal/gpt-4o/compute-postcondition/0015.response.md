The code prints the value of `mex`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`. However, printing does not assign a value to any variable, it only outputs the value of `mex`. Therefore, the value of `mex` is printed, but none of the variables (`n`, `a`, or `mex`) are changed by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`. `mex` is printed.**
