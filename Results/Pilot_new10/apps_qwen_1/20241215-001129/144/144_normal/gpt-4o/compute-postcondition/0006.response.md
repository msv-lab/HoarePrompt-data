`mex` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `mex` is the original value plus 1. The initial value of `mex` is 1, so after the increment, `mex` is 2. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `num`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `mex` is 2, and the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `mex` is 2, and the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`**
