Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the code does not consider the possibility of decreasing elements in the array to achieve the maximum possible mex value. Instead, it only checks if the current element in the sorted array is greater than or equal to the current mex value and increments mex accordingly. This approach fails to account for the possibility of reducing elements to values less than their original values but still contributing to maximizing the mex value.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
1 3 3 3 6
```
The code will sort the array to `[1, 3, 3, 3, 6]` and then iterate through it. It will find that `1` matches the current mex value (`1`), so it increments mex to `2`. Then it finds another `3`, which also matches the current mex value (`2`), so it increments mex to `3`. Continuing this way, it will conclude that the maximum possible mex is `5`, which is not necessarily the correct answer. The correct answer should be achieved by reducing the elements appropriately, such as changing the second element to `2` and the fifth element to `4`, leading to the array `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]` with mex equal to `5`.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
