According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` is a non-empty list of integers since the loop iterates over each element in `arr`.

Before the loop starts, we know the following:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `n` is an integer input from standard input.
- `mex` is initially set to 1.

To ensure the loop can execute, `arr` must be a non-empty list. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `arr` must contain at least one element.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, `mex` is 1**
