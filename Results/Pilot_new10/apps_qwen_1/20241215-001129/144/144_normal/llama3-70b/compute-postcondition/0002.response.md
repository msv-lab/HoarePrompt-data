The `sort()` method is called on the list `arr`, which sorts the list in ascending order. However, the `sort()` method does not return a value; it sorts the list in place. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the new integer input from the standard input**
