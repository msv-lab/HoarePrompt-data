Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the sorted list `arr`.
- If the current element `num` is equal to `mex`, `mex` is incremented by 1.
- If `num` is greater than `mex`, the loop breaks, meaning no further increments are made to `mex`.

After the loop completes, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `arr`. If `arr` contains all integers from 0 up to some maximum value, `mex` will be the next integer after the largest value in `arr`.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `arr` is empty), `mex` will remain its initial value of 1, but since `arr` is empty, `mex` will effectively become 0, the smallest non-negative integer not in an empty list.

Therefore, regardless of whether the loop executes or not, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`.
