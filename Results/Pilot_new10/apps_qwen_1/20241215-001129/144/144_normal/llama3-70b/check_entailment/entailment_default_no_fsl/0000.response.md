Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code only checks if the current number in the sorted array is equal to the current mex value or greater than the mex value. However, it does not account for the fact that Alyona can decrease any element to any positive integer less than or equal to its original value.

Consider the following case:

Input:
```
4
2 2 2 2
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

However, the current code would output:
```
2
```

This is because the code only increments mex when the current number in the sorted array is exactly equal to mex, without considering the possibility of decreasing the elements to values that could potentially increase the mex value.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the mex value is increased whenever it encounters a number in the sorted array that is greater than the current mex value. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = 1
    for num in arr:
        if num >= mex:
            mex += 1
    print(mex)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the mex value is properly incremented whenever the current number in the sorted array is greater than or equal to the current mex value, thus correctly handling all potential cases.
