Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment was correct. The provided annotated version of the code still does not handle the case where all elements in the array are equal to the current `mex` value. Specifically, after sorting the array, the loop will only increment `mex` if it encounters an element that is equal to the current `mex` value. If all elements are equal to `mex`, the loop will not increment `mex` further and will break prematurely. For example, with the input:

```
3
2 2 2
```

The sorted array is `[2, 2, 2]`, and `mex` starts at 1. Since `2` is greater than `1`, the loop will break without incrementing `mex`, resulting in an incorrect output of `3` instead of the correct output of `2`. Thus, the program does not correctly compute the maximum possible value of mex in this case.
