Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to meet the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the length `n` and the genome string `s` as specified in the problem description.
   
2. **Count Calculation**: The program calculates the frequency of each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') using a dictionary `count`. It increments the count for each non-question-mark character and initializes the count for each nucleotide to zero.

3. **Average Calculation**: The program calculates the average number of each nucleotide required (`avg = n // 4`). 

4. **Replacement Logic**: For each question mark in the string `s`, the program tries to replace it with any of the four nucleotides ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') such that the final count of each nucleotide matches the required average. If a valid replacement is found, it updates the count and adds the nucleotide to the result string `res`.

5. **Validation**: After attempting to replace all question marks, the program checks if any nucleotide count remains non-zero. If so, it prints '===' indicating that it's not possible to satisfy the condition. Otherwise, it prints the modified string `res`.

The program handles all edge cases:
- If the genome is already correctly balanced, no question marks will remain, and the original string is printed.
- If it’s impossible to balance the counts (e.g., an odd number of question marks and an even distribution of nucleotides is not possible), the program correctly outputs '==='.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all possible inputs, making it correct.
