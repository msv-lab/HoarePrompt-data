Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the length of the genome `n` and the encoded genome string `s`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `count` to keep track of the occurrences of each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T').

2. **Counting Nucleotides**:
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`. For each non-'?' character, it increments the corresponding count in the dictionary `count`.

3. **Calculating Average**:
   - The program calculates the average number of each nucleotide needed for the genome to be balanced (`avg = n // 4`).

4. **Adjusting Counts**:
   - For each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T'), it adjusts the count to ensure that the difference between the current count and the average is accounted for. This ensures that the final genome will have an equal number of each nucleotide.

5. **Decoding the Genome**:
   - The program constructs the decoded genome string `res` by iterating over `s`. For each '?', it selects the first available nucleotide from 'ACGT' and decrements the corresponding count in `count`.

6. **Validation**:
   - After constructing the decoded genome, the program checks if all counts in `count` are zero. If they are, it prints the decoded genome. Otherwise, it prints "===" indicating that it's not possible to decode the genome with equal nucleotides.

### Why It Works for Every Case:

- **Balancing Nucleotides**: The program ensures that the final genome will have an equal number of each nucleotide by adjusting the counts appropriately. This is crucial because the problem requires that each nucleotide appears the same number of times.
  
- **Handling '?' Characters**: The program handles '?' characters by replacing them with the most appropriate nucleotide to balance the counts, ensuring that the final genome meets the requirement.

- **Edge Cases**: 
  - If the initial counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' are already balanced, the program will output the original string.
  - If the total count of nucleotides is not divisible by 4, the program correctly identifies this and outputs "===".

Thus, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all cases as required.
