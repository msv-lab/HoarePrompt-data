You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly decode the genome under the given constraints. Here’s why:

1. **Initialization and Counting**: The program initializes a dictionary `count` to keep track of the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' nucleotides, excluding the '?' characters.
2. **Average Calculation**: It calculates the average number of each type of nucleotide needed (`avg = n // 4`).
3. **Decoding Loop**: For each '?' character in the string, it replaces it with the first available nucleotide from 'ACGT' that has a positive count in the `count` dictionary.
4. **Validation**: After the loop, it checks if any nucleotide count is still above zero. If so, it prints "===" indicating it's impossible to decode; otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

Given the examples provided and the general logic of the program, it handles all valid cases correctly. The program ensures that each nucleotide type ends up with an equal count, and it handles the scenario where decoding is impossible by checking the final counts. Since no counterexample was found, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    if any(count.values()) :
        print('===')
    else :
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `res` is a string where every '?' in `s` is replaced by one of 'ACGT' such that each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') is used exactly `n // 4` times, and `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` are all 0. The string `res` contains all other characters from `s` as they appear.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
