Postcondition: ***`c` is an integer or character, `res` is the concatenation of `'ACGT'` and `c` if `c` is `'?'; otherwise, `res` remains as `res + c` and `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` are updated based on the value of `c`.*** 

Explanation:
- If `c` is `'?':` then `res` is initialized to `'ACGT'` and concatenated with `c`, which means `res` becomes `'ACGT?'`.
- If `c` is not `'?':` then `res` is simply appended with `c` and `count` dictionary is updated according to the value of `c`:
  - If `c` is 'A', `count['A']` is incremented by 1.
  - If `c` is 'C', `count['C']` is incremented by 1.
  - If `c` is 'G', `count['G']` is incremented by 1.
  - If `c` is 'T', `count['T']` is incremented by 1.
