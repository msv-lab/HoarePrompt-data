Postcondition: **`res` is a string where every '?' in `s` is replaced by one of 'ACGT' such that each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') is used exactly `n // 4` times, and `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` are all 0. The string `res` contains all other characters from `s` as they appear.**
