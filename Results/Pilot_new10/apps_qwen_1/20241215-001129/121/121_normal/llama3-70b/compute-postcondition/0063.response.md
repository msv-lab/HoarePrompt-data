Postcondition: **`c` is the next character in the string `s`, `res` is the concatenation of `'ACGT'` and `c` if `c` is `'?'; otherwise, `res` remains as `res + c`, and `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` are updated based on the value of `c`, and the condition `c != '?'` holds true**
