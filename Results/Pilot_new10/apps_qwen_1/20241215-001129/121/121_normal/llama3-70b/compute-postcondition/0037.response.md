`res` is assigned the value of `res` concatenated with `nc`. Given that `res` is initially 'C' and `nc` is 'T', the value of `res` becomes 'CT'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is an integer or character with the current value being '?', `'ACGT'` must exist and be non-empty, `nc` is 'T', `res` is 'CT'.
Output State: **`c` is an integer or character with the current value being '?', `'ACGT'` must exist and be non-empty, `nc` is 'T', `res` is 'CT'**
