`nc` is subtracted from `count[nc]`. Since `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` are all initially greater than 0, and `nc` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', the value of `count[nc]` will be decreased by 1. The other counts and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count['A']` is greater than 0, `count['C']` is greater than 0, `count['G']` is greater than 0, `count['T']` is greater than 0; `res` is equal to `res` plus `nc`, `count[nc]` is reduced by 1**
