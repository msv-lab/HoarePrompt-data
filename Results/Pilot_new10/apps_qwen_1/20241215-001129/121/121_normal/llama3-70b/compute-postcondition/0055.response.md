The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested block of code it is inside. In this case, since there is no loop or nested block of code mentioned, the only affected variable is `c`, which will no longer be modified by the subsequent code. The states of the other variables (`ACGT`, `res`, `count['A']`, `count['C'] - 1`, `count['G']`, `count['T']`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ACGT` must not be empty, `c` is no longer modified, `res` is `count['A'] + 'C'`, `count['A']`, `count['C'] - 1`, `count['G']`, `count['T']`**
