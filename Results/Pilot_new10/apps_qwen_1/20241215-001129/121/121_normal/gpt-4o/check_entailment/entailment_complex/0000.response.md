Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly, splitting it into the length of the genome (`n`) and the genome string (`s`).

2. **Divisibility Check**: It checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints `===` and exits, as per the problem statement.

3. **Count Calculation**: It calculates the target count of each nucleotide type, which should be `n // 4`.

4. **Count Verification**: It verifies that no nucleotide type exceeds the target count. If any nucleotide count exceeds `target_count`, it prints `===` and exits.

5. **Replacement Logic**: If all checks pass, it replaces the `?` characters with nucleotides such that the count of each nucleotide type does not exceed `target_count`. The replacement is done in a way that ensures the condition is met.

6. **Output**: It prints the modified genome string and exits.

### Cases Covered:

- **Case where `n` is not divisible by 4**: The program correctly prints `===`.
- **Case where `n` is divisible by 4 but some nucleotide counts exceed `target_count`**: The program correctly prints `===`.
- **Case where `n` is divisible by 4 and nucleotide counts can be balanced**: The program correctly modifies and prints the genome string.

Since the program handles all the cases as specified in the problem description, it is correct.
