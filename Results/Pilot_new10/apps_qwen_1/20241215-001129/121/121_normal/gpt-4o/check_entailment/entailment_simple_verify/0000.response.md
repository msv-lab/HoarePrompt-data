Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle cases where it is impossible to distribute the question marks such that the count of each nucleotide becomes equal. Specifically, the program attempts to fill the question marks without first checking if it is feasible to do so. 

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 8
s = "GGGG????"
```
The program will try to fill the four question marks with 'A', 'C', and 'T', but it fails to recognize that it is impossible to achieve the required balance because there are already four 'G's. Therefore, the program should output "===" but may incorrectly attempt to fill the question marks, leading to incorrect results. This behavior contradicts the requirement that the program should print "===" if it is not possible to decode the genome correctly.
