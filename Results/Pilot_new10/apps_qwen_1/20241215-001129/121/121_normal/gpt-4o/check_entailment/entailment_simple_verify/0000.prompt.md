You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of nucleotides of each type cannot be equal after replacing the question marks. Specifically, the program does not check if it is possible to distribute the question marks among the nucleotides such that their counts become equal. For example, consider the input:

```
n = 8
s = "GGGG????"
```

In this case, there are 4 'G's already, and we need 4 more nucleotides to make the counts equal. However, there are only 4 question marks, and they need to be distributed among 'A', 'C', and 'T'. Since we cannot satisfy the condition of having exactly one of each type for the remaining positions, the program should output "===" but instead, it will attempt to fill the question marks without checking the feasibility, leading to incorrect results.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The input consists of two lines: the first line is an integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line is a string s of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' representing the coded genome.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, `s` is the second element of the `data` list, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `input` is the concatenated string of the input values, and n is divisible by 4
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 255\) and `n` is still divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string that is completely exhausted (i.e., `s` becomes an empty string), `data` is the same list, `input` is the same concatenated string, `target_count` is \(n // 4\), and `counts` is a dictionary with the count of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') found in the string `s`.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return

If there exists any character `char` in `counts` such that the count of `char` is greater than `target_count`, the function returns `target_count` which is \(n // 4\); otherwise, the function returns `None`.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `counts` is a dictionary where the sum of all values is exactly `target_count`, `result` is a list containing each character of `s` where the corresponding `counts[char]` is less than or equal to `target_count`, and `i` is `n` if the loop executed `n` times, otherwise `i` is `0`.
    print(''.join(result))
- `None` if the length of the genome is not divisible by 4.
- A character `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'` that appears more than `n // 4` times in the string `s` if such a character exists.
- `n // 4` if the genome can be transformed such that the count of each nucleotide `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'` is at most `n // 4`, and all `'?'` characters in the string `s` are replaced with the appropriate nucleotides.
- Prints the modified genome string and returns `None` if all nucleotides in `s` are balanced according to the condition `n // 4`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
