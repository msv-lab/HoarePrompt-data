Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary where the sum of all values is exactly `target_count - 1`, `result` is a list containing each character of `s` where the corresponding `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, and `i` is 2. If `counts[char] < target_count`, an IndexError is raised and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to `counts`, `result`, and `i`.***
