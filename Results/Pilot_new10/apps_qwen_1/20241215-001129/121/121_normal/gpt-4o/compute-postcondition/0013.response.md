Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, `s` is the second element of the `data` list and must be a non-empty string, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `input` is the concatenated string of the input values, `target_count` is n // 4, `n` is divisible by 4, `counts` is a dictionary with one of the following states depending on the value of `char`: {'A': 1, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}, {'A': 0, 'C': 1, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}, {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 1, 'T': 0}, or {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 1}, where `char` is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' and is updated in the `counts` dictionary if found. If `char` is not in the `counts` dictionary, the postcondition remains unchanged as specified in the else part.***
