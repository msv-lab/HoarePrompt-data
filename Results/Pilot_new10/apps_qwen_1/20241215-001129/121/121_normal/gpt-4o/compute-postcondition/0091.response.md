Postcondition: ***`counts` is a non-empty dictionary with the same keys and values where the value associated with `char` is either `target_count + 2` or remains unchanged (if the condition `counts[char] < target_count` is false). The sum of all values in `counts` is `target_count + 2`, and `result[i]` is equal to `char`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
