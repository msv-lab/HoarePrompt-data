Postcondition: **`counts` is a dictionary where the sum of all values is exactly `target_count`, `result` is a list containing each character of `s` where the corresponding `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, and `i` is the index of the last modified element in `result` or 0 if no modification was made. This holds whether `result[i]` is `'?'` or not.**
