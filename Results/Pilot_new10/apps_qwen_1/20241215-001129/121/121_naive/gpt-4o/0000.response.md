Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of nucleotides of each type cannot be equal after replacing the question marks. Specifically, the program does not check if it is possible to distribute the question marks among the nucleotides such that their counts become equal. For example, consider the input:

```
n = 8
s = "GGGG????"
```

In this case, there are 4 'G's already, and we need 4 more nucleotides to make the counts equal. However, there are only 4 question marks, and they need to be distributed among 'A', 'C', and 'T'. Since we cannot satisfy the condition of having exactly one of each type for the remaining positions, the program should output "===" but instead, it will attempt to fill the question marks without checking the feasibility, leading to incorrect results.
