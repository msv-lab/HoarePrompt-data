Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the total number of nucleotides is not divisible by 4. In such cases, it is impossible to decode the genome such that each nucleotide type appears an equal number of times. However, the program does not check for this condition before attempting to decode the genome, leading to incorrect outputs. For example, consider the input:

```
Input:
8
????GTT?
```

In this case, the number of nucleotides is 8, and after replacing the question marks, we get `ACGTGTTA`, which is not possible since the count of 'A' and 'T' will be 3, and 'C' and 'G' will be 1. The program will output `ACGTGTTA`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
