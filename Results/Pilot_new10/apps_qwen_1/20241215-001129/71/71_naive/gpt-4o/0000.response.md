Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the number itself is already divisible by \(10^k\) and has fewer than \(k\) trailing zeros. Specifically, if the last \(k\) digits of the number form a multiple of \(10^k\), the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly. 

For example, consider the input:
- Input: `10203040 4`
- Expected Output: `3` (since we need to remove three digits: `1`, `2`, and `3` to make the number `03040`, which is divisible by \(10^4 = 10000\))
- Actual Output: `2` (the program only counts the digits other than zeros, but does not remove the necessary digits correctly)

Thus, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of digits to remove in all cases.
