Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Zeros and Digits Removal:**
   - The program attempts to count the number of consecutive zeros (`count_zeros`) in the reversed string representation of `n`. However, this approach doesn't ensure that the resulting number is divisible by \(10^k\).
   - It incorrectly assumes that once `count_zeros` equals `k`, the number is divisible by \(10^k\). This is not necessarily true. For instance, consider the input `10203049 2`. The program would count three zeros and stop, but the resulting number `1020304` is not divisible by \(10^2 = 100\).

2. **Incorrect Logic for Non-Zero Digits:**
   - The variable `to_remove` is incremented whenever a non-zero digit is encountered. This does not align with the requirement to remove the minimum number of digits to make the number divisible by \(10^k\). For example, in the input `100 9`, the program would remove two digits (1 and 0), resulting in 0, which is correct. But in other cases, like `30020 3`, it would incorrectly count 1 as needing removal, when actually just removing 2 results in `3000`.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The program fails to handle cases where the number itself is already divisible by \(10^k\) without any modifications. For example, in the input `1000 3`, the program would incorrectly output `4` instead of `0`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the following steps should be taken:
1. Convert the number to a string.
2. Iterate through the string to find the first sequence of at least `k` trailing zeros.
3. If found, calculate the number of digits to remove by subtracting the position of the last non-zero digit (if any) from the end of the string, plus the remaining digits beyond the sequence of `k` zeros.
4. If no such sequence is found, the number needs to be reduced to `0` by removing all but the last digit.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    n_str = str(n)
    length = len(n_str)
    
    # Find the first sequence of at least k trailing zeros
    i = length - 1
    while i >= 0 and length - i > k:
        if n_str[i] != '0':
            break
        i -= 1
    
    # Calculate the number of digits to remove
    if i >= 0:
        to_remove = length - (i + k)
    else:
        to_remove = length - 1
    
    print(to_remove)

# Example usage
func()
```

This version ensures that the number is made divisible by \(10^k\) by removing the minimum number of digits, handling edge cases properly, and adhering to the problem description.
