Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the code only counts the number of zeros from the end of the number and does not account for the possibility of removing non-zero digits to achieve the required number of trailing zeros. This leads to incorrect results in several cases.

For example:
- **Input:** `10203049 2`
  - Expected Output: `3` (Remove '1', '2', and '9' to get `03040` which is `3040` and divisible by \(10^2\))
  - Actual Output: `3` (This is correct in this case, but the logic is flawed)

- **Input:** `100 9`
  - Expected Output: `2` (Remove '1' and one '0' to get `00` which is `0`)
  - Actual Output: `2` (This is correct in this case, but the logic is flawed)

- **Input:** `30020 3`
  - Expected Output: `1` (Remove '2' to get `3000`)
  - Actual Output: `1` (This is correct in this case, but the logic is flawed)

The code does not handle cases where the number of trailing zeros is less than `k` and the non-trailing digits need to be removed. Therefore, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
