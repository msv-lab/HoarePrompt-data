`to_remove` is incremented by 1. Initially, `to_remove` is 1 if the new rightmost digit is not '0', and 0 if it is '0'. After incrementing, `to_remove` will be 2 if the new rightmost digit is not '0', and 1 if it is '0'. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `count_zeros`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string (without the rightmost digit), `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the new rightmost digit is '0', and `to_remove` is 2 if the new rightmost digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 1.**
