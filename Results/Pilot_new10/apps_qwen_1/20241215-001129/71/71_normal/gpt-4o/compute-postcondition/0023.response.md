The code `break` does not affect any variables and simply exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there are no loops or conditionals being exited here, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with the rightmost digit removed, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 3 if the initial value was 2 and the new rightmost digit is '0', or 2 if the initial value was 2 and the new rightmost digit is not '0', or 2 if the initial value was 1 and the new rightmost digit is '0', or 3 if the initial value was 1 and the new rightmost digit is not '0', `to_remove` is 2 if the new rightmost digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 1.**
