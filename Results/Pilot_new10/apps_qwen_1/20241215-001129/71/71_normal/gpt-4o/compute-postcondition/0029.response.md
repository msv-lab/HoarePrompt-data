The code `print(len(n) - 1)` prints the length of the string `n` minus 1. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `count_zeros`, and `to_remove`. The output of this line is simply the length of the string `n` minus 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of zeros in the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` does not reach `k`, `to_remove` is the number of digits removed from the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` does not reach `k`, and the output is `len(n) - 1`.**
