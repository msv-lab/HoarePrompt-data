The value of `to_remove` is incremented by 1. Initially, `to_remove` is 2 if the new rightmost digit is not '0', otherwise it is 1. Incrementing `to_remove` by 1, it becomes 3 if the new rightmost digit is not '0', and remains 2 if the new rightmost digit is '0'. The values of `n`, `k`, and `count_zeros` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with the rightmost digit removed, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 2 or 1, and `to_remove` is 3 if the new rightmost digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 2.**
