`n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which splits the input into two parts and converts them to strings using `map(str, ...)`. The initial conditions for `n` and `k` are that `n` is an integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000 (inclusive), and `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). After executing the code, these conditions are no longer directly applicable because `n` and `k` are now strings.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `k` is a string**
