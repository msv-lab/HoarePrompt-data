`count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count_zeros` is either 2 or 1, so after incrementing, the value of `count_zeros` will be 3 or 2, respectively. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `to_remove`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with the rightmost digit removed, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 3 if initially 2 or 2 if initially 1, and `to_remove` is 2 if the new rightmost digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 1.**
