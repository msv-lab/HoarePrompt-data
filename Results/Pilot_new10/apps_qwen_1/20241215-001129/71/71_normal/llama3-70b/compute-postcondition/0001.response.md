`w` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `w` is set to 0, but the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive; `w` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive; `w` is 0**
