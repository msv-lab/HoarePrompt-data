`n` is initially an integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive and not divisible by 10. After running `n //= 10`, the value of `n` is updated to be `n` divided by 10 and rounded down to the nearest integer. Since `n` is not divisible by 10, the operation `n //= 10` reduces `n` by a factor of 10 without causing a remainder.

The variable `w` is updated to `w + 1` in the initial state, but this value is not affected by the operation `n //= 10`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is reduced to an integer between 0 and 200,000,000 inclusive and still not divisible by 10; `w` is `w + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is reduced to an integer between 0 and 200,000,000 inclusive and still not divisible by 10; `w` is `w + 1`.**
