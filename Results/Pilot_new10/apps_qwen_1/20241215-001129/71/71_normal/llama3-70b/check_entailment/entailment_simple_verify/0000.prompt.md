You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the number itself is already divisible by \(10^k\). In such cases, no digits need to be removed, but the program incorrectly increments the counter `w` until the number becomes zero.

For example, consider the input:
```
Input
1000 3
```
The expected output is `0` because the number `1000` is already divisible by \(10^3 = 1000\). However, the program will increment `w` until `n` becomes zero, resulting in an output of `4`.

To fix this, the program should check if the number is already divisible by \(10^k\) before entering the loop. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    if n % 10 ** k == 0:
        print(0)
        return
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles cases where the number is already divisible by \(10^k\).

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters but relies on input from stdin in the form of two space-separated integers n and k, where 0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 9, and guarantees that the answer exists.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'n' is reduced to an integer between 0 and 2,000,000 inclusive and still not divisible by \(10^k\), 'w' is the number of times the loop executed.
    print(w)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
