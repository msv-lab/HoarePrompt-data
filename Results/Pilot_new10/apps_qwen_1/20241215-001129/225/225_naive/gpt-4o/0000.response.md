Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to jump from the beginning to the end of the string, landing only on vowels. The logic iterates through the string, tracking the maximum jump length between consecutive vowels and also considers the final jump to the end of the string. The program handles all potential cases where the string contains vowels and ensures that the maximum jump length is accurately calculated.
