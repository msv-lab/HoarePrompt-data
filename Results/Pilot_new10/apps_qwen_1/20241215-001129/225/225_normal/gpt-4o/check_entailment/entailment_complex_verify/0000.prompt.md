You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.


-----Examples-----
Input

Output
4
Input
AAA

Output
1
Program:
```
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to jump from the beginning to the end of the string, landing only on vowels. The logic iterates through the string, tracking the maximum jump length between consecutive vowels and also considers the final jump to the end of the string. The program handles all potential cases where the string contains vowels and ensures that the maximum jump length is accurately calculated.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of s does not exceed 100. The string may contain the following vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'.
def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `i` is `len(s)`, `prev_pos` is the last index where a vowel was found in the string `s`, and `max_jump` is the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string `s`.
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump
    #The program returns max_jump which is the maximum value between its original value and i - prev_pos, where i is len(s) and prev_pos is the last index where a vowel was found in the string s
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string. If no vowels are present, it returns the length of the string plus one.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
