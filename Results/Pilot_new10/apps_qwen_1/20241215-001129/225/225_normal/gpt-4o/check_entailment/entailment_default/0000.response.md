Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the requirement to find the minimum jump ability needed to reach the far end of the string by jumping only on vowels. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string, but this is not equivalent to the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string. For instance, consider the input "ABABBBACFEYUKOTT". The maximum distance between consecutive vowels is 4, but the grasshopper needs to be able to jump a maximum of 5 positions (from 'C' to 'F') to reach the end of the string. Therefore, the function does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
