The code updates `max_jump` to be the maximum value between its current value and the length of the string `s` minus the `prev_pos`. Given that `i` is equal to `len(s)`, the value of `len(s)` is now known to be `i`. The updated `max_jump` will be the maximum of its original value and `i - prev_pos`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `i` is `len(s)`, `prev_pos` is the last index where a vowel was found in the string `s`, `max_jump` is the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `len(s)`, `prev_pos` is the last index where a vowel was found in the string `s`, `max_jump` is the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`**
