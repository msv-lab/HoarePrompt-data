`prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the index `i + 1` within the string `s`, so `prev_pos` is now `i + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `i` is the index `i + 1` within the string `s`, `prev_pos` is `i + 1`, and `max_jump` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is the index `i + 1` within the string `s`, `prev_pos` is `i + 1`, and `max_jump` remains unchanged.**
