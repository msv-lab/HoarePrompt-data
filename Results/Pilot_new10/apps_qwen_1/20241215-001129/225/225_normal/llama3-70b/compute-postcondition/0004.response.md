The code `last_vowel = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `last_vowel`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `vowels`, `n`, or `max_jump`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `last_vowel`.

Output State: **`s` is the user input string, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 0, `last_vowel` is -1**
