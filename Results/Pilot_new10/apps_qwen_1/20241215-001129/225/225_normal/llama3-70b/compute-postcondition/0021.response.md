The code updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum between its current value (`max_jump`) and `i + 1`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we consider that `max_jump` is initially 1 (as per the precondition).

Let's assume `i` has some value, say `i = 2` for demonstration purposes. The impact of the code would be to update `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value (which is 1) and `i + 1` (which is 3). Thus, `max_jump` would be updated to 3.

Output State: **`max_jump` is 3**
