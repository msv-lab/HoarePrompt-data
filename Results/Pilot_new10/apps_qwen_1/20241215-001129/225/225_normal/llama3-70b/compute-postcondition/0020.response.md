Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is the user input string.
   - `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `max_jump` is 1.
   - `last_vowel` is 1.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - If the character at index `i` in `s` is a vowel, then `max_jump` is set to 2.
   - Otherwise, `max_jump` remains 1.

4. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.
   - Therefore, we need to check if the character at index `i=1` (which is the second character in the string) is a vowel or not.

5. **Determining the Next State:**
   - If the character at index `1` is a vowel, then `max_jump` becomes 2.
   - If the character at index `1` is not a vowel, then `max_jump` remains 1.
   - Regardless of the value of `max_jump`, it will remain 1 because the condition for setting `max_jump` to 2 only checks the current character, and the previous value of `max_jump` does not affect this.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
   - `max_jump` will still be 1 unless the character at index `2` is a vowel, but since we are determining the state at the start of the next iteration, we assume it remains 1.
   - All other states (`s`, `vowels`, `n`, `last_vowel`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `s` is the user input string, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is 1, and `i` is 2.**
