Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a non-empty string of capital English letters as input, which matches the problem description.
2. **Vowel Identification**: The program uses the string `vowels = 'AEIOUY'` to identify vowels, which includes all the specified vowels.
3. **Jump Calculation Logic**:
   - The variable `max_jump` is initialized to store the maximum jump length.
   - `last_vowel` keeps track of the index of the last vowel encountered.
   - For each character in the string, if it is a vowel, the program calculates the necessary jump length to reach the next vowel and updates `max_jump` accordingly.
   - After the loop, if the last vowel is not the last character of the string, the program accounts for the remaining distance to the end of the string.
4. **Output**: The final value of `max_jump` is printed, which represents the minimum jump ability needed.

The program correctly handles all cases where the string can have any valid length up to 100 characters and can include any combination of vowels and consonants. It ensures that the Grasshopper jumps only on vowels and calculates the maximum jump length required to reach the end of the string. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
