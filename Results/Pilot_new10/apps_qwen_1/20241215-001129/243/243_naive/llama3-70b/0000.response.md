Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to find the smallest integer `n` such that the factorial of `n` has at least `m` trailing zeroes, and then it prints all integers from 1 up to that `n`. However, the logic inside the loops is flawed.

1. In the first loop, the program increments `count` until `n // 5 ** count >= m`, but this condition is not sufficient to ensure that the factorial of `n` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The program needs to find the exact value of `n` such that the factorial of `n` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

2. In the second loop, the program appends all integers from 1 to `n` to the list `ans`, which is not correct because it does not filter out the numbers whose factorials do not end with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n` and check when this count equals `m`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    n = 0
    while True:
        n += 1
        temp_count = 0
        x = n
        while x > 0:
            temp_count += x // 5
            x //= 5
        if temp_count == m:
            count += 1
        elif temp_count > m:
            break
    print(count)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        temp_count = 0
        x = i
        while x > 0:
            temp_count += x // 5
            x //= 5
        if temp_count == m:
            print(i, end=' ')
    print()

func()
```

This corrected version correctly counts the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of each number and checks if it matches `m`. It then prints the count and the corresponding numbers.
