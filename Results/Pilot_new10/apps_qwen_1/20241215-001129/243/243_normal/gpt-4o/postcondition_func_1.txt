The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\) and returns a list of integers `n` for which `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The function uses binary search to find the range of such integers, updating the bounds `low` and `high` based on the count of trailing zeroes returned by `func_1(mid)`. If the count matches `m`, it further narrows down the exact range by finding the boundaries where the count of trailing zeroes changes.
