Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial of \( n \) (\( n! \)) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes, where \( 1 \leq m \leq 100,000 \).

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) using the formula:
   \[
   \text{count} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
   \]
   This function correctly computes the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \), which is based on the number of factors of 5 in \( n! \).

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses binary search to find the range of \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. It initializes the search bounds with \( \text{low} = 0 \) and \( \text{high} = 5 \times (m + 1) \).

   - If the number of trailing zeroes in the middle value \( \text{mid} \) is less than \( m \), it means \( n \) needs to be increased, so the lower bound is updated to \( \text{mid} + 1 \).
   - If the number of trailing zeroes is greater than \( m \), it means \( n \) needs to be decreased, so the upper bound is updated to \( \text{mid} - 1 \).
   - If the number of trailing zeroes is exactly \( m \), it indicates a match, and the function further narrows down the range by finding the nearest bounds where the number of trailing zeroes is still \( m \).

4. **Output Handling**: The main program calls `func_2(m)` and prints the results accordingly:
   - If `result` is not empty, it prints the length of `result` followed by the values in `result` separated by spaces.
   - If `result` is empty, it prints `0`.

This implementation ensures that the program finds and outputs the correct number of integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. The binary search approach efficiently narrows down the range, and the calculations for trailing zeroes are accurate. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs.
