Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find all positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial of \( n \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. Here's a breakdown of why the code works for every potential case:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) by counting the factors of 5 (and higher powers of 5) in the numbers from 1 to \( n \). This is done using the formula \( \text{count} = n // 5 + n // 25 + n // 125 + \ldots \).

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses a binary search approach to find the range of integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. It narrows down the range by adjusting the `low` and `high` bounds based on the number of trailing zeroes returned by `func_1(mid)`. Once it finds a midpoint where the number of trailing zeroes equals \( m \), it then searches the adjacent values to determine the exact range of integers that satisfy the condition.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the code handles all potential cases correctly. For instance, it can handle large values of \( m \) up to 100,000 efficiently due to the binary search approach. Additionally, the code accounts for the transition points where the number of trailing zeroes increases, ensuring it captures all valid ranges of \( n \).
