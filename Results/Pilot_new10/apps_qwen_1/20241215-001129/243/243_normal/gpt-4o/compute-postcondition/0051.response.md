The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The function call `func_1(right + 1)` must be equal to `m` before the increment, so after the increment, the function call `func_1((right - 1) + 1)` must still be equal to `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1(right + 1)` must be equal to `m`; `right` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`func_1(right + 1)` must be equal to `m`; `right` is increased by 1**
