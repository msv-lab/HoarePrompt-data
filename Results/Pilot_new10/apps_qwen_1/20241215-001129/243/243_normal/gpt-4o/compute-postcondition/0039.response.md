`left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), so `left` is now \((low + high) // 2\). The values of `m`, `low`, `high`, `zeroes`, `result`, and `right` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` must be less than `high`; `left` is \((low + high) // 2\); `mid` is updated to \((low + high) // 2\); `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `high` and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration.**
