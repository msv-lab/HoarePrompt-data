The code calculates the midpoint between `low` and `high` and assigns it to `mid`. Given the initial state:

- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\)
- `result` is an empty list

The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which translates to:

\[ mid = (0 + 5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 = (5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 \]

Since `m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `5 \times (m + 1)` will be an integer between 10 and 500,005. Dividing this by 2 will give an integer value for `mid`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 \* (m + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 \* (m + 1)) // 2**
