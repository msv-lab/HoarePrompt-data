The code initializes an empty list for `result`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `left`, `right`). Therefore, the output state retains the values of the other variables as they were before this line of code was executed.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `mid - 1`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` if `zeroes > m`, `mid` is now \((low + high) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration.**
