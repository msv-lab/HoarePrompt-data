The code `left -= 1` decreases the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was previously set to `mid`, and `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), decreasing `left` by 1 means that the new value of `left` is now \((low + high) // 2 - 1\). The values of `high`, `m`, `zeroes`, `result`, and `low` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are initialized in a way that `func_1(mid)` returns `m` when `left` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 1\), `high` retains its value from the last iteration**
