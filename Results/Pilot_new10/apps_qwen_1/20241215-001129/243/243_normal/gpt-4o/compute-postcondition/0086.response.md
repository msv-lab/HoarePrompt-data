Output State: **`The program returns a list of integers from left + 1 to right - 1, where left and right are determined based on the conditions within the loop: if zeroes < m, then low is updated to mid + 1 or mid - 1, and high remains 5 * (m + 1); if zeroes > m, then low remains unchanged and high is updated to mid - 1; if zeroes == m, then left is found by decrementing from mid until func_1(left) != m, and right is found by incrementing from mid + 1 until func_1(right) != m.`**
