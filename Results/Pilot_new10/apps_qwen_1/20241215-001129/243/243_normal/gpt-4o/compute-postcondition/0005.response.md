The code assigns the result of `func_1(mid)` to the variable `zeroes`. The value of `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact value of `zeroes`. However, the preconditions and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 \* (m + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 \* (m + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is func_1(mid)**
