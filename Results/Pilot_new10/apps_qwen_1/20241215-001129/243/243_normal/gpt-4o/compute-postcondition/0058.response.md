Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\). `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `mid - 1` depending on the value of `zeroes` relative to `m`. `high` is updated to `mid - 1` if `zeroes > m`. `mid` remains the same in the if part and is updated to \((low + high) // 2\) in the else part. `zeroes` remains the same in the if part and is updated to the value returned by `func_1(mid)` in the else part. `result` remains unchanged in the if part. In the else part, `right` is incremented to a value where `func_1(right)` is no longer equal to `m`, and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. `left` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration in both parts.***
