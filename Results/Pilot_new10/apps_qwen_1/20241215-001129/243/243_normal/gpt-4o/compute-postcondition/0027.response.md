The code snippet increments `right` by 1. Based on the initial state, `right` is calculated as \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 3\). After incrementing `right`, the new value of `right` will be \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 4\).

The states of `m` and the loop condition `func_1(right) == m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the loop condition will still hold as long as `func_1(right)` returns `m`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `right` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 4\)**
