`left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (m + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is func_1(mid); `left` is (5 * (m + 1)) // 2**
