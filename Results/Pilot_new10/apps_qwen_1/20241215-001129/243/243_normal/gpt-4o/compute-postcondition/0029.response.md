The code `result = list(range(left + 1, right))` creates a list of integers starting from `left + 1` up to `right - 1`. Let's break down the values of `left` and `right`:

- `left` is defined as \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k\)
- `right` is defined as \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + (number of loop executions - 1)\)

Since the number of loop executions is not specified, let's denote it as `loop_executions`. So, `right` becomes \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + (loop_executions - 1)\).

After executing the line of code, `result` will be updated to the range from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `result` is now the list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `result` is the list of integers from \(((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k) + 1\) to \(((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + (loop_executions - 1)) - 1\); `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\); `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)'`; `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k\); `right` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + (loop_executions - 1)\)**
