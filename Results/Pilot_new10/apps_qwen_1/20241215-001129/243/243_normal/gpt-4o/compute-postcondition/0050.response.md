Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is that `right` has been increased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `func_1(right) == m`.

3. **Requirement for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must be true at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Current Value of `right`**: Since `right` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `right` as `right_new = right + 1`.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again**: To ensure the loop executes again, we need `func_1(right_new) == m` to be true. This means that `func_1(right + 1) == m` must hold true.

6. **Adjusting the State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `func_1(right + 1) == m` holds true at the start of the next iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state needs to be adjusted such that `func_1(right + 1) == m` must be true at the start of the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`func_1(right + 1)` must be equal to `m`**
