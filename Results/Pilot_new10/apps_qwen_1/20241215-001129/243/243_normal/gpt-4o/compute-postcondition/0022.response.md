Let's break down the conditions under which the `while` loop will execute:

The `while` loop condition is `func_1(right) == m`.

Given the current state:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\).
- `result` is an empty list.
- `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\).
- `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`.
- `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k\).
- `right` is `mid + 1`.

For the loop to execute, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`.

Right before the loop, we have:
- `right` is `mid + 1`.

To satisfy the condition `func_1(right) == m`, we need to ensure that `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`.

Since `mid` is already defined as \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\), the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is:
- Ensure that `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`.

The final state right before the loop, adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, is:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\); `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`; `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k\); `right` is `mid + 1` and `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`**
