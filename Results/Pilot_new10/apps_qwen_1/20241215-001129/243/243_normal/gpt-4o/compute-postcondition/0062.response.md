The code snippet updates the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. This means that `low` is now `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged based on the given conditions.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` if `zeroes > m`, `mid` is now \((low + high) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` in the else part, and `left` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration.**
