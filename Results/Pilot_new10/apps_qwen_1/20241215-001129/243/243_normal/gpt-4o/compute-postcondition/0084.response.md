Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\). If `zeroes < m`, then `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `mid - 1`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` if `zeroes > m`, `mid` is now \((low + high) // 2\), and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `left` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration. If `zeroes >= m`, then `low` and `high` are updated according to the condition on `zeroes` and `m`. Specifically, if `zeroes > m`, then `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `mid - 1`, and `high` becomes `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `right` is determined as the smallest integer greater than \((low + high) // 2 + 1\) where `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, and `func_1(right - 1)` equals `m`. `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` in both cases, and `mid` is now \((low + high) // 2\).***
