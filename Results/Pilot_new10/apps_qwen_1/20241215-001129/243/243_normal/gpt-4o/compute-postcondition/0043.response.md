`left` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, `low` is less than `high`, `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 1\), `zeroes` is equal to `m`, and `result` is an empty list. The value of `high` and `right` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` must be less than `high`, `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(left)` and must be equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `high` and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration.**
