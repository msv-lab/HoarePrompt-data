`zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. The function `func_1` is called with `mid` as an argument, which is \((low + high) // 2\). The values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `result`, `left`, and `right` are updated accordingly. The initial conditions for `low` being less than `high` and `1 \leq m \leq 100,000` remain valid.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` must be less than `high`; `mid` is updated to \((low + high) // 2\); `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; all other variables (`result`, `left`, `right`) remain as they are after the last iteration.**
