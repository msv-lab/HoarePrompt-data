The code `low = mid + 1` changes the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. From the initial state, we know that `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `low` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1`.

The states of the other variables (`high`, `result`, `mid`, and `zeroes`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100,000; `low` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1`; `high` is 5 * (m + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (m + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is func_1(mid), and `zeroes` is less than `m`**
