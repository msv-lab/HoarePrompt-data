The code initializes `result` as an empty list. This means that the list `result` is now empty, but no changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (m + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is func_1(mid); `zeroes` is less than or equal to m**
