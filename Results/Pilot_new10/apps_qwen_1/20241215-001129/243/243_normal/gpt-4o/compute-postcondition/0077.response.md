`right` is incremented by 1. The function `func_1(right)` was previously equal to `m`, so after incrementing `right` by 1, the new value of `right` will be such that `func_1(right)` is no longer equal to `m`, but we don't know its exact value.

Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `right` is such that `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`.**
