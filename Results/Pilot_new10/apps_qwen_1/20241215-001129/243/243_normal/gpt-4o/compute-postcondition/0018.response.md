Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `while func_1(left) == m:`. For the loop to continue executing, `func_1(left)` must not equal `m`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
   - `low` is 0
   - `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\)
   - `result` is an empty list
   - `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\)
   - `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`
   - `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 2\)
   - `func_1(left)` must not be equal to `m`

3. **Identify Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must not be equal to `m`. Since the condition `func_1(left) == m` is checked in the while loop, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m` after the adjustment.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to change the state such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`. This means that `func_1(left)` should be set to a value different from `m`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `m` remains the same as it was before the loop.
   - `low` remains 0.
   - `high` remains \(5 \times (m + 1)\).
   - `result` remains an empty list.
   - `mid` remains \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\).
   - `zeroes` remains `func_1(mid)`.
   - `left` remains \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 2\).
   - Ensure `func_1(left)` is different from `m`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\), `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`, `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 2\), and `func_1(left)` must be different from `m`**
