The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Initially, `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 1\). After decrementing, the new value of `left` will be \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 2\).

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\), `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`, `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 2\), and `func_1(left)` must not be equal to `m`**
