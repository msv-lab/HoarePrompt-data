`right` is incremented by 1. The function call `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`, but since the function itself is not defined and does not affect the value of `m`, the value of `m` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`; `right` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`; `right` is increased by 1**
