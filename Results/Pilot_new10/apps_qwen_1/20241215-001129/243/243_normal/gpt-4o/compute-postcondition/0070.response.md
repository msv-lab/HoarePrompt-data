To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions under which the loop continues.

### Given Information:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration.
- `left = (low + high) // 2 - 2`.
- The condition `func_1(left) == m`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`.

### Current State:
- `m` is an integer in the range \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `left` is calculated as \((low + high) // 2 - 2\).
- The function `func_1(left)` returns the value of `m`.

### Analysis:
For the loop to continue, `func_1(left)` must return the same value as `m`. Therefore, the state of `left` needs to be adjusted such that `func_1(left)` still returns `m`.

Since the loop is based on the condition `func_1(left) == m`, no specific adjustments are needed to `m`, `low`, or `high` for the loop to continue, as long as `left` is recalculated correctly within the constraints of the loop.

However, since `left` is derived from `low` and `high`, we need to ensure that the calculation of `left` remains valid and that `func_1(left)` still equals `m`. This means that the values of `low` and `high` should not change in a way that would cause `left` to no longer satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:
No specific state needs to be adjusted beyond ensuring that `left` is recalculated correctly. Since `left` is derived from `low` and `high`, and the loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`, the only thing we need to ensure is that the relationship between `low`, `high`, and `left` holds true.

Thus, the state at the end of the previous iteration is sufficient for the loop to proceed.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration, `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 2\), and `func_1(left) == m`**
