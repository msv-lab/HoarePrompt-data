The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Since `n` is initially 1, which is not divisible by 5 (`1 // 5` results in 0), the condition `if n // 5` is not met, and thus no change occurs to `count`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `count` remains 0, and `n` is 1.**
