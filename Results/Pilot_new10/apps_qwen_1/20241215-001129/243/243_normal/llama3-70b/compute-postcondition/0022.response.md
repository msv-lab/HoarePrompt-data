Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `count` is the largest integer such that \(5^{\text{count}} \leq \frac{n}{m}\) and \(5^{\text{count}+1} > \frac{n}{m}\), `n` is 1, `ans` is an empty list, and if the current value of \(n // 5^{\text{count}}\) is less than `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
