Output State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `count` is the largest integer such that \(5^{\text{count}} \leq \frac{n}{m}\) and \(5^{\text{count}+1} > \frac{n}{m}\), `n` is the final value of `n` after all iterations of the loop, `ans` is a list containing all integers from 1 up to and including `n`.**
