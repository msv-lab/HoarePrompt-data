`m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `m` now holds the integer value input by the user. The precondition that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000` remains valid.

Output State: **`m` is the integer value entered by the user and satisfies 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000.**
