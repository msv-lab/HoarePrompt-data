The code `break` does not change any variable values and is used to exit a loop or match statement. Given the initial state where `m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `count` remains 0, and `n` is 1, the `break` statement simply exits the loop or match without affecting these variables.

Output State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `count` remains 0, and `n` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or match statement.**
