Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Objective of the Problem**: The problem requires finding the number of positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial of \( n \) ends with exactly \( m \) zeroes. 

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses a loop to find the highest power of 5 that fits the condition \( 5^{\text{count}} \leq \frac{n}{m} \) and \( 5^{\text{count}+1} > \frac{n}{m} \). However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't directly relate to counting the number of trailing zeroes in factorials.
   - After finding this count, the code attempts to append all integers from 1 to \( n \) into the list `ans`, which is incorrect. The goal is to identify specific values of \( n \) where the factorial ends with exactly \( m \) zeroes, not all integers from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of \( n \) using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Trailing Zeroes} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
     \]
   - We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the above expression equals \( m \). Once we find this \( n \), we can determine the range of \( n \) values for which the number of trailing zeroes is exactly \( m \).

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The program should first determine the starting point \( n_0 \) such that the number of trailing zeroes is at least \( m \).
   - Then, check for the range of \( n \) values where the number of trailing zeroes is exactly \( m \).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    n = 1
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count >= m:
            break
        count += 1
    
    start_n = 0
    current_zeros = 0
    while current_zeros < m:
        current_zeros = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            current_zeros += i // 5 ** count
        if current_zeros == m:
            start_n = n
        n += 1
    
    end_n = start_n
    while True:
        current_zeros = 0
        for i in range(1, end_n + 1):
            current_zeros += i // 5 ** count
        if current_zeros > m:
            break
        end_n += 1
    
    num_values = end_n - start_n
    print(num_values)
    for i in range(start_n, end_n):
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()

func()
```

This implementation correctly finds the range of \( n \) values where the factorial ends with exactly \( m \) zeroes and prints the correct output.
