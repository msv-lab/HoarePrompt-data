Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `count`**: The variable `count` is intended to represent the highest power of 5 whose factorial contributes to the trailing zeroes. However, the logic to calculate `count` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if n // 5 ** count >= m:` should be `if n // 5 ** count >= 1:` to ensure we are counting the number of multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., up to `n`.

2. **Incorrect Generation of `ans`**: The list `ans` is populated incorrectly. The loop should continue generating numbers until the factorial no longer ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The current implementation simply appends numbers from 1 up to and including the last valid `n`, which does not guarantee that the factorial of each number in the list ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- For `m = 1`, the correct answer should be `5, 6, 7, 8, 9`. However, the provided code will not generate these numbers correctly because it does not properly calculate the `count` and generate the valid range of `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    n = 1
    while n // 5 ** count >= 1:
        count += 1
    count -= 1  # Adjust count to get the correct power of 5

    ans = []
    n = 1
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count < m:
            break
        if n // 5 ** count == m:
            ans.append(n)
        n += 1
    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))

func()
```

This corrected code ensures that `count` is calculated correctly and that the list `ans` is generated properly, ensuring that the factorial of each number in `ans` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
