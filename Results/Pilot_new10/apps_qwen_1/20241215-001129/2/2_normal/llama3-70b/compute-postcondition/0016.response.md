The code assigns the value of `digit_sum` to `max_sum`. Since `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `prev_i + 2`, `max_sum` now holds this value. The variables `i` and `max_num` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `prev_i + 2`, `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `prev_i + 2`, `max_sum` is `digit_sum`, `max_num` remains unchanged**
