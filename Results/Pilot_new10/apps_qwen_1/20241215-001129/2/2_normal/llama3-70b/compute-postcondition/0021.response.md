The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. The input is a string representing a positive integer `x` such that `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the provided output cases.

Given the constraints and the lack of a specific return value in the output cases, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string input representing a positive integer `x` within the range 1 to 10^18 (inclusive) and does not return any value.**
