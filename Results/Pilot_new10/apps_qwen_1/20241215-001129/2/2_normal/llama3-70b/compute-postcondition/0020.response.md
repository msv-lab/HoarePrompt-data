The code `print(max_num)` simply prints the value of `max_num` without changing its value or any other variables. The other variables `x` and `max_sum` remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`x` is the final integer value within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\); `max_sum` is the maximum digit sum encountered during the loop; `max_num` is printed.**
