The code calculates the sum of digits of the integer `i` and assigns it to the variable `digit_sum`. The value of `i` is unchanged and remains between 1 and \(10^{18}\). Let's denote the sum of the digits of `i` as `digit_sum`.

- `i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\); `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i`.**
