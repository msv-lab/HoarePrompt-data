According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to \(x + 1\). The loop body processes each number \(i\) to update `digit_sum`, `max_sum`, and `max_num` if necessary.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of the current value of `i`.
- If `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` equals `digit_sum` and `max_num` equals `i`; otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` will be processed. Since the loop iterates through integers starting from 1 up to \(x + 1\), the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Let's summarize the states that need to be adjusted:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`.
- `digit_sum` needs to be recalculated for the new value of `i + 1`.
- `max_sum` and `max_num` will remain unchanged unless the new `digit_sum` for `i + 1` is greater than `max_sum`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 1`, `max_sum` must be equal to the maximum sum found so far, and `max_num` must be equal to the corresponding number found so far**.
