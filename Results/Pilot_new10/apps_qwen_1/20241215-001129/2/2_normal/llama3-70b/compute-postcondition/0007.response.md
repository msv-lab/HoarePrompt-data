`max_num` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `digit_sum` and `max_sum` remains unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment. The variable `i` now holds the value stored in `max_num`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i`, `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`, `max_num` is equal to `i`.**
