You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Anton has the integer x. He is interested what positive integer, which doesn't exceed x, has the maximum sum of digits.

Your task is to help Anton and to find the integer that interests him. If there are several such integers, determine the biggest of them. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the integer which Anton has. 


-----Output-----

Print the positive integer which doesn't exceed x and has the maximum sum of digits. If there are several such integers, print the biggest of them. Printed integer must not contain leading zeros.


-----Examples-----
Input
100

Output
99

Input
48

Output
48

Input
521

Output
499
Program:
```
x = int(input().strip())
x_str = str(x)
n = len(x_str)
if x_str[0] != '1':
    candidate = int(x_str[0]) - 1
    candidate = str(candidate) + '9' * (n - 1)
else:
    candidate = '9' * (n - 1)
candidate = int(candidate)
sum_x = func_1(x)
sum_candidate = func_1(candidate)
if sum_candidate > sum_x:
    print(candidate)
else:
    print(x)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input `x` is composed entirely of the digit '1'. In such cases, the program generates a candidate number that does not maximize the sum of digits. For example, consider the input `x = 111`. The correct output should be `999`, but the program will generate `999` only if the first digit is not '1', which is not the case here. 

To fix this, the program needs to check if the input `x` is composed entirely of the digit '1' and handle this special case separately. Here's a corrected version:

```python
x = int(input().strip())
x_str = str(x)
n = len(x_str)

# Check if the input is composed entirely of '1'
if x_str == '1' * n:
    candidate = int('9' * n)
else:
    # Generate the candidate number
    candidate = int(x_str[0]) - 1
    candidate = str(candidate) + '9' * (n - 1)

# Ensure the candidate does not exceed x
if int(candidate) > x:
    candidate = x

print(candidate)
```

This version ensures that the program handles the special case where the input is composed entirely of the digit '1'.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\), converts `n` to a string to access each digit, sums the integer values of these digits, and returns the resulting sum. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
