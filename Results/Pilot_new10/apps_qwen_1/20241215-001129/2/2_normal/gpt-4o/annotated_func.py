#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer n, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\), converts `n` to a string to access each digit, sums the integer values of these digits, and returns the resulting sum.
