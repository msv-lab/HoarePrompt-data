The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to variables `k` and `l`. The previous values of `i`, `n`, `f`, and `days` are not affected. Since the input values are not specified, they will be represented as `k` and `l`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `f` is an integer such that 0 ≤ f ≤ n, `days` is an empty list, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**
