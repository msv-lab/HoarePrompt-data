Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is an integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), `days` is a list containing `n` tuples \([(k_1, l_1), (k_2, l_2), \ldots, (k_n, l_n)]\), where each \((k_i, l_i)\) is a tuple of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for \(n\) iterations, appending a tuple \((k, l)\) to the `days` list in each iteration.
- After \(n\) iterations, the value of `i` will be `n`.
- The condition `1 \leq n \leq 10^5` ensures that the loop will run at most 100,000 times.
- The value of `f` remains unchanged throughout the loop since it is not modified within the loop.
- The `days` list will contain exactly `n` tuples, each representing the input values \((k, l)\) from the user.

If the loop does not execute, it means that the value of `n` is 0. In this case:
- `i` will still be 0.
- `n` will be 0.
- `f` will be an integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq 0\), meaning `f` can only be 0.
- `days` will remain an empty list.
