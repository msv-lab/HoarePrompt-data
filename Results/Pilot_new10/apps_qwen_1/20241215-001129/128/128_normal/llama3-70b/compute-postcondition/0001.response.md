The code `days = []` creates an empty list named `days`. This operation does not affect the values of `n` or `f`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `days` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `f` is an integer such that 0 ≤ f ≤ n, `days` is an empty list**
