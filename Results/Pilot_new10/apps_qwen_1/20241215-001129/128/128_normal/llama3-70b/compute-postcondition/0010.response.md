`days` is a list of tuples, and each tuple contains two integers `(k, l)`. The code appends a new tuple `(k, l)` to the list `days`. The values of `i`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is an integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), `days` is now `[ (k, l), (k, l), (k, l) ]`, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**
