The code reads two integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `k` and `l`. This means that the values of `i`, `n`, `f`, and `days` remain unchanged. The values of `k` and `l` are assigned the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is an integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), `days` is now `[ (k, l), (k, l) ]`, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**
