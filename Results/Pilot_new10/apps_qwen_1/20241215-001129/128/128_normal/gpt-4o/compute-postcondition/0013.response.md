The code sorts the `potential_sales_increase` list in descending order. The original values of `potential_sales_increase` are derived from `days`, but the specific values are not given. However, the sort operation does not change the sum of the elements or the fact that `days` remains unchanged. The `total_sales` remains the same as well.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), `days` is an empty list, `regular_sales` is a list of length `n`, where each element is `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` for \(0 \leq i < n\), `potential_sales_increase` is a list of length `n`, where each element is sorted in descending order, and `total_sales` is the sum of `regular_sales`.**
