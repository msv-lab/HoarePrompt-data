The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. 

- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `f` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\).
- `days` is a list of \(n\) tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers \(k_i\) and \(l_i\) such that \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\), representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients for the i-th day, respectively.

The function calculates `total_sales` which is the sum of `regular_sales` (sum of the first `n` elements of a list derived from `days`) and the sum of the first `f` elements of `potential_sales_increase` (a list derived from `days`).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `f`, and `days`, and return `total_sales` which is the sum of `regular_sales` and the sum of the first `f` elements of `potential_sales_increase`.
