Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), `days` is an empty list, `regular_sales` is a list of length `n`, where each element is `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` for \(0 \leq i < n\), `potential_sales_increase` is a list of length `n`, where each element is `min(2 * days[i][0], days[i][1]) - min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` for \(0 \leq i < n\).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each tuple `(k, l)` in the `days` list.
- For each iteration, it appends `min(k, l)` to `regular_sales` and `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` to `potential_sales_increase`.
- After the loop completes, all elements in `days` will have been processed, resulting in `days` becoming an empty list since each tuple is consumed during the loop.
- The length of both `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase` lists will be `n`, with each element corresponding to the result of the operations performed in the loop for each day.
- Since the loop processes each day exactly once and stops when there are no more days left, `n` will be reduced to 0 by the end of the loop, making `days` an empty list.
