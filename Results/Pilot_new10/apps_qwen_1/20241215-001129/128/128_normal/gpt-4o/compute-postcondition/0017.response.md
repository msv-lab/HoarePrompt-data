Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), and `days` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers `k_i` and `l_i` such that \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\). The function calculates `total_sales` as the sum of `regular_sales` and the sum of the first `f` elements of `potential_sales_increase`. `regular_sales` is computed as the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` for each day, while `potential_sales_increase` is computed as the difference between the minimum of twice `k_i` and `l_i` and the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` for each day. The function returns `total_sales`.**
