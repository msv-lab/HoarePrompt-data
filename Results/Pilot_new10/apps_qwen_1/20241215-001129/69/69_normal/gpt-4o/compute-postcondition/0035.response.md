Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is either 0 or 1; `y` is either 0 or 1; `i` must be less than `n`; if `op == 'U'`, `final_y` is increased by 1; if `op == 'D'`, `final_y` is -1 if it was 0 and 0 if it was 1; if `op == 'L'`, `final_x` is decreased by 1; if `op == 'R'`, `final_x` is increased by 1; and if `op` is neither 'L' nor 'R', `final_x` remains unchanged.***
