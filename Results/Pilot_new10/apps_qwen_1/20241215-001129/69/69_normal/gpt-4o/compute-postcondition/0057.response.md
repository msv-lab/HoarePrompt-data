The code `current_x += 1` increments the value of `current_x` by 1. Given that the initial value of `current_x` is 0, after this operation, `current_x` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged based on the precondition.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `min_length` is `inf`, `current_x` is 1, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1}`, `operations[i]` is 'R', the current value of `dx` is 1**
