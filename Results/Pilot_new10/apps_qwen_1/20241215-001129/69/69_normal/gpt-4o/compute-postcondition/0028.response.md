`final_y` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `final_y` is not specified in the initial state. The values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is either 0 or 1; `y` is either 0 or 1; `i` must be less than `n`; `final_y` is increased by 1.
