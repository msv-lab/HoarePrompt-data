Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is either -1 or 0, `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, `position_map` is updated such that the key `(current_x, current_y)` maps to the value `i + 1`, and `current_x` is adjusted according to the operation 'L' or 'R': if `operations[i] == 'L'`, `current_x` is decreased by 1; if `operations[i] == 'R'`, `current_x` is set to the value determined by the operation at index `i+1` in `operations`.***
