Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is either 0 or 1, and `y` is either 0 or 1. If the next operation `op` is 'U', then `y` is set to 1. If `op` is 'D', then `y` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `x` remains 0. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `operations` remain unchanged.***
