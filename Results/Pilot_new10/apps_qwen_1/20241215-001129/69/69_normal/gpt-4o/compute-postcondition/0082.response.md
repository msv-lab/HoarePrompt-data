The code `current_y -= 1` decrements the value of `current_y` by 1. The previous value of `current_y` could be -1, 0, or 1 depending on the operations at index `i+1` in `operations`. After decrementing, the new value of `current_y` will be -2 if it was 1, 0 if it was 1 and became -1, or -1 if it was -1 or 0.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `x` remains the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0.
- `y` remains the net change in the vertical position starting from 0.
- `final_x` remains `x`.
- `final_y` remains `y`.
- `dx` remains 0.
- `dy` remains either -1 or 0.
- `current_x` remains either -1, 0, or 1 depending on the operations at index `i+1` in `operations`.
- `target_pos` remains the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`.
- `position_map` remains updated such that the key `(current_x, current_y)` maps to the value `i + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0; `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0; `final_x` is `x`; `final_y` is `y`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is either -1 or 0; `current_x` and `current_y` are either -1, 0, or 1 depending on the operations at index `i+1` in `operations`; `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `position_map` is updated such that the key `(current_x, current_y)` maps to the value `i + 1`; `current_y` is decremented by 1.
