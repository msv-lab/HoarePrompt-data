The code `current_y = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `current_y`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5
- `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters
- `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0
- `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0
- `final_x` is `x`
- `final_y` is `y`
- `dx` is 0
- `dy` is 0
- `min_length` is `inf`
- `current_x` is 0
- `current_y` is 0

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `min_length` is `inf`, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is 0**
