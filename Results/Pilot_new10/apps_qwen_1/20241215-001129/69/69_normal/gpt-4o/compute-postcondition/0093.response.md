Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is either -1 or 0, `min_length` is the minimum distance between any repeated configuration of `(current_x, current_y)`, `current_x` is the final horizontal position, `current_y` is the final vertical position, `position_map` is a dictionary where each key is a position `(current_x, current_y)` and each value is the index `i` where the position was last updated, `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)` and is checked against the `position_map` during each iteration.**
