The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This means that the previous values of `x` and `y` are replaced by these new integer values. The values of `n` and `ops` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `ops` is a string of operations, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ y ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are replaced by the integers entered in the input.**
