Let's break down the given information and determine what states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `ops` is a string of operations (each operation is presumably one character)
- `x` is an integer such that \(-10^9 \leq x \leq 10^9\)
- `y` is an integer such that \(-10^9 \leq y \leq 10^9\)
- `ux` is 0
- `uy` is 0
- `lx` is 0
- `ly` is 0

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for op in ops:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters in the `ops` string. The loop will stop when `ops` becomes an empty string.
   
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` are all set to 0. These values might be modified inside the loop, but they don't directly affect whether the loop can start or continue.
   - `n` is an integer with a specific range, but this does not impact the loop condition directly.
   - `x` and `y` are integers with a specific range, but they do not directly influence the loop condition either.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute as long as `ops` is non-empty. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `ops` is non-empty.

### Final Answer:
State: **`ops` is a non-empty string**
