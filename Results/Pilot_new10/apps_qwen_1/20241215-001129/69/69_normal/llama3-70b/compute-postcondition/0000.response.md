`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The string and the integers `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, the string consists of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' characters representing operations, and x, y are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`**
