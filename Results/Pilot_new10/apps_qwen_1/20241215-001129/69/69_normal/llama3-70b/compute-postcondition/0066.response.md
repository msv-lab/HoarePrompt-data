`dx` is incremented by 1. The initial state shows that `dx` is adjusted based on the operation and its conditions, but the exact value of `dx` is not specified. Since `dx` is adjusted based on the operation and its conditions, the new value of `dx` will be the original value plus 1. The states of the other variables (`ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `dy`, `res`) are not affected.

Output State: **`dx` is adjusted based on the operation and its conditions plus 1, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 1 if the operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, otherwise `res` is 0**
