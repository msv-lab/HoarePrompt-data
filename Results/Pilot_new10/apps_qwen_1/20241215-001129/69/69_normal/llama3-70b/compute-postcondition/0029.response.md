According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `ops`. Depending on the value of `op`, either `uy` or `ux` is modified.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `ops` is a non-empty string.
- `uy` and `ux` are integers.
- The modification rules for `uy` and `ux` based on the value of `op`.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- The loop will continue if there are more characters in `ops` to process.
- Since `ops` is a non-empty string, it will have at least one character left to process unless we reach the end of the string.

Let's break down the steps:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `ops` is still a non-empty string.
2. `uy` and `ux` have been updated according to the rule associated with the previous `op`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character in `ops`.

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `ops` still contains at least one more character, and `uy` and `ux` remain as they were updated in the previous iteration.

State: **`ops` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `uy` is as previously updated, `ux` is as previously updated**.
