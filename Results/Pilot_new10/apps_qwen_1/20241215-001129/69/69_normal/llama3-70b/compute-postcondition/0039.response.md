The code `dx, dy = x - ux, y - uy` assigns the value of `x - ux` to `dx` and the value of `y - uy` to `dy`. The values of `ux` and `uy` remain unchanged. Since `x` and `y` are not defined in the initial state, we will use `ux` and `uy` as placeholders for their respective values.

The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `ops` is a non-empty string
- `uy` is the net change in the y-coordinate (initially 0)
- `ux` is the net change in the x-coordinate (initially 0)

After executing the code:
- `dx` is assigned the value `x - ux`
- `dy` is assigned the value `y - uy`

Since `x` and `y` are not specified, we keep them as placeholders. The values of `ux` and `uy` remain as they were initially.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`**
