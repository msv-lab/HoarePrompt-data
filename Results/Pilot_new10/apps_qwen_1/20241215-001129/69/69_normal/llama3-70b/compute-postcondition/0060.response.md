Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is adjusted based on the operation and its conditions, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 1 if the operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, otherwise `res` is 0. If the operation is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, `dx` is decremented by 1. If the condition `op == 'D' and dy < 0` is true, then `dy` is set to 0.***
