Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is adjusted based on the operation and its conditions, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 1 if the operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, otherwise `res` is 2.***

This postcondition covers all the possible outcomes from both the if and else parts, ensuring that the final state of the program variables (`ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `res`) is accurately described based on the given conditions.
