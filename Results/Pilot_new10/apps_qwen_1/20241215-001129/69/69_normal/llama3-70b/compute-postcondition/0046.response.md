`dy` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `dy` is greater than 0 and it is now reduced by 1, `dy` will be a positive value that is 1 less than its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy - 1`, `res` is 0, both `dx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dy` is greater than 0**
