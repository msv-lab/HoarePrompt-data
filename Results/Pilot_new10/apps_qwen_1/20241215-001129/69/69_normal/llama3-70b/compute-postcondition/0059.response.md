Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux` adjusted based on the operation, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 1 if the operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0 after adjustment, otherwise `res` is 0. If the operation is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, `dx` is decremented by 1.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering all the specified cases.
