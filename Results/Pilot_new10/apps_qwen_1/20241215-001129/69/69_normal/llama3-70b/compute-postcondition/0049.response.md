The code `dy += 1` increments the value of `dy` by 1. Given the initial state where `dy` is less than 0, after this operation, `dy` will become `-1 + 1 = 0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is 0, `res` is 0, the operation `op` is 'D', `dy` is 0**
