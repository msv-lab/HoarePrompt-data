Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `uy` is the net change in the y-coordinate (initially 0), `ux` is the net change in the x-coordinate (initially 0).** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each operation in the string `ops`.
- For each operation:
  - If the operation is 'U', `uy` is incremented by 1.
  - If the operation is 'D', `uy` is decremented by 1.
  - If the operation is 'R', `ux` is incremented by 1.
  - If the operation is 'L', `ux` is decremented by 1.
- After all iterations of the loop, `uy` will represent the total net change in the y-coordinate starting from 0, and `ux` will represent the total net change in the x-coordinate starting from 0.
- The variable `ops` must be a non-empty string for the loop to execute at least once. If `ops` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and the values of `uy` and `ux` will remain 0.
