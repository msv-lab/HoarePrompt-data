The code `ux += 1` increments the value of `ux` by 1. The initial state of `ux` is not specified, but it is a variable that holds an integer value. The next operation `op` can be 'U', 'D', 'R', or 'L', which does not affect `ux`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `ops` is a non-empty string, `op` can be 'U', 'D', 'R', or 'L', and `ux` is its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` can be 'U', 'D', 'R', or 'L', `ux` is its previous value plus 1**
