Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it's possible to light up at least one garland every second after switching them on by checking the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the intervals. If the GCD of the three intervals is 1, it means that the intervals are coprime and it's possible to cover all seconds after a certain point. Otherwise, it's not possible. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the logic is sound for any input values within the specified range.
