Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) is flawed. The formula used in the program is not correct for calculating the LCM of three numbers. Additionally, the function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD), but it is incorrectly used in the context of finding the LCM.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
2 2 3
```

The expected output should be "YES" because Mishka can choose the same moment for all three garlands, e.g., \(x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 1\). However, the current implementation may fail to recognize this case due to the incorrect LCM calculation.

Another counterexample is:
```
4 2 3
```

Here, the expected output is "NO", as there is no combination of moments that would ensure all seconds are covered. The program may incorrectly output "YES" due to the faulty LCM calculation.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it's possible to light all garlands at least once per second after turning them on, making the program incorrect.
