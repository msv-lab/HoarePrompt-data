Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used to determine if Mishka can light at least one garland every second relies on calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the time intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. However, the method used to calculate the LCM is flawed and incorrect.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect LCM Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the LCM using a naive approach involving the product of the numbers divided by their pairwise GCDs, but this is not the correct way to compute the LCM. The LCM should be calculated directly using the relationship between GCD and LCM: \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \). For three numbers, it's better to use the following formula: \( \text{lcm}(a, b, c) = \text{lcm}(\text{lcm}(a, b), c) \).

2. **Incorrect Condition Check**: Even if the LCM were calculated correctly, the condition check `if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):` is also flawed. This condition checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the time intervals, which is not sufficient to ensure that at least one garland is lit every second. Instead, we need to check if the LCM is less than or equal to the maximum interval among `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we should:
1. Calculate the LCM of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` correctly.
2. Check if the LCM is less than or equal to the maximum of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)

(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
max_interval = max(k1, k2, k3)
lcm_value = lcm(lcm(k1, k2), k3)

if lcm_value <= max_interval:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

This solution ensures that we correctly compute the LCM and check if it is feasible for at least one garland to be lit every second.
