Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program indeed contains a flaw in its logic for calculating the least common multiple (LCM). Although the `func_1` function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD), it is used incorrectly in the context of calculating the LCM. The formula used in the program for calculating `lcm` is not correct. Specifically, the formula `lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))` is incorrect for finding the LCM of three numbers. The correct approach would involve using the relationship between GCD and LCM, which is `lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) // gcd(a, b)` for two numbers, extended to three numbers as `lcm(a, b, c) = lcm(lcm(a, b), c)`.

Given the annotated version of the code, it clearly shows that the `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD, but the use of this function in calculating the LCM is incorrect. Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results for many inputs, making it incorrect based on the problem description.
