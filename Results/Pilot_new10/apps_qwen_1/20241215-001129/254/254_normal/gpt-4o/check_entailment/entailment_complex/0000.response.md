Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to determine whether Mishka can switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second does not align with the problem's constraints and examples provided.

### Why it is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Solution:**
   - The program calculates the GCD of \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\).
   - It prints 'YES' if the GCD is 1, and 'NO' otherwise.
   - This logic does not correctly determine if Mishka can switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second. 

2. **Example Analysis:**
   - **Example 1:** For the input `2 2 3`, the GCD is 1, and the program outputs 'YES'. However, as explained in the problem note, Mishka can indeed achieve his goal by choosing appropriate initial times for switching on the garlands (e.g., \(x_1 = 1\), \(x_2 = 2\), \(x_3 = 1\)). This suggests that the GCD being 1 is sufficient but not necessary for the solution.

   - **Example 2:** For the input `4 2 3`, the GCD is 1, and the program outputs 'NO'. However, based on the problem statement, the correct answer should be 'NO' because no matter what initial times are chosen, there will always be some seconds when no garland is lit.

3. **General Case Explanation:**
   - The problem requires that at least one garland must be lit every second after they are turned on. The solution should involve finding a combination of initial times \(x_1, x_2, x_3\) such that the union of the lit periods of the garlands covers all subsequent seconds.
   - Simply checking the GCD of the periods does not ensure this coverage. For instance, if \(k_1 = 4\), \(k_2 = 2\), and \(k_3 = 3\), the GCD is 1, but the periods overlap in a way that ensures coverage (i.e., every second is covered).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should find a combination of initial times \(x_1, x_2, x_3\) such that the union of the intervals \([x_1, x_1 + k_1, x_1 + 2k_1, ...]\), \([x_2, x_2 + k_2, x_2 + 2k_2, ...]\), and \([x_3, x_3 + k_3, x_3 + 2k_3, ...]\) covers all integers greater than or equal to the maximum of \(x_1, x_2, x_3\).

In summary, the program fails to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
