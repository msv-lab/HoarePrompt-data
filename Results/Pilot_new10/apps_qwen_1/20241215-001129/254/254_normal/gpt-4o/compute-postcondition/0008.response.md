The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the conditions provided, but since no specific output or conditions are given in the problem statement other than the constraints on `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3`, we can only state that the function returns some value without specifying what that value is.

Functionality: **The function returns a value.**
