The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `k1` and `k2` using `math.gcd(k1, k2)`. This means `gcd_k1_k2` is assigned the GCD of `k1` and `k2`. The values of `k1` and `k2` are read from input, and `k3` remains unchanged.

Since the exact values of `k1` and `k2` are not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `gcd_k1_k2`. However, we know that `gcd_k1_k2` will be the GCD of the two integers read from input, and `k3` remains as initially read from input.

Output State: **`gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k1` and `k2`; `k1` is an integer read from input, `k2` is an integer read from input, `k3` is an integer read from input**
