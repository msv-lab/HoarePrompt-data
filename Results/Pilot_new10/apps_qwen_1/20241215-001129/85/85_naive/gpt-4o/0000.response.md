Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to calculate the number of pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. However, it fails to correctly handle the case when `n` itself is a power of 10 minus 1 (e.g., 9, 99, 999, etc.). In such cases, the program incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs.

For example, consider the input `n = 9`:
- The maximum number of nines at the end is 1 (since 9 + 9 = 18, which ends with 1 eight).
- The program should output 1, as the only valid pair is (1, 8).

However, the program calculates:
- `max_9s` as 1 (since 9 % 10 == 0).
- `pairs` as `(n + 1) * max_9s = 10 * 1 = 10`, which is incorrect.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not handle cases where `n` itself is a power of 10 minus 1 correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
