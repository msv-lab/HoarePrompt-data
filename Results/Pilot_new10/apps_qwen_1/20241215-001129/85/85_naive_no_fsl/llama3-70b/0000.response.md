Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the condition `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0` is checking if the sum of the pair of shovels ends with a number of nines that matches the length of the sum string minus one. This condition is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of trailing nines.

For example, consider `n = 50`. The correct output should be `1`, as the pair of shovels with indices 49 and 50 (costing 49 and 50 burles respectively) will result in a total cost of 99, which ends with two nines. However, the current program does not account for this scenario correctly.

To fix this, the program needs to determine the highest power of 10 that divides the sum of the shovels' costs. The correct approach would involve finding the highest power of 10 that divides the difference between the maximum possible sum (which is `n + (n-1)` for the pair with the highest indices) and then checking each pair to see if it meets this condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    # Find the maximum number of trailing nines
    while n > 0 and n % 10 == 0:
        n //= 10
        max_nines += 1
    
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        sum_cost = i + (n - i)
        if sum_cost % 10 ** max_nines == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program checks for the maximum number of trailing nines correctly.
