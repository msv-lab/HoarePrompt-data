You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.

Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.

You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 

Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

It is guaranteed that for every n ≤ 10^9 the answer doesn't exceed 2·10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
3

Input
14

Output
9

Input
50

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose:  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5. 

In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp:  1 and 8;  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5;  5 and 14;  6 and 13;  7 and 12;  8 and 11;  9 and 10. 

In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the condition `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0` is checking if the sum of the pair of shovels ends with a number of nines that matches the length of the sum string minus one. This condition is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of trailing nines.

For example, consider `n = 50`. The correct output should be `1`, as the pair of shovels with indices 49 and 50 (costing 49 and 50 burles respectively) will result in a total cost of 99, which ends with two nines. However, the current program does not account for this scenario correctly.

To fix this, the program needs to determine the highest power of 10 that divides the sum of the shovels' costs. The correct approach would involve finding the highest power of 10 that divides the difference between the maximum possible sum (which is `n + (n-1)` for the pair with the highest indices) and then checking each pair to see if it meets this condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    # Find the maximum number of trailing nines
    while n > 0 and n % 10 == 0:
        n //= 10
        max_nines += 1
    
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        sum_cost = i + (n - i)
        if sum_cost % 10 ** max_nines == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program checks for the maximum number of trailing nines correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function reads an integer `n` within the range 2 to \(10^9\) from user input, and counts the number of integers `i` (from 1 to \(n//2\)) for which \((i + (n - i))\) is divisible by \(10\) raised to the power of the number of digits in \((i + (n - i))\) minus one. The function then prints the count of such integers. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
