`ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 0, so after executing `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` becomes 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1**
