The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it. Therefore, the output state is that `ans` is 0 and `n` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 0**
