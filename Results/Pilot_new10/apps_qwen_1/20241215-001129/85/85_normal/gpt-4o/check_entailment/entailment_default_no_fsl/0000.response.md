Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for counting the number of pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines is flawed. The code incorrectly calculates the number of such pairs by simply multiplying \( (n + 1) \) with the number of trailing 9s in \( n \).

To illustrate, let's consider the example from the problem statement:

- For \( n = 7 \), the maximum number of trailing nines is 0. The correct pairs are (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5). The total cost for each pair is 9, 9, and 9 respectively, which ends with one nine. However, the code incorrectly outputs 3.
- For \( n = 14 \), the maximum number of trailing nines is 1. The correct pairs are (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 14), (6, 13), (7, 12), (8, 11), and (9, 10). The total cost for each pair is 9, 9, 9, 9, 19, 19, 19, 19, and 19 respectively. However, the code incorrectly outputs 9.
- For \( n = 50 \), the maximum number of trailing nines is 1. The only correct pair is (49, 50) with a total cost of 99, which ends with two nines. However, the code incorrectly outputs 1.

The correct approach involves finding the highest power of 10 that divides the difference between consecutive numbers and then calculating the valid pairs accordingly. The provided code does not implement this logic correctly.
