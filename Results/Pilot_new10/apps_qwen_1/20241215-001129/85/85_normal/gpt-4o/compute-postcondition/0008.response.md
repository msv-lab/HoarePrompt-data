According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. This expression checks if adding 1 to `n` results in a number that ends in 0, meaning `n` ends in 9.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` does not end in 9 and `max_9s` has been increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must end in 9 after the adjustment.

To satisfy the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, `n` must be such that when 1 is added to it, the result ends in 0. This means `n` must end in 9.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` ends in 9.

State: **`n` must end in 9; `max_9s` is increased by 1**
