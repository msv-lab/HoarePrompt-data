Let's analyze the annotated code step by step to determine the functionality of the function.

1. The function starts by taking an integer input `n` from the user, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
2. It initializes `max_9s` to 0.
3. The while loop runs as long as `(n + 1) \% 10 == 0`, which means it continues as long as `n` ends in a 9.
4. Inside the loop, `max_9s` is incremented each time a trailing 9 is removed from `n` by performing `n //= 10`.
5. After the loop, `n` is no longer divisible by 10, meaning it no longer ends in a 9.
6. The variable `pairs` is calculated as \((n + 1) * max_9s\).
7. The result is printed.

Now, let's summarize the functionality:

- The function takes an integer input `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- It counts the number of trailing 9s in `n` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 10 until it no longer ends in a 9.
- It then calculates `pairs` as \((n + 1) * max_9s\).
- Finally, it prints the value of `pairs`.

Functionality: **The function takes an integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)), counts the number of trailing 9s in `n`, and prints the result of \((n + 1) * max_9s\).**
