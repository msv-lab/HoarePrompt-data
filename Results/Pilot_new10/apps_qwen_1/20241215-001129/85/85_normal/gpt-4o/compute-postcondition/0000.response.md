`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The value of `n` is now the integer input from the user, and the condition `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9` must still be satisfied. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; other variables are unchanged**
