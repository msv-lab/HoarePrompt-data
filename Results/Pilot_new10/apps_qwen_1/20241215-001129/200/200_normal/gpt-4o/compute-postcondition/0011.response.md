The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without executing the code outside the loop body. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, we can infer that this `continue` statement is part of a loop structure that would normally continue iterating over the `volumes` list. However, since the loop structure is not explicitly shown, we focus on the variables that are affected or unaffected by the `continue` statement.

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values; it only affects the flow of the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the statement was executed.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list; `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is the first element in the `volumes` list; `remaining_kvass` is `s`.**
