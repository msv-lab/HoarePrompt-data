The `volumes.sort()` function sorts the list `volumes` in ascending order. This means that the elements in the list `volumes` will be rearranged so that they are sorted from the smallest to the largest value. The other variables, `n` and `s`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \le n \le 10^3\), `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order.**
