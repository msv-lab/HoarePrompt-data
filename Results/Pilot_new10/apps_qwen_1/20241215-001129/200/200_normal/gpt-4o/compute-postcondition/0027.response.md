The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without executing any of the subsequent statements in the loop body. The variables `n`, `s`, `volumes`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `i` is \(i + 1\) and must be less than `n` remains valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is the first element in the `volumes` list; `i` is \(i + 1\) and must be less than `n`.**
