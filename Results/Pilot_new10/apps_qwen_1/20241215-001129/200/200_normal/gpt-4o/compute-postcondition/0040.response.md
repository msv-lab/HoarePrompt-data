Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `s`, and a list of integers `volumes` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`, `1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12`, and `1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9` for all `i` in the range `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. The function first sorts the `volumes` list and calculates the total volume. If the total volume is less than `s`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it iterates through the sorted `volumes` list to find the minimum keg volume that can satisfy the required `s` amount of kvass, considering the remaining kvass needed. If there is still some kvass required after the iteration, it adjusts the `min_keg_volume` by reducing it proportionally. Finally, it prints the adjusted `min_keg_volume`.**
