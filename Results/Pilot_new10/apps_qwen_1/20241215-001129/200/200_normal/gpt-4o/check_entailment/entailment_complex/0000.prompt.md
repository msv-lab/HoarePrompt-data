You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: $n$ is an integer such that $1 \le n \le 10^3$, $s$ is an integer such that $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$, and $v_i$ is an integer such that $1 \le v_i \le 10^9$ for all $i$ in the range $1 \le i \le n$.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is the first element in the `volumes` list; `i` is the index of the first volume in `volumes` that is greater than `min_keg_volume`, or `n` if no such volume exists; `remaining_kvass` is 0 if all the required kvass was taken or the remaining amount of kvass needed if not.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is decreased by \(\left(\frac{remaining\_kvass + n - 1}{n}\right)\); `i` is the index of the first volume in `volumes` that is greater than `min_keg_volume`, or `n` if no such volume exists; `remaining_kvass` is either 0 (if all required kvass has been taken) or reduced according to the specified formula if kvass still needs to be taken.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \le n \le 10^3\), `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `min_keg_volume` is decreased by \(\left(\frac{remaining\_kvass + n - 1}{n}\right)\), `i` is the index of the first volume in `volumes` that is greater than `min_keg_volume`, or `n` if no such volume exists, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 or reduced accordingly, and `min_keg_volume` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `s`, and a list of integers `volumes` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`, `1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12`, and `1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9` for all `i` in the range `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. The function first sorts the `volumes` list and calculates the total volume. If the total volume is less than `s`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it iterates through the sorted `volumes` list to find the minimum keg volume that can satisfy the required `s` amount of kvass, considering the remaining kvass needed. If there is still some kvass required after the iteration, it adjusts the `min_keg_volume` by reducing it proportionally. Finally, it prints the adjusted `min_keg_volume`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
