You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total volume of kvass is less than `s` but does not provide the correct minimum volume in the least keg. According to the problem description, if the total volume of kvass is less than `s`, the output should be `-1`. However, the program checks this condition but does not handle it correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 7
1 2 3
```
In this case, the total volume of kvass is `6`, which is less than `7`. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`. However, the program will attempt to distribute the `7` liters of kvass among the kegs and will output a value instead of `-1`.

To fix this, the program needs to check the total volume before attempting to distribute the kvass and print `-1` if the total volume is less than `s`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)
```

This ensures that the program handles the case where the total volume is insufficient correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))

    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)

        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :

        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \le n \le 10^3\), `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `min_keg_volume` is decreased by \(\left(\frac{remaining\_kvass + n - 1}{n}\right)\), `i` is the index of the first volume in `volumes` that is greater than `min_keg_volume`, or `n` if no such volume exists, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 or reduced accordingly, and `min_keg_volume` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `s`, and a list of integers `volumes` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`, `1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12`, and `1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9` for all `i` in the range `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. The function first sorts the `volumes` list and calculates the total volume. If the total volume is less than `s`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it iterates through the sorted `volumes` list to find the minimum keg volume that can satisfy the required `s` amount of kvass, considering the remaining kvass needed. If there is still some kvass required after the iteration, it adjusts the `min_keg_volume` by reducing it proportionally. Finally, it prints the adjusted `min_keg_volume`.
