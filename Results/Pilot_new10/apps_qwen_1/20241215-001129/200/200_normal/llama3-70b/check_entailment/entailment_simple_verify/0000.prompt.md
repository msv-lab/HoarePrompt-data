You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the binary search approach to find the maximum possible amount of kvass that can be in the least keg while ensuring the total amount taken is at least `s` liters. Here's a brief breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `low` and `high` to set up the binary search bounds, where `low` starts at 0 (impossible state) and `high` is the smallest volume in any keg.

2. **Binary Search Loop**: It performs a binary search to find the maximum possible amount (`mid`) that can be poured into each keg without violating the condition that the total amount is at least `s`. 

3. **Total Calculation**: For each `mid`, it calculates the total amount of kvass that can be poured by taking the minimum of `mid` and the current keg's volume for each keg.

4. **Adjusting Bounds**: Depending on whether the total is less than `s`, it adjusts the `low` or `high` bound to narrow down the search space.

5. **Validation**: After the loop, it checks if the calculated total is exactly `s`. If not, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the `low` value, which represents the maximum possible amount of kvass in the least keg.

This approach handles various edge cases, such as when the total volume in all kegs is less than `s` or when the initial volumes are already below `s`. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program appears to cover all necessary scenarios accurately.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and s, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of kegs and the volume of the glass, respectively. Additionally, there is a list of n integers v, where each v_i (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9) represents the volume of the i-th keg.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `total` is `v[0] + v[1]` if both elements in `v` are less than or equal to `mid`, otherwise it is `v[0] + min(v[1], mid)`; `n` is the first integer entered by the user; `s` is the second integer entered by the user; `v` is a list of two integers sorted in ascending order; `low` is 0; `high` is 0; `mid` is 0. The final value of `total` is the minimum total such that `total >= s` and no further iterations of the loop would change this value.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`total` is the minimum total such that `total >= s` and no further iterations of the loop would change this value. If the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element in `v` is not equal to `s`, the printed value is `-1`. Otherwise, the sum of the minimum values of each element in `v` with `low` equals `s`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parameters:**
   - The function takes two inputs: `n` and `s` (both integers).
   - Constraints: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\) and \(1 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\).
   - There is also a list of `n` integers `v`, where each `v_i` (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9).

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `v` is sorted in ascending order using `v.sort()`.

3. **Binary Search for Minimum Total Volume:**
   - The function uses a binary search approach to find the smallest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` is at least `s`.
   - The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and `min(v)` respectively.
   - The binary search continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`.

4. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - Inside the loop, `mid` is calculated as \(\text{low} + \frac{\text{high} - \text{low} + 1}{2}\).
   - The total volume `total` is computed as the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each element `x` in `v`.
   - If `total` is less than `s`, `low` is updated to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

5. **Post-Loop Conditions:**
   - After the loop, the function checks if the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` equals `s`.
   - If the sum is not equal to `s`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `low`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Edge Case:** If `v` contains only one element, the binary search might not work as expected. However, since `v` is sorted, this edge case is handled by the binary search logic.
- **Edge Case:** If `low` reaches the maximum possible value and the condition is still not met, the loop will exit with `low` being the best possible solution.

### Summary of Functionality:

The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `s`, along with a list of `n` integers `v`. It sorts the list `v` and performs a binary search to find the smallest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` is at least `s`. If such a `low` is found and the sum equals `s`, it prints `low`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
