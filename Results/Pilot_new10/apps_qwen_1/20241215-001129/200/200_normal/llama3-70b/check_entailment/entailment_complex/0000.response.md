Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `s` from the first line and the list of volumes `v` from the second line. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Sorting the Volumes:**
   - The list `v` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting is necessary to apply the binary search effectively, ensuring that we can efficiently find the minimum volume in the least keg.

3. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The program uses a binary search approach to find the smallest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` is at least `s`.
   - The binary search ensures that we minimize the volume in the least keg while meeting the requirement of having at least `s` liters in total.

4. **Checking the Condition:**
   - After the binary search, the program checks if the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` equals `s`. If it does, it prints `low`. If not, it prints `-1`.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where it is not possible to get exactly `s` liters by considering the constraints and sorting the volumes.
   - If the initial `high` value (which is the minimum volume in the list) is already greater than or equal to `s`, the program correctly identifies that it can satisfy the requirement without further adjustments.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum volume in the least keg while ensuring the total volume is at least `s` liters. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
