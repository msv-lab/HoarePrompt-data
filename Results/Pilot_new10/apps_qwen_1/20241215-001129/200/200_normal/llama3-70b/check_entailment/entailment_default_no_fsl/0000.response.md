Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided code attempts to solve the problem using a binary search approach, but there are several issues that make the solution incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Condition:**
   - The condition `if total < s:` should update `high` to `mid - 1` instead of `mid`. This is because we want the minimum value to be as large as possible, so we need to move the upper bound down if the current `mid` does not satisfy the condition.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The code does not handle the case where the total volume required `s` cannot be achieved by any valid `low`. For example, consider the input:
     ```
     3 10
     1 2 3
     ```
     The correct output should be `-1` because it is impossible to achieve a total of 10 liters from the given volumes. However, the current implementation will not correctly handle this scenario.

To fix these issues, the binary search condition should be adjusted, and additional checks should be added to handle the edge case where the total volume required cannot be achieved. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    
    if s > sum(v):
        print(-1)
        return
    
    low, high = 0, v[-1]
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        if total >= s:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid
    
    if sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the binary search correctly updates the bounds and handles the edge case where the total volume required cannot be achieved.
