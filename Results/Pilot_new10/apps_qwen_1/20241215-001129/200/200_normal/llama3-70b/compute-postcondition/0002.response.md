`v.sort()` sorts the list `v` in ascending order. The original values of `n` and `s` are used to create the list `v`, which initially contains two elements, `n` and `s`. After sorting, the list `v` will contain these two elements in sorted order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `s` is the second integer entered by the user, and `v` is a list of two integers sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer entered by the user, `s` is the second integer entered by the user, and `v` is a list of two integers sorted in ascending order.**
