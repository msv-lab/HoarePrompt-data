The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and a string `s` consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', representing golden and silver trophies respectively. It calculates the maximum beauty of the trophies by either keeping them as they are or by swapping one silver trophy for a golden one. The maximum beauty is defined as the maximum number of consecutive golden trophies. The function returns the higher of the original maximum beauty and the maximum beauty after one possible swap.
