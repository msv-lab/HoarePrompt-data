`beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `beauty` is either 2 or 3, so after incrementing, `beauty` will be either 3 or 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is 1, `beauty` is either 3 or 4, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is 1, `beauty` is either 3 or 4, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary.**
