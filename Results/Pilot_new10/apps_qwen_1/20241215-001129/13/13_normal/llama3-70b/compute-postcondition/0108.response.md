According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop `for j in range(i + 2, n)` will start if the condition `i + 2 <= n` is satisfied. Given that `i` is currently 2 and `n` must be at least 2, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 4 (since `i + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`).

Additionally, the initial state of `j` being -1 means it does not satisfy the starting condition of the loop (since `j` should start from `i + 2`, which is 4). Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to start from 4.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check the condition `i + 2 <= n`:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be at least 4 (`2 + 2`).
   
2. **Initial value of `j`:**
   - `j` is initially -1, but it should start from `i + 2`, which is 4.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `n` must be at least 4.
- `j` must be 4 (or start from 4).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 4, `beauty` is at most 3, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration.**
