Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `j` is -1
   - `beauty` is either 2 or 3
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs over `j` starting from `i - 1` (which is 1) and going down to `-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is -1, meaning the loop has finished its execution for all valid values of `j`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must start from `i - 1` again.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the new value for `j` should start from `1` and go down to `-1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `j` starts from `1` for the next iteration.
   - `beauty` remains either 2 or 3 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` remains the same as it was updated if necessary during the previous iterations and is not affected by the loop itself.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `j` is 1
   - `beauty` is either 2 or 3
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is 1, `beauty` is either 2 or 3, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary**
