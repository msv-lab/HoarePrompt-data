`left` is incremented by 1. The value of `left` was previously less than `right` and was an index where `s[left]` is 'S'. After incrementing, `left` is now one more than its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is increased by 1 and is still less than `right`, `right` is a value such that `right < n` and `s[right]` is not 'G', `right` has incremented by 1 on each iteration since the start of the loop.
