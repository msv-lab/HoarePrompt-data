Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty` if `s[right]` is not 'G'. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is set to 1, `left` is set to 0, and `right` is set to 1.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
