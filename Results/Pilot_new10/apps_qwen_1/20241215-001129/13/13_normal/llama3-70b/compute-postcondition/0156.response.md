Output State: **`s` is a string, `beauty` is the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[j:j+1]` where `j` is the largest index such that `s[j] == 'G'` and `j >= i + 2`, or `beauty` is 0 if no such `j` exists. `j` is the index where the loop last checked, which is `n - 1` if the loop did not break early, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
