According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `j` is 4, `beauty` is at most 3, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration. 

Since `j` is currently 4, and the loop starts from `i + 2` (which is 4), the loop cannot execute again because `j` is already equal to `n - 2`.

However, let's consider the possible states if the loop were to execute again:

1. `j` would be incremented by 1, making it 5.
2. For the loop to continue, `n` must remain at least 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `j` is 5, `beauty` is at most 3, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration.**

This ensures that the loop can potentially execute again if `j` becomes 5, which is less than `n` (which is at least 4).
