To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed, let's analyze the loop logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.
   - `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
   - `max_beauty` is initialized to 0.
   - `curr_beauty` is initialized to 0.
   - `left` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using the index `right`.
   - If `s[right]` is 'G', `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s[right]` is not 'G', `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. `curr_beauty` is reset to 0, and `left` is adjusted to the next index of 'G' in `s` (or `left` is set to `right` if no more 'G' is found).

3. **Final State Analysis**:
   - After the loop completes, `max_beauty` will hold the maximum beauty encountered during the traversal of the string `s`.
   - `curr_beauty` will be the beauty at the last position `right` where `s[right]` is 'G' or 0 if there are no more 'G' characters to the right of `left`.
   - `left` will be the index of the last 'G' character in `s` if any are present, otherwise, it will be `n`.

4. **State Summary**:
   - The final value of `max_beauty` is the highest beauty found in any segment of consecutive 'G' characters.
   - `curr_beauty` reflects the beauty at the end of the string or the last 'G' character.
   - `left` indicates the index of the last 'G' character in the string, or `n` if no 'G' characters are present.

Given this analysis, the output state after the loop executes is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum beauty found during the traversal of `s`, `curr_beauty` is the beauty at the last position `right` where `s[right]` is 'G' or 0, `left` is the index of the last 'G' character in `s` or `n` if no 'G' characters are present.**
