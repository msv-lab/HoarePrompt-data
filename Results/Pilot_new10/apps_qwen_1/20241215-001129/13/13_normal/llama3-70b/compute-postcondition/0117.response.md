Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `j` is 5. If `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is at most 4 and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration. Otherwise, `beauty` is at most 3 and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
