The code `left += 1` increments the value of `left` by 1. Since the initial state is that `left` is `left + 1` and `s[left]` is not 'G', after incrementing `left` by 1, the condition `s[left]` is not 'G' will be checked again. However, since the code does not change the value of `s[left]`, the condition remains the same.

Output State: **`left` is `left + 2` and `s[left]` is not 'G'**
