The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but takes input through other means (implied from the problem statement). The function reads an integer `n` such that `2 <= n <= 10^5` and a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'. After processing this input, the function returns a value based on the count of 'G' and 'S' in the string.
