The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `beauty`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `s`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 and the specific values of `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string where the current value of `s[i]` is 'G' and the current value of `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is 1**
