The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and the second line of input is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'. After executing the code, the variable `s` will hold the string input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'**
