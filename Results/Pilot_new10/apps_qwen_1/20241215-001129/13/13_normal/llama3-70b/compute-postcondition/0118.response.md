According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the condition `i + 2 <= n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 5.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1 (since `j` starts from `i + 2`, which is 4) and must still be within the bounds defined by `i + 2 <= n`.

Given that `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 4, the next value of `j` should be 6 to satisfy the condition `i + 2 <= n` (2 + 2 = 4, and 6 > 4).

The other variables (`beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`) will depend on the loop body, but since no specific operations on these variables are mentioned, they remain as they are unless explicitly changed within the loop body.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 6, and `n` remains at least 4.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `j` is 6**
