Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided information and the structure of the loop code.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `j` is `n` (so initially `j` is 3)
- `beauty` is 1
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and 1 (which is 1 since the initial value is 1)

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```

### Analysis:

1. **First Iteration (j = 2):**
   - If `s[2] == 'G'`, `beauty` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s[2] != 'G'`, the loop breaks.

2. **Second Iteration (j = 1):**
   - If `s[1] == 'G'`, `beauty` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s[1] != 'G'`, the loop breaks.

3. **Third Iteration (j = 0):**
   - If `s[0] == 'G'`, `beauty` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s[0] != 'G'`, the loop breaks.

### Output States for the First Few Iterations:

- **After the loop executes 1 time:** `s` is a string, `j` is 2, and `beauty` is increased by 1 if `s[2]` is 'G'.
- **After the loop executes 2 times:** `s` is a string, `j` is 1, and `beauty` is increased by 1 if `s[2]` is 'G' and by 1 if `s[1]` is 'G'.
- **After the loop executes 3 times:** `s` is a string, `j` is 0, and `beauty` is increased by 1 if `s[2]` is 'G' and by 1 if `s[1]` is 'G' and by 1 if `s[0]` is 'G'.

### Final Output State After All Iterations:

- The loop will iterate from `j = i - 1` down to 0.
- `beauty` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'G' in the substring `s[i-1:i]`.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing, `beauty` will be the count of 'G' characters in the substring `s[i-1:i]` of the string `s`.

### Output State:
**Output State: `s` is a string, `beauty` is the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[i-1:i]`, and `j` is the index where the loop last checked, which is 0 if the loop did not break early.**

This final state captures the values of the variables after all iterations of the loop, considering both cases where the loop completes all iterations and where it breaks early due to encountering a non-'G' character.
