The provided code snippet does not modify any variables; it only prints the value of `max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap)`. Since the variables `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` already existed in the initial state, their values remain unchanged. The output of the print statement will be the maximum of these two values.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that the value of `max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap)` is printed.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is the largest index such that `s[j] == 'G'` and `j >= i + 2`, or `n` if no such index exists, `beauty` is the maximum value of `beauty` calculated for all valid pairs, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value of `beauty` across all iterations, and the value of `max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap)` is printed.**
