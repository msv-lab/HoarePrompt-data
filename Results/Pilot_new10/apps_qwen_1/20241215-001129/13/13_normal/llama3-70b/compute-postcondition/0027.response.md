Let's break down the conditions under which the `while` loop will execute at least once:

1. The loop condition is `left < right and s[left] != 'G'`.
2. For the loop to execute, both conditions inside the `and` operator must be true.

Given the initial state before the loop:
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
- `left` is the same as the previous iteration.
- `right` is `n - 1`.
- `curr_beauty` is 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `left < right`:**
   - `right` is `n - 1`.
   - This condition will always be true as long as `left` is less than `n - 1`.

2. **Condition `s[left] != 'G'`:**
   - For this condition to be true, `s[left]` must not be 'G'.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to guarantee that `s[left]` is not 'G'. If `s[left]` were 'G', the loop would not start.

### Adjusting the State:

Since `s[left]` must not be 'G' for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `s[left]` is not 'G' before the loop starts. 

Thus, the state adjustment needed is that `s[left]` should not be 'G'.

### Final State:

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is the same as the previous iteration, `right` is `n - 1`, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'**.
