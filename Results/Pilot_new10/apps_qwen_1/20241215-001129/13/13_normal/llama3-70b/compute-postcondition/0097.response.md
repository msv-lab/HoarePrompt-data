The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but indicates the exit from the nearest loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement specified in the initial state that would be affected by this `break`, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is determined based on the condition `s[1] == 'G' and s[2] == 'S'`, `beauty` is 1, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary, `s[j]` is not equal to 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
