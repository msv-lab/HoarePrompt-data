Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a string.
   - `beauty` is the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[j:j+1]`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i + 2, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i + 2` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.

4. **Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` starts at 0, the first value it can take in the next iteration is `i + 2`.
   - Given that `j` must be in the range `i + 2` to `n-1`, the smallest possible value for `j` in the next iteration is `i + 2`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `beauty` will be updated based on the character `s[j]` if `j` is within the valid range (`i + 2` to `n-1`).
   - `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `beauty` will be the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[i+2:i+3]` (since `j` starts at `i + 2`).
   - `j` is set to `i + 2`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is a string, `beauty` is the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[i+2:i+3]`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
