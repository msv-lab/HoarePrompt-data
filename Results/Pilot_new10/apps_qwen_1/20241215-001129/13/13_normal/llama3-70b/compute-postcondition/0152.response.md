Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `s` is a string.
   - `beauty` is the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[i+2:i+3]`.
   - `j` is `i + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 2` up to but not including `n`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

4. **Calculate the New Values:**
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` was equal to `i + 2`.
   - To continue the loop, `j` needs to be incremented to `i + 3`.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, `j` becomes `i + 3`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`n > i + 1`) still holds as it only checks if `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `i + 3` is still less than `n` if `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

6. **Update the Variables:**
   - `beauty` remains unchanged unless `s[j]` is 'G', but we are not given that `s[j]` is 'G' or not, so `beauty` stays the same.
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a string, `beauty` is the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[i+2:i+3]`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
