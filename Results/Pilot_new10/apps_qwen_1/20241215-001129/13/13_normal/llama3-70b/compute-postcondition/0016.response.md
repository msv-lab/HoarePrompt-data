Let's analyze the given loop and the provided state step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
- `curr_beauty` is 0.
- `left` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `right`.
- `right` is a value such that `right < n` and `s[right]` is not 'G'.
- `right` has incremented by 1.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
For the loop to continue executing, both conditions inside the `while` loop must be true:
1. `left < right`
2. `s[left] != 'G'`

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `right`.
- `right` has incremented by 1.

This means:
- `left` is now `left + 1` and is still less than `right` (so `left < right` still holds true).
- `right` is now `right + 1`.

### Checking Conditions
1. **Condition 1: `left < right`**
   - Since `left` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `right`, this condition is already satisfied.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left] != 'G'`**
   - The only change in the string `s` from the previous iteration to the current iteration is that `s[right]` was not 'G'. After incrementing `left` and `right`, `s[left]` is the character that was previously `s[right]`.

Since `right` has incremented by 1 and `s[right]` was not 'G', `s[left]` (which is now `s[right-1]`) could be either 'G' or 'S'. However, we need to ensure that `s[left] != 'G'` for the loop to continue.

To satisfy the condition `s[left] != 'G'`, we need to ensure that `s[left]` is not 'G'. Therefore, `s[left]` must be 'S'.

### Adjusted States
The only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `s[left]` is 'S'. Since `s[left]` is the character that was previously `s[right]` and `s[right]` was not 'G', `s[left]` can be either 'G' or 'S'. We need to ensure that it is not 'G'.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State: `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `right`, `right` is a value such that `right < n` and `s[right]` is not 'G', `s[left]` must be 'S'.**
