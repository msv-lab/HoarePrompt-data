`beauty` is incremented by 1. Initially, `beauty` is 1, so after the increment, `beauty` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`i`, `s`, and the condition `s[j] == 'G'`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a string where the current value of `s[0]` is 'G' and the current value of `s[1]` is 'S', `beauty` is 2, and the condition `s[j] == 'G'` is true**
