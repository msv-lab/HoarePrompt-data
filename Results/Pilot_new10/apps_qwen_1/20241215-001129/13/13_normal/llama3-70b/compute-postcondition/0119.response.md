The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Since `beauty` was not defined in the initial state, we assume it is initialized to 0 before this line of code is executed. After executing the code, `beauty` will be 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `j` is 6, `beauty` is 1**
