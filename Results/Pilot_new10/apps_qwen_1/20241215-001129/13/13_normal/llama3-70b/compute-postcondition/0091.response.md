Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `j` is defined based on the condition `s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S'`. If this condition holds, `j` is the first index `k` such that `s[k] != 'G'` or `n` if no such index exists. Otherwise, `j` is `n`.
   - `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from `s[0]` to `s[n-1]` if the condition does not hold, otherwise the count of 'G's from `s[0]` to the last 'G' before `s[j]`.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between `max_beauty_one_swap` and `beauty`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n - 1)`, meaning it will run from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 (since the loop starts from 0 and the previous iteration would have ended at `i = 0`).

4. **Update the Variables for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`, the next iteration will be when `i` is 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be at least 2.
   - `j` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`, which is 1.
   - `beauty` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` will be updated if `beauty` changes.

5. **Recalculate `j` and `beauty` for the New Value of `i`:**
   - `j` will be determined based on the condition `s[1] == 'G' and s[2] == 'S'`.
   - If the condition holds, `j` will be the first index `k` such that `s[k] != 'G'` or `n` if no such index exists. Otherwise, `j` will be `n`.
   - `beauty` will be the number of consecutive 'G's from `s[0]` to `s[n-1]` if the condition does not hold, otherwise the count of 'G's from `s[0]` to the last 'G' before `s[j]`.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains at least 2.
   - `j` is recalculated based on the new `i` value.
   - `beauty` is recalculated based on the new `i` value.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` will be updated if necessary.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is determined based on the condition `s[1] == 'G' and s[2] == 'S'`, `beauty` is recalculated based on the new value of `i`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary.**
