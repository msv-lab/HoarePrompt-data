`curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The value of `curr_beauty` was initially 1, so now it is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is the index where `s[left] == 'G'` (or `left == right` if no more 'G' is found), `right` is `n - 2`, and `curr_beauty` is 2.
