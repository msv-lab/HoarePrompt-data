Postcondition: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0 initially and must increment by 1 on each iteration, the loop continues as long as `right < n`. The current value of `s[right]` is 'G'**
