The code creates a list `golden` containing the indices of all characters in the string `s` that are equal to 'G'. 

Let's denote the initial state of the variables:
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.

After running the code:
- The list `golden` is created with elements being the indices of 'G' in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'; `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.**
