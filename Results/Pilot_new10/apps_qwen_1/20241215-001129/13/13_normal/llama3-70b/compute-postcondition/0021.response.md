Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 1, `left` is incremented to `n`, `right` is `n`. Since the condition `left < right` is true, `curr_beauty` is set to 1 and `left` is set to `n`. There is no other change in the variables when `left >= right`.***
