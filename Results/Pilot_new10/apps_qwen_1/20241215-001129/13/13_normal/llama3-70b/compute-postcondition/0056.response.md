To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and initial conditions step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.
   - `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
   - `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
   - `curr_beauty` is the beauty at the last position `right` where `s[right]` is 'G' or 0.
   - `left` is the index of the last 'G' character in `s` or `n` if no 'G' characters are present.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution Requirements**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`, meaning the loop body will run `n - 1` times (since the range function in Python goes up to `n-1`).
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be incremented from 0 to `n-2`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `i` must start from 0.
   - The loop must ensure that there is at least one valid iteration, which means `n` must be at least 2 (as per the problem constraints).

Based on these points, the necessary adjustments are:

- `i` should be set to 0.
- `n` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the modified state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`total` is irrelevant as it was not mentioned in the context, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**.
