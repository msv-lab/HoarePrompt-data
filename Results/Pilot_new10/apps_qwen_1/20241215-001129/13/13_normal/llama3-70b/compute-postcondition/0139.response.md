The code `break` does not change any variable values; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given code snippet, the break statement does not have any effect on the variables `s`, `j`, and `beauty`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string `s` that is one less than its previous value, and `beauty` is increased by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G'. Otherwise, `beauty` remains unchanged.**
