The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value obtained from the input to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). After executing the code, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer input provided by the user, while the string consisting of 'G' and 'S' remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and the second line of input is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.**
