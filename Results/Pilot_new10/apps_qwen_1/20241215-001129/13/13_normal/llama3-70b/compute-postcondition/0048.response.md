Let's analyze the loop step by step and derive the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 1.
- `left` is the index where `s[left] == 'G'` (or `left == right` if no more 'G' is found).
- `right` is `n - 2`.
- `curr_beauty` is 0.

### Loop Analysis
The loop continues as long as `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`. In each iteration, `left` is incremented by 1 until `s[left] == 'G'` or `left` reaches `right`.

### After the Loop Executes Some Number of Times
- After the loop executes 1 time: `left` is `left + 1` and the conditions for the next iteration are checked.
- After the loop executes 2 times: `left` is `left + 2` and `s[left]` is not 'G'.
- After the loop executes 3 times: `left` is incremented by 1, `left + 4 < right` is still true, and `s[left + 2]` is not 'G'.

### General Pattern
From the given examples, we can infer that:
- Each iteration of the loop increments `left` by 1 until `s[left] == 'G'`.
- The loop will continue as long as `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`.
- Once `s[left] == 'G'`, the loop exits.

### Final State
After the loop has executed, the following must be true:
- `left` will be the index where `s[left] == 'G'` (or `left == right` if no more 'G' is found).
- The loop will have exited when either `left == right` or `s[left] == 'G'`.

Thus, the output state after the loop has finished executing is:

**Output State: `left` is the index where `s[left] == 'G'` (or `left == right` if no more 'G' is found), `right` is `n - 2`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `curr_beauty` retain their original values.**
