The given code initializes the variable `max_beauty` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, or `golden`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'; `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is 0.**
