Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a string.
   - `j` is an index within the string `s`.
   - If `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is increased by 1.
   - If `s[j]` is not 'G', the value of `beauty` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Description:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `i - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `j` by 1 each time (`range(i - 1, -1, -1)`).

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be a valid index within the string `s` and `j` must be greater than or equal to 0. The loop will stop when `j` becomes -1.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is an index within the string `s` and it is being decremented by 1 each time through the loop.
   - To continue the loop, `j` needs to be adjusted to be one step closer to 0 (the start of the string) but still a valid index.

5. **New State:**
   - `j` should be decreased by 1 from its previous value.
   - The value of `beauty` remains unchanged unless `s[j]` is 'G' during this iteration, but since we are only adjusting the state before entering the loop, we assume no new condition has been met to change `beauty`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string `s` that is one less than its previous value, and `beauty` remains unchanged**.
