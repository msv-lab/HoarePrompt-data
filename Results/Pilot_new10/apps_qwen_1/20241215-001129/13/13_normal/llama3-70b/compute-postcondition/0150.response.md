The code `break` does not affect any variables and simply exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block was specified, we assume this is outside of any such blocks, meaning the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `beauty` is the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[i+2:i+3]`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
