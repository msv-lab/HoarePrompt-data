You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are isolated golden trophies (i.e., a single 'G' that is not part of a segment of golden trophies). When such a case occurs, the program might not be able to correctly maximize the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies through a single swap.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
GGGSGSGB
```

Expected output: `6` (by swapping the 'S' at index 4 with the 'B' at index 7, resulting in "GGGSGGBG").

However, the current implementation will output `4`, because it only checks for consecutive segments and does not account for the possibility of isolating a single 'G' within a segment.

To fix this, the program needs to check for isolated 'G's and attempt to connect them with existing segments through a single swap.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, starting from the first 'G' found and ending just before the next 'S' or the end of the string, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, starting from the first 'G' found and ending just before the next 'S' or the end of the string, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. The list `segments` is not empty
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns the maximum length of the segment containing consecutive 'G's in the list 'segments', which is the length of the single segment present
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, starting from the first 'G' found and ending just before the next 'S' or the end of the string, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `max_length` is the maximum length of the segments in `segments`; `len(segments)` is greater than 1
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `len(segments)`, `prev_start` is the start value of the last segment in `segments`, `prev_end` is the end value of the last segment in `segments`, `curr_start` is undefined, `curr_end` is undefined, and `max_length` is the maximum value of `max_length` updated during the loop iterations based on the condition `curr_start - prev_end == 2`.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #`The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and a string `trophies` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' (golden) and 'S' (silver). The function processes the string to find segments of consecutive 'G's and calculates the maximum length of these segments. If no segments are found, it returns 0. If there is only one segment, it returns its length. If there are multiple segments, it checks for specific conditions where the segments can be combined to form longer segments and updates the maximum length accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and the length of the string `trophies`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
