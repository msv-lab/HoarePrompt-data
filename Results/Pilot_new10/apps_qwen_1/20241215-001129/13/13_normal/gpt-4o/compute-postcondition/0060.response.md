Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `prev_start` is the start value of the second segment, `prev_end` is the end value of the second segment, `curr_start` is the start value of the third segment, `curr_end` is the end value of the third segment, and `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - prev_start + 1` if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, otherwise `max_length` remains unchanged.***
