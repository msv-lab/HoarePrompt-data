The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' (golden) and 'S' (silver).

- In Case_1, the function returns 0.
- In Case_2, the function returns the maximum length of the segment containing consecutive 'G's in the string `trophies`.
- In Case_3, the function returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies` of length `n` containing 'G' and 'S'. Depending on certain conditions, it returns either 0, the maximum length of consecutive 'G's, or the minimum value between the maximum length of consecutive 'G's plus one and the length of the string `trophies`.
