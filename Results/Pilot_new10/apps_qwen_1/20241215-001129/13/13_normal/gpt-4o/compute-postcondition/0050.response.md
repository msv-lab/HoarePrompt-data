Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`.
- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `max_length` is the maximum length of the segments in `segments`.
- `len(segments)` is greater than 1.

### Analysis of the Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `for i in range(1, len(segments)):`. This means that the loop will start iterating over the `segments` list from index 1 until the end (not including the last element).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is set to `n`. For the loop to start executing, `i` should start from 1 (inclusive) and go up to `len(segments) - 1` (exclusive). Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to start from 1.
   
2. **Range of `segments`:**
   - Since `len(segments)` is greater than 1, there must be at least 2 segments in the list. This ensures that the loop has something to iterate over.

3. **Value of `n`:**
   - The value of `n` is given as an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). However, since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the specific value of `n` does not affect the loop's execution directly, but it must be within the specified range to ensure the initial conditions are met.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `segments`, `trophies`, `max_length`, and `len(segments)` are already correctly defined and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, the only necessary adjustments are to set `i` to start from 1 instead of `n`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `len(segments)` is greater than 1**

This state ensures that the loop can start executing from the second segment in the `segments` list.
