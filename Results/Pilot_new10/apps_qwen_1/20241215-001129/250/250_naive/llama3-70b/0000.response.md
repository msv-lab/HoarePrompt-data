Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the necessary additional marks can be derived from the existing marks and the target distances \(x\) and \(y\).

Consider the following input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 20 250
```
According to the problem description, we need to determine if the ruler can measure both \(x = 185\) and \(y = 230\). In this case, the ruler already has a mark at 20 cm, but there is no mark at 185 cm or 230 cm. However, we can derive these distances using the existing marks:

- The distance between the 0 cm mark and the 20 cm mark is 20 cm.
- To get 185 cm, we can add a mark at 185 cm.
- To get 230 cm, we can add a mark at 230 cm.

The program, however, checks for exact differences between existing marks and does not consider the possibility of deriving the required distances from the existing ones. It also does not account for the fact that the additional marks can be placed anywhere within the range of the ruler.

Thus, the program fails to correctly determine the minimum number of additional marks needed in this case, making it incorrect.
