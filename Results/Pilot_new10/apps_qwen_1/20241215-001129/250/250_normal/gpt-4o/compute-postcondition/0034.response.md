To determine the necessary states before the loop to ensure it executes, let's analyze the conditions under which the loop would run based on the provided information.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop runs over each element in the `marks` list. There are no explicit conditions given in the for loop itself (e.g., `if` statements or break/continue) that would prevent it from executing as long as there are elements in `marks`.

2. **Initial States Provided**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\).
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\).
   - `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list.
   - `x_found` is `True` if any `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`.
   - `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`.
   - `new_marks` is an empty set.
   - Either `x_found` or `y_found` is not `True` after iterating through all elements in `marks`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `marks` contains at least one element.
   - Given that `x_found` or `y_found` is not `True` after the loop, this means there must be some `mark` in `marks` such that neither `mark + x` nor `mark - x` (nor `mark + y` or `mark - y`) is found in `marks_set`.

Since the loop simply iterates over all elements in `marks` without additional stopping conditions, the only necessary adjustment is ensuring `marks` is non-empty. The conditions involving `x_found` and `y_found` do not affect the loop's execution directly; they are evaluated after the loop.

**State Adjustment**:
- `marks` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the final state required for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True` if any `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, and either `x_found` or `y_found` is not `True` after iterating through all elements in `marks`.**
