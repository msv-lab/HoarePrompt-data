The code snippet adds `mark + x` to `new_marks`. The value of `mark` is taken from the current iteration of the loop in the `marks` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `marks_set` remains a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list.
- `x_found` remains as `False` because the condition to set it to `True` was not met (only `mark + x` was added, not `mark + y`).
- `y_found` remains as `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` was in `marks_set`.
- `new_marks` now contains `mark + x` for the current `mark` from the `marks` list.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list; `x_found` is `False`; `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`; `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + x` for each `mark` in `marks` such that at least one of the conditions `(mark + x + y in marks_set or mark + x - y in marks_set or mark - y + x in marks_set)` holds true.**
