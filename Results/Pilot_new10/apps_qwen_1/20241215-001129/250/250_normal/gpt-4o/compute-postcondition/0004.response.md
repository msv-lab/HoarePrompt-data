The code `y_found = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `y_found`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks_set`, or `x_found`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False**
