Postcondition: ***`marks` must contain at least one element, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set containing either `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` for each `mark` in `marks`, depending on whether any of these values are in `marks_set`. Neither `x_found` nor `y_found` is `True`.***
