Postcondition: ***`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `False`. `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is an empty list.***

Explanation: Since the condition `if (not x_found):` is true, the only change in the postcondition is that `x_found` remains `False`. All other variables retain their states as described in the precondition.
