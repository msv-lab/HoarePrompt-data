The code sets `x_found` to `True`, which was already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True**
