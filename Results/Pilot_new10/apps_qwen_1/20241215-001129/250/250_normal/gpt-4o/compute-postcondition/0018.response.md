The variable `y_found` is assigned the value `True`. This does not change the value of `y_found` itself, but it confirms its current state. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, and the conditions related to `mark + x` or `mark - x` being in `marks_set` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`.**
