Postcondition: ***`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list; `x_found` remains `False`; `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`; `new_marks` is a set containing elements derived from the `marks` list according to the specified conditions. If the condition `mark - y + x in marks_set` or `mark - y - x in marks_set` is satisfied, `mark - y` is added to `new_marks`. Otherwise, `new_marks` does not change. The loop continues with the next `mark` from the `marks` list.***
