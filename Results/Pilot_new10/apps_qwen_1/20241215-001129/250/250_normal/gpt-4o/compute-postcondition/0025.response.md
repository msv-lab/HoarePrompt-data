The line `y_found = True` sets the variable `y_found` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the new value of `y_found`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `mark` is the next element in the `marks` list, `x_found` is `True` if `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`. Otherwise, `x_found` remains unchanged; `y_found` is `True`.**
