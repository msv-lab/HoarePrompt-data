Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True` if any `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, and either `x_found` or `y_found` is not `True` after iterating through all elements in `marks`, and `marks_set` remains unchanged**
