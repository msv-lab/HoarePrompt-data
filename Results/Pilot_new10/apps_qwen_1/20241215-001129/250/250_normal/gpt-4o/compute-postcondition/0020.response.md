The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most internal if statement. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or if statement mentioned, the `break` statement does not affect any variable values directly but indicates that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it was in.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with all conditions unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, the condition remains true. Otherwise, the condition remains false. And we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
