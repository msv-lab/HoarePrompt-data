The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input using `input().split()` and converts each of them into an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `marks`. The values of `n` and `l` remain unchanged, and the variables `x` and `y` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a list of n integers obtained from the input.**
