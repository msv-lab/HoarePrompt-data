`need_y` is reassigned to `True`. The value of `need_y` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected. The precondition that `need_x` is set to `True` if `marks[1] - marks[0]` equals `x`, otherwise `need_x` remains unchanged, is still valid.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `need_x` is set to `True` if `marks[1] - marks[0]` equals `x`, otherwise `need_x` remains unchanged, `need_y` is `True`**
