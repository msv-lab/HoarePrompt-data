The code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. Given that `i` is the first element of the `marks` list and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after `n-1`, the value of `i + j` is added to `additional_marks`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`, and `additional_marks` is now a list containing `x`, `y`, and `i + j`.**
