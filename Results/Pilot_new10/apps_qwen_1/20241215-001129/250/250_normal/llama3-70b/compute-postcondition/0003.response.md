Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
   - `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\)
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\)
   - `marks` is a set of integers created from the input values
   - `need_x` is `False`
   - `need_y` is `False`

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Key Variables for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop variable `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` each iteration.
   - The loop will continue until `i` reaches `n`.

5. **States to Adjust**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n` initially.
   - Since `i` starts at `0`, the loop will execute at least once if `i` is less than `n`.

Given these points, the critical states to adjust are:
- Ensure `i` is less than `n` at the start of the loop.

The other states (`l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `need_x`, `need_y`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `i` is 0 (or more generally, less than `n`)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)

Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)**
