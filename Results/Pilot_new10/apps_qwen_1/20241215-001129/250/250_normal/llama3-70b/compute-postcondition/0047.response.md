The variable `need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `need_x`, `marks[j] - marks[i]`, and `y`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is \(n + 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, the condition \(marks[j] - marks[i] \neq x\) holds, and the current value of \(marks[j] - marks[i]\) is equal to \(y\).**
