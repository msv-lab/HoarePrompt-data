Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Understanding**:
   - `i` is the first element of the `marks` list.
   - `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after `n-1`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.
   - `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`, `y`, and `i + j`, if `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `additional_marks` still being a list containing `x` and `y`.

2. **For Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.

3. **Loop Iteration Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be the next element in `additional_marks` after `n`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after `n-1`, for the next iteration, `j` should be the next element in `additional_marks` after `n`.
   - All other states (`i`, `n`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and `additional_marks`) remain unchanged.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is the first element of the `marks` list (unchanged).
   - `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after `n`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) (unchanged).
   - `need_x` is `False` (unchanged).
   - `need_y` is `False` (unchanged).
   - `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`, `y`, and `i + j`, if `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `additional_marks` still being a list containing `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`, `y`, and `i + j`, if `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `additional_marks` still being a list containing `x` and `y`.**
