According to the given code, the loop iterates over the range from `i` to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1
- `need_x` is `True`
- `need_y` is `True`
- The condition `marks[j] - marks[0] == x` holds, where `x` is the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[0]`
- If `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` is true, where `y` is the current difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]`, then the postcondition includes the state when this condition is met. If `marks[j] - marks[i] != y`, the postcondition does not change from the precondition.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `i + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

The new state at the start of the next iteration will be as follows:

- `i` remains 1
- `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1
- `need_x` remains `True`
- `need_y` remains `True`
- The condition `marks[j] - marks[0] == x` still holds for `j = 1`
- For `j = 2`, we need to check if `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. If it does, the postcondition will include the state when this condition is met.

Since `j` starts from 1 and increases by 1 for each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and `marks[2] - marks[0] == x` holds if the condition is checked.**
