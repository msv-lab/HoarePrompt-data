The code `print(len(additional_marks))` simply prints the length of the `additional_marks` list. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and the contents of `additional_marks` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state will still include the same values for these variables, and only the length of `additional_marks` will be printed.

Output State: **`i` is the last element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list that contains all unique elements `i + j` such that `i + j \leq l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`. The length of `additional_marks` is printed.**
