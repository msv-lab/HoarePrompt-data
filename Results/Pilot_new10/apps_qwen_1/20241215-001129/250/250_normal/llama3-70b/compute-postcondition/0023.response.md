Let's break down the requirements for the for loop to execute based on the given conditions:

1. **Loop Initialization and Conditions**:
   - The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i`.
   - The loop runs as long as `j < n`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is already 1.
   - `n` must be an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `need_x` is True if there exists at least one `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0] == x`.
   - `need_y` is True if there exists at least one `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0] == y`.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is 1, the critical condition here is whether `n` is greater than 1.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Given that `i` is 1, the loop will start executing if `n > 1`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 (since `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to start).

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The values of `need_x` and `need_y` do not affect the ability of the loop to start executing; they only provide information about the existence of certain conditions within the loop.

Based on this analysis, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Thus, the final state needed to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1, `need_x` is True if `marks[j] - marks[0] == x` for at least one `j`, and `need_y` is True if `marks[j] - marks[0] == y` for at least one `j`**.
