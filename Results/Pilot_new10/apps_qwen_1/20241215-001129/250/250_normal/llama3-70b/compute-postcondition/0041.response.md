According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is equal to the value of `n`
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `need_x` is `True`
- `need_y` is `True`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. Therefore, `i` must now be less than `n`. However, since `i` was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` needs to be incremented to satisfy the condition `i < n`.

So, the new state is:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` remains the same, still an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `need_x` remains `True`
- `need_y` remains `True`

State: **`i` is \(n + 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is `True`**
