Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` remains unchanged. The condition `marks[j] - marks[0] == x` holds for the current value of `j`, and `x` is the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[0]`.**
