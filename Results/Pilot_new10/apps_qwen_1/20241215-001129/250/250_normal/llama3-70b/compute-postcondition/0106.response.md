The code `print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))` prints the elements of the `additional_marks` list, which are converted to strings and joined with spaces. This operation does not change the values of the variables, but it outputs the contents of `additional_marks`.

The output of this line will be the elements of `additional_marks` separated by spaces. However, since no new values are assigned to any of the variables, the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and `additional_marks` remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is the last element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list that contains all unique elements `i + j` such that `i + j \leq l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`. The contents of `additional_marks` are printed.**
