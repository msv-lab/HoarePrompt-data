Postcondition: ***`i` is the second element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`. If `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in the `marks` list, then `additional_marks` contains the elements from before plus `i + j`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
