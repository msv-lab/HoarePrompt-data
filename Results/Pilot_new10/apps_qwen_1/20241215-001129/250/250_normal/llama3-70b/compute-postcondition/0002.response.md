`need_x` and `need_y` are assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `marks` remain unchanged from their initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `l` is an integer such that `2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`, `marks` is a set of integers created from the input values, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`.**
