`additional_marks` is updated by appending the value of `i + j`. The value of `i + j` is not explicitly given, but it is known to satisfy the conditions `i + j \leq l` and `i + j` is not in the `marks` list. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`, `y`, and `i + j`, `i + j \leq l` and `i + j` is not in the `marks` list**
