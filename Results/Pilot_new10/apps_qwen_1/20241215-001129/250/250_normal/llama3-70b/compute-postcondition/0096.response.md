Postcondition: ***`i` is the third element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` has at least 2 elements, and if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`, then `additional_marks` now contains an additional element which is `i + j`. Otherwise, `additional_marks` remains unchanged.***
