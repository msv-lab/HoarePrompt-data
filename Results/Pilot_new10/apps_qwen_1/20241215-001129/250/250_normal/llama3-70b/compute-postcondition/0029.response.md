Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is `True`. The condition `marks[j] - marks[0] == x` holds, where `x` is the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[0]`. Additionally, if `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` is true, where `y` is the current difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]`, then the postcondition includes the state when this condition is met. If `marks[j] - marks[i] != y`, the postcondition does not change from the precondition.**
