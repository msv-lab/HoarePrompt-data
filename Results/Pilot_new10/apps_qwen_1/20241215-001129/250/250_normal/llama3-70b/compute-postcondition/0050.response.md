The code simply assigns `True` to `need_x`. The value of `need_y` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is \(n + 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`.

Output State: **`i` is \(n + 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`**
