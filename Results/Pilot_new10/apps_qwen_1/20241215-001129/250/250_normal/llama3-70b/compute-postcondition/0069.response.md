To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement.

Given States:
- `i` is the first element of the `marks` list.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `need_x` is `False`.
- `need_y` is `False`.
- `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`.
- `marks` is a non-empty list.

For-loop Statement:
```
for j in additional_marks:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `additional_marks` list.
2. **Variable `j`**: In each iteration, `j` takes on values from the `additional_marks` list. The loop will continue until all elements in `additional_marks` are processed.

Since `additional_marks` is explicitly mentioned as a list containing `x` and `y`, we know that `additional_marks` contains at least two elements (x and y).

3. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - `i` being the first element of `marks` and `j` being `n-1` are not directly relevant to the loop condition since the loop iterates over `additional_marks`.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` being `False` are not directly relevant to the loop condition either.
   - `marks` being a non-empty list is not relevant here since the loop only iterates over `additional_marks`.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed for the loop to execute is ensuring that `additional_marks` has at least one element (since the loop iterates over this list).

State: **`i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`, and `additional_marks` must have at least one element.**

Final State:
**`i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`, and `additional_marks` must have at least one element.**
