The code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. The values of `i` and `j` are taken from the initial state, where `i` is the third element of the `marks` list and `j` is the second-to-last element of the `additional_marks` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `i` and `j` are taken from their respective positions, the new value added to `additional_marks` is `i + j`. All other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is the third element of the `marks` list, `j` is the second-to-last element of `additional_marks`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, the `additional_marks` list now has one more element which is `i + j`, and `additional_marks` has at least 2 elements.**
