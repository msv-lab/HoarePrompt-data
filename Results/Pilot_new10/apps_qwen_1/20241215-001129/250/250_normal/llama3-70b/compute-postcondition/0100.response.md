Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `i` is the third element of the `marks` list.
   - `j` is the second-to-last element of `additional_marks`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if `i + j <= l` and if `i + j` is not already in `marks`.
   - If both conditions are met, `additional_marks` gains one more element which is `i + j`.
   - If either condition is not met, `additional_marks` remains unchanged and still has at least 2 elements.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the second-to-last element of `additional_marks`.
   - Since we are considering the next iteration, `j` will now be the last element of `additional_marks`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:

- `i` remains the same as it is part of the `marks` list and does not change within the loop.
- `j` becomes the last element of `additional_marks` from the second-to-last element.
- `need_x` and `need_y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is the third element of the `marks` list.
- `j` is the last element of `additional_marks`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `need_x` is `False`.
- `need_y` is `False`.

State: **`i` is the third element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`**
