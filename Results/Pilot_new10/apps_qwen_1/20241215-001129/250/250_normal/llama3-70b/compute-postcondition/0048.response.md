Postcondition: ***`i` is \(n + 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`. If the condition \(marks[j] - marks[i] == y\) holds, the function ensures that \(marks[j] - marks[i]\) is updated to \(y\). Otherwise, the condition \(marks[j] - marks[i] \neq x\) still holds.***
