Postcondition: ***`i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`. If `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, `additional_marks` becomes a list containing `x`, `y`, and `i + j`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `additional_marks` still being a list containing `x` and `y`.***
