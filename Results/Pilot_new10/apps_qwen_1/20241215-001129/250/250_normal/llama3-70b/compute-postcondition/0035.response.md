According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from `i` to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and `marks[2] - marks[0] == x` holds. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will start with `j = 2` and increment `j` by 1 each time until it reaches `n`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented to 2.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `i` remains 1 because `i` is the starting point of the range and does not change within the loop.
- `j` starts at 2 (since `j` is incremented starting from 2).
- `n` remains the same since it defines the upper limit of the range.
- `need_x` and `need_y` remain `True` unless the loop body changes these values.
- The condition `marks[2] - marks[0] == x` remains unchanged unless the loop body changes this value.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, `j` is 2, and `marks[2] - marks[0] == x` holds.**
