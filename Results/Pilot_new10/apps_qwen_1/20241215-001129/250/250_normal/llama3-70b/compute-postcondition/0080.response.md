According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the list `marks`. The loop iterates over each element in the `marks` list, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in the `marks` list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is the first element of the `marks` list.
- `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `need_x` is `False`.
- `need_y` is `False`.
- `additional_marks` is a list that may contain elements `x`, `y`, and any valid `i + j` where `i + j \leq l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the second element of the `marks` list.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i` is the second element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list that may contain elements `x`, `y`, and any valid `i + j` where `i + j \leq l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`**.
