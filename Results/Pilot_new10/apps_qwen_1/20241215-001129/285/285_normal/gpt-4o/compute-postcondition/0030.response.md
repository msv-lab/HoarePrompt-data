Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `b` (which is being iterated over) is within the range `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - `a` is some variable, but its value is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `remaining_after_cars` must be greater than or equal to 0 and `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` in the range from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

3. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - Since `b` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the next value of `b` would be `b + 1`.
   - Therefore, `b + 1` must be less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` to allow the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `remaining_after_houses` remains the same as it does not depend on `b`.
- `b` will be increased by 1, so the new value of `b` will be `b + 1`.
- `remaining_after_cars` remains the same as it does not depend on `b`.
- The condition `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0` remains unchanged.

So, the new state should reflect that `b` is increased by 1 and the loop can continue if `b + 1` is still within the valid range.

**Final State:**
State: **`remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0, `b` is `b + 1`, `a` is some variable, `remaining_after_cars` must be greater than or equal to 0 and `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0.**
