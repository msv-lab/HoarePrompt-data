`remaining_after_houses` is calculated as `n - a * house_cost`. The value of `a` is incremented by 1 in the process. The initial conditions state that `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` if the loop returns 'YES', and the other variables (`total`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

After executing the code, the value of `a` is updated to `a + 1`, and `remaining_after_houses` is updated to `n - (a - 1) * house_cost`.

Output State: **`remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` if the loop returns 'YES', otherwise the loop does not return anything; `remaining_after_houses` is `n - (a - 1) * house_cost`; `total`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, and `n` remain unchanged; `a` is incremented by 1.**
