The code updates the value of `remaining_after_cars` by subtracting `b * car_cost` from `remaining_after_houses`. Given the initial state:

- `a` is 1
- `remaining_after_cars` is `n - house_cost`
- `b` is 1
- `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`
- `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`

The code sets `remaining_after_cars` to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Since `b` is 1, this simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - car_cost`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`**
