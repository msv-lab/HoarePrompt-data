According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. The variable `b` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (2b + 1) * car_cost`.

To determine the state for the next iteration:

1. **Increment `b`:** Since the loop increments `b` by 1 in each iteration, after the previous iteration, `b` was the value it had at the end minus 1. For the next iteration, `b` will be incremented by 1.

2. **Update `remaining_after_cars`:** The value of `remaining_after_cars` is calculated as `remaining_after_houses - (2b + 1) * car_cost`. After the previous iteration, `b` was some integer value, say `b_old`. Therefore, `remaining_after_cars` was `remaining_after_houses - (2b_old + 1) * car_cost`.

   For the next iteration, `b` becomes `b_old + 1`, so `remaining_after_cars` will be updated to `remaining_after_houses - (2(b_old + 1) + 1) * car_cost = remaining_after_houses - (2b_old + 3) * car_cost`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `b` will be `b_old + 1`.
- `remaining_after_cars` will be `remaining_after_houses - (2(b_old + 1) + 1) * car_cost`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (2(b + 1) + 1) * car_cost`, and `b` is `b + 1`**.
