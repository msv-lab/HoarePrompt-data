To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is 1
   - `b` is 1
   - The condition `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0` determines if the function returns 'YES'. However, since this condition is not directly related to the loop, we can focus on the loop itself.

2. **Loop Information:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` in the range from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `b` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state needs to be adjusted such that `b` is 2, while `a` remains unchanged (still 1).

**State: **`a` is 1, `b` is 2**
