The code `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` updates the value of `remaining_after_cars` based on the existing values of `remaining_after_houses`, `b`, and `car_cost`. However, since the specific values of these variables are not given in the initial state, we can only describe the relationship between the variables.

- `remaining_after_houses` is a variable.
- `b` is a variable.
- `car_cost` is a variable.

After executing the code, `remaining_after_cars` is updated to be `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.

Output State: **`remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is a variable, `b` is a variable, `car_cost` is a variable**
