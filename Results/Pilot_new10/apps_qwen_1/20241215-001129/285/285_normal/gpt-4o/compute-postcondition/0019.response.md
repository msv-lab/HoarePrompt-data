Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:
   - `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` if the loop returns 'YES'.
   - The variables `total`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, and `n` remain unchanged.

2. **Understand the for loop**:
   ```python
   for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over values of `a` starting from 0 up to `n // house_cost`.
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must be less than `n // house_cost + 1`.

4. **Identify the change needed**:
   - Since the loop increments `a` with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` needs to be incremented and checked against `n // house_cost + 1`.
   - Therefore, `a` must be less than `n // house_cost + 1` for the next iteration to occur.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variables `total`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, and `n` remain unchanged.
   - The new value of `a` should be `a + 1`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` if the loop returns 'YES', otherwise the loop does not return anything. The variables `total`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` is `a + 1`**. 

Since the exact value of `a` is not specified, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` if the loop returns 'YES', otherwise the loop does not return anything. The variables `total`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` is incremented by 1**.
