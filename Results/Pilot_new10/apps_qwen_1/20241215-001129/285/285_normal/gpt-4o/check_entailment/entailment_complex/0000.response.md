Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score. The input handling is correct and within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` checks if it's possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins by buying a combination of houses (1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (123 456 game-coins each), and computers (1 234 game-coins each). It uses nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` (representing the number of houses, cars, and computers respectively) to see if any combination satisfies the equation:
   \[
   a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n
   \]

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop iterates over all possible values of `a` (from 0 to `n // 1234567`).
   - For each value of `a`, the inner loop iterates over all possible values of `b` (from 0 to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`).
   - For each combination of `a` and `b`, the program calculates the remaining amount `remaining_after_cars` and checks if it is divisible by the cost of a computer (`1234`). If it is, the function returns 'YES', indicating that a valid combination exists.

4. **Return Value**:
   - If no combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfies the equation, the function returns 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the problem description precisely. Therefore, the program is correct.
