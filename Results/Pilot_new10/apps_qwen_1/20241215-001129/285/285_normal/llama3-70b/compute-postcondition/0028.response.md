The print statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply outputs the string 'YES'. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is the previous value of `b` plus 1, `c` is \((n - 1 * 1234567 - (b + 1) * 123456) // 1234\), and the string 'YES' is printed.**
