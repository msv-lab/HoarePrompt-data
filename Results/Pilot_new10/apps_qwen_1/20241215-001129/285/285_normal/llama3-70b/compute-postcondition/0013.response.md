Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 123456.
   - `c` is -98.
   - `b` is equal to \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 + 1\).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for values of `b` in the range \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 + 1\).

3. **Loop Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
     - `n` must be greater than or equal to 123456 (unchanged).
     - `c` is still -98 (unchanged).
     - `b` has just completed its current value.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `b` must be less than \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 + 1\).
   - Since `b` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be incremented by 1.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `n` remains the same: `n` must be greater than or equal to 123456.
   - `c` remains the same: `c` is -98.
   - `b` is incremented by 1, so `b` will be \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `c` is -98, `b` is \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456\)**.
