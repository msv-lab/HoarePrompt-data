The code snippet prints 'YES', but this does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `c`, and `b`. The value of `c` is updated to -98, and `b` remains unchanged according to the previous definition. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `c` is -98, `b` is equal to \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 + 1**
