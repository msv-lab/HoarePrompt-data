Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `c` is -98, `b` is \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456\), `c` is \((n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456) // 1234\). If \(a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n\), the equation holds true. Otherwise, the values of `b` and `c` remain as per their definitions based on `n`, `a`, and `123456`.***
