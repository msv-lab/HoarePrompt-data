The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without further execution of any subsequent code. This means that no changes are made to the variables, and the program ends.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `c` is `(n - 1 * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
