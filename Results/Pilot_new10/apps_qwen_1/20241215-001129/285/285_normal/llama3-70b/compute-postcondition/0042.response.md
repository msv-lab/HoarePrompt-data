The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately without executing any further code. Therefore, no changes are made to the variables, and the conditions and values before the `exit()` call remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2469134, `a` is 2, `c` is ((`n` - 2469134 - `b` * 123456) // 1234), and the equation (`a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`) equals `n`; print output is 'YES'**
