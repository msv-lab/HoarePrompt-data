Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2,469,134, `a` is 2, `b` is \( b_k + 2 \), `c` is \(\left( n - 2716046 - 123456b_k \right) // 1234\). If the expression `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, no change occurs. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
