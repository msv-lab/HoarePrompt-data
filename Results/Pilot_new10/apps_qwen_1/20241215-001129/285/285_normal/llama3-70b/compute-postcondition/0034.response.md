The code `exit()` simply exits the program without changing any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is `b_prev + 1`, `c` is \(\left( n - 1234567 - (b_prev + 1) * 123456 \right) // 1234\)**
