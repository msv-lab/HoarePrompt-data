The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `c` is `(n - 1 * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
