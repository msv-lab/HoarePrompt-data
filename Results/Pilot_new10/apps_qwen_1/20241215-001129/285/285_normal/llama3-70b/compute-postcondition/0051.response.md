The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables; it only prints 'YES' to the console. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their original values from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2,469,134, `a` is 2, `b` is \( b_k + 2 \), `c` is \(\left( n - 2716046 - 123456b_k \right) // 1234\)**
