The code `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console. However, this operation does not change the values of the existing variables. Therefore, the only impact is that the string 'YES' is printed, but the values of `n`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and the equation remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `c` is equal to (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234, and the equation (a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234) equals `n', and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
