Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins by buying houses, cars, and computers. The program iterates over possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` (the number of houses, cars, and computers respectively) and checks if the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n` holds true. If such a combination exists, it prints 'YES' and exits. If no such combination exists after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'. The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints and follows the problem description accurately.
