Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly iterates through all possible combinations of houses (`a`), cars (`b`), and computers (`c`) to check if there exists a combination that sums up to `n`. The logic within the loops ensures that all potential cases are considered, and the program prints "YES" if a valid combination is found and "NO" otherwise. The original assessment is accurate because the program handles all possible inputs within the specified constraints and provides the correct output based on the problem description.
