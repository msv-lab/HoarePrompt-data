Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether Kolya's initial game-coin score `n` can be spent entirely by buying houses, cars, and computers. The program iterates through possible numbers of houses (`a`), cars (`b`), and computers (`c`) and checks if the combination satisfies the equation \(a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n\). If such a combination exists, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO". 

Given the constraints and the approach used, the program correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or potential inputs where the program would fail to produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
