Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has directed edges to, `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack during depth-first search, respectively. After executing the if-else block, if `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, the function returns True. If it returns False, the function continues without changing the state of the variables.***
