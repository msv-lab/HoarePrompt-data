According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the `graph[node]` list. The loop will execute if there are any neighbors in the list. Given the current state:

- `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
- `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has directed edges to.
- `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack during depth-first search, respectively.
- `visited[node]` is `True`.
- `rec_stack[node]` is `True`.

The loop will only execute if `graph[node]` contains at least one element (i.e., there are neighbors for the given node). Therefore, we need to ensure that `graph[node]` is not empty.

State: **`total` is unspecified, `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has directed edges to, `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack during depth-first search, respectively, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, `graph[node]` must contain at least one element.**
