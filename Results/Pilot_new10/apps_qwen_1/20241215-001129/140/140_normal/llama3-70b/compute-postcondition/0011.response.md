Postcondition: **`total` is unspecified, `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has directed edges to, `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack during depth-first search, respectively, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, `graph[node]` must contain at least one element. If `visited[neighbor]` is False, `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` is called, and if it returns False, then `visited[neighbor]` is still False. If `visited[neighbor]` is True, `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False.**
