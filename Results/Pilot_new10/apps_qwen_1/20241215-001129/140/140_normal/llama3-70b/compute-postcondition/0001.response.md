`rec_stack[node]` is assigned the value `True`. This means that the node is added to the recursion stack during a depth-first search. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph; `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has directed edges to; `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack during depth-first search, respectively; `visited[node]` is True; `rec_stack[node]` is True.
