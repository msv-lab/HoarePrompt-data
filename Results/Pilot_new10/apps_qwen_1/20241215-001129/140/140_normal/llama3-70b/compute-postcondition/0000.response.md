The code `visited[node] = True` sets the value of `visited[node]` to `True`. This means that the node has been visited in the context of a depth-first search. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph; `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has directed edges to; `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack during depth-first search, respectively; `visited[node]` is True.**
