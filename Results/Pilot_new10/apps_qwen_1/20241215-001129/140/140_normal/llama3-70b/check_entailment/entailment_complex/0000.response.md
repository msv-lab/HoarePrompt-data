Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether a given directed graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Graph Representation and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of vertices \( n \) and edges \( m \) from the input.
   - It initializes a list of adjacency lists (`graph`) to represent the directed graph.
   - For each edge, it adds the destination vertex to the adjacency list of the source vertex.

2. **Cycle Detection with Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The program uses a recursive DFS approach to detect cycles in the graph.
   - It maintains two arrays: `visited` and `rec_stack` to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack, respectively.
   - The function `func_1` performs a DFS starting from a given node. If it detects a cycle (i.e., a back edge that points to a node already in the recursion stack), it immediately returns `True`.

3. **Checking Cycles**:
   - For each node, the program checks if removing any edge incident on that node would result in an acyclic graph.
   - If a cycle is detected for a node by removing an edge, the program stops further processing and sets `has_cycle` to `True`.
   - If no cycle is found after checking all nodes, the graph is considered acyclic.

4. **Output**:
   - If a cycle is detected, the program prints `NO`.
   - If no cycle is detected, the program prints `YES`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection Logic**:
  - The `func_1` function correctly identifies cycles using DFS. When a back edge is encountered (i.e., a neighbor that is already in the recursion stack), a cycle is detected.
  
- **Edge Removal Check**:
  - For each node, the program checks if removing any edge incident on that node would result in an acyclic graph. This ensures that the removal of at most one edge is considered.
  
- **Edge Removal Validation**:
  - The program simulates the removal of each edge by temporarily marking it as not present in the adjacency list. This ensures that the graph is checked for cycles with each possible single edge removed.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program efficiently handles the constraints (up to 500 vertices and 100,000 edges) by performing a DFS for each node, ensuring the algorithm runs within acceptable time limits.

Given that the program correctly implements the described logic and handles all cases as per the problem statement, the program is indeed correct. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **True**
