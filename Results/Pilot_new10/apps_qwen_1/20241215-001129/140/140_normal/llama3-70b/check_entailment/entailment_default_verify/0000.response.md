Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program only detects cycles in the graph but does not attempt to remove any edges to check if the graph can become acyclic. The function `func_1` correctly identifies cycles, but the main logic of the program does not address the requirement of checking if the graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the problem requirements as stated.
