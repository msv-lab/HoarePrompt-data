Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. The `func_1` function first checks if the graph is already acyclic. If not, it iteratively removes each edge, checks if the graph becomes acyclic, and returns 'YES' if any removal makes the graph acyclic. If none of the edge removals make the graph acyclic, it returns 'NO'. This matches the problem description and the output hints provided. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
