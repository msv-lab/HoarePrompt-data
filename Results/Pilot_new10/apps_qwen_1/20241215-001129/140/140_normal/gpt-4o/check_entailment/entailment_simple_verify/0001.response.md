Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. The `func_1` function first checks if the graph is already acyclic. If not, it iteratively removes each edge, checks if the graph becomes acyclic, and restores the edge if it does. This ensures that the program can accurately identify whether removing one edge can eliminate all cycles. The `has_cycle` function correctly identifies cycles using topological sorting, ensuring that the overall logic is sound. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
