Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the output hints. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Graph Construction**: The code constructs the graph using the given edges and checks if the graph initially contains a cycle using the `has_cycle` function.

2. **Cycle Removal Check**: If the graph initially does not contain a cycle, it immediately returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it attempts to remove each edge temporarily and checks if the graph still contains a cycle. If removing any edge results in a graph without a cycle, it returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Cycle Detection Function**: The `has_cycle` function uses Kahn's algorithm to detect cycles by counting the in-degrees of the vertices. If the number of nodes processed equals the number of nodes, there are no cycles; otherwise, there is at least one cycle.

Given these points, the code correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description and the provided examples. There are no edge cases or scenarios that the code fails to address within the constraints provided. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
