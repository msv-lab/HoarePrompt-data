The function `has_cycle` accepts a graph represented as a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to. It also accepts integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. The function determines whether the graph contains at least one cycle by checking the in-degrees of the vertices. It returns `True` if there is at least one vertex with an in-degree not equal to 0, indicating the presence of a cycle, and `False` otherwise.
