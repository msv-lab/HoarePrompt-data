The function `has_cycle` accepts a parameter `graph`, which is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to. Additionally, it accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, which are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether not all nodes have an in-degree of 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `has_cycle` is to accept a graph represented as a dictionary, along with the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `m`, and return a boolean indicating whether there exists at least one node with a non-zero in-degree.
