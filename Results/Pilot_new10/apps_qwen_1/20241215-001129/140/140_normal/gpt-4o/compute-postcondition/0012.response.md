According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `graph[u]`. For the loop to execute again, `graph[u]` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `graph[u]` must contain at least one element.
- `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must be an element in `graph[u]`, and therefore `graph[u]` must still contain at least one element. Since `in_degree[v]` was incremented by 1 during the previous iteration, it is no longer relevant for determining if the loop can execute again.

So, we only need to ensure that `graph[u]` contains at least one element for the loop to continue.

State: **`graph[u]` must contain at least one element**
