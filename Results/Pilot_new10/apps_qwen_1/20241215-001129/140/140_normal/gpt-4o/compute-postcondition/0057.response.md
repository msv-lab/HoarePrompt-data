According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `neighbor` within the list `graph[node]`. The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `graph[node]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions are true:
- `graph[node]` is a non-empty list.
- `queue` contains the next leftmost element.
- The `neighbor` was appended (implying the current `neighbor` is now the next one to be processed).
- `in_degree[neighbor]` is -1, indicating that this condition is checked but not modified further by the loop body.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next `neighbor` must be available in `graph[node]`. Since `graph[node]` is a list, the next `neighbor` will be the next element in the list.

Given that `neighbor` was appended in the previous iteration, the next `neighbor` is now the one that would be processed in the current iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the `neighbor` value moves to the next element in `graph[node]`.

State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` contains the next leftmost element and the new `neighbor` appended, `in_degree[new_neighbor]` is -1**
