The code decrements the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[node]` must include the next `neighbor`, `queue` includes the next `neighbor`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 (i.e., `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1`), and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`graph[node]` must include the next `neighbor`, `queue` includes the next `neighbor`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `count` is increased by 1.**
