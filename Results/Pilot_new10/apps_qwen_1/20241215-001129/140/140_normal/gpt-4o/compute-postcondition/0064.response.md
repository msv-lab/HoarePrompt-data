`count` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` is the original queue without the leftmost node, `in_degree[neighbor]` is -1 for all neighbors of the removed node, and `in_degree[original_neighbor]` retains its original value for other neighbors; `count` is increased by 1.
