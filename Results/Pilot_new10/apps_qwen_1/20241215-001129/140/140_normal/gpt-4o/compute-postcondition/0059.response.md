The code appends the `neighbor` to the `queue`. The `queue` now contains its previous elements plus the `neighbor`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` contains the next leftmost element, `neighbor`, and the new `neighbor`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is the original value minus 1, `in_degree[new_neighbor]` is -1**
