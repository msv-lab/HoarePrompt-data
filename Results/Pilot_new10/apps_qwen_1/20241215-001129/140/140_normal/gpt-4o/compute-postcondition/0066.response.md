The code decrements `in_degree[neighbor]` by 1. Since `in_degree[neighbor]` was initially -1 for all neighbors of the removed node, decrementing -1 will result in -2. For other neighbors, the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` is the original queue without the leftmost node, `in_degree[neighbor]` is -2 for all neighbors of the removed node and retains its original value for other neighbors; `count` is increased by 1**
