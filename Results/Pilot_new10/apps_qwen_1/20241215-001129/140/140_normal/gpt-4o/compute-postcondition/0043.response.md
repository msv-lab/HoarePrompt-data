Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary where `node` is a key and the corresponding value is a non-empty list; `queue` contains nodes such that for each node, `in_degree[next_neighbor]` has been decremented by 1, and `next_neighbor` has an in-degree of 0, and now includes `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0 before the decrement; `in_degree[neighbor]` is -1; `queue` now includes `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0 before the decrement, and `queue` must still contain at least one node with an in-degree of 0 or whose in-degree was reduced to 0. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the if part's postcondition.***
