The code initializes a queue with nodes (vertices) that have an in-degree of 0. This means that these nodes have no incoming edges. The queue is created using a list comprehension that iterates over the keys in the `in_degree` dictionary and checks if the value (in-degree) for each key is 0.

Since the `in_degree` dictionary is updated based on the outgoing edges from each vertex, the nodes added to the queue are those that do not have any incoming edges. The `graph` dictionary and its structure remain unchanged, and the `n` and `m` variables retain their original values without any changes.

Output State: **`graph` remains a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to; `n` and `m` remain as originally defined; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to an integer representing the total number of incoming edges to that vertex; `queue` is a deque containing nodes (vertices) with an in-degree of 0.**
