The code decrements the `in_degree` of the `neighbor` by 1. The initial state specifies that `graph` is a dictionary where `node` is a key and the corresponding value is a non-empty list, and `queue` contains nodes such that for each node, `in_degree[next_neighbor]` has been decremented by 1 and `next_neighbor` has an in-degree of 0. If `in_degree[next_neighbor]` becomes 0, `next_neighbor` is added to the queue.

After executing `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1`, the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where `node` is a key and the corresponding value is a non-empty list; `queue` contains nodes such that for each node, `in_degree[next_neighbor]` has been decremented by 1, and `next_neighbor` has an in-degree of 0. If `in_degree[next_neighbor]` becomes 0, `next_neighbor` is added to the queue; `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.**
