The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1 for each `v` in `graph[u]`. Given the initial state where `graph[u]` must be non-empty and contain at least two nodes, and `in_degree[v]` for each `v` in `graph[u]` is incremented by 1, the value of `in_degree[v]` for each `v` in `graph[u]` will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[u]` must be non-empty and contain at least two nodes; for each `v` in `graph[u]`, `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1; each `v` in `graph[u]` will be processed at least once.**
