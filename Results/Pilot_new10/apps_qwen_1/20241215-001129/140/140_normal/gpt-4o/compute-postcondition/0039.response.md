Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary where `node` is a key and the corresponding value is a non-empty list; `queue` contains nodes such that for each node, `in_degree[next_neighbor]` has been decremented by 1, and `next_neighbor` has an in-degree of 0. If `in_degree[next_neighbor]` becomes 0, `next_neighbor` is added to the queue; `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1; `queue` now includes `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0.***
