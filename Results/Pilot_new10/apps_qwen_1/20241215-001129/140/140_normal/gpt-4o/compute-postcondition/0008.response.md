Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `graph`: A dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to.
- `n` and `m`: Integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\) and \(1 \leq m \leq \min(n(n - 1), 100000)\), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.
- `in_degree`: A dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to 0.

### For Loop Statement
```python
for u in graph:
    for v in graph[u]:
        in_degree[v] += 1
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `u`:**
   - The outer loop iterates over the keys in the `graph` dictionary.
   - For the outer loop to start executing, there must be at least one key in the `graph` dictionary.

2. **Variable `v`:**
   - The inner loop iterates over the elements in the list `graph[u]`.
   - For the inner loop to start executing, the outer loop must be running, and `graph[u]` must contain at least one element.

3. **Variable `in_degree`:**
   - The `in_degree` dictionary keeps track of the in-degrees of the vertices.
   - Each time an edge `(u, v)` is encountered, `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1.

### Final State After All Iterations
- **Graph:** The `graph` dictionary remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
- **n and m:** These variables also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **in_degree:** After all iterations of the loop, `in_degree[v]` for each vertex `v` will be equal to the number of incoming edges to that vertex. This means `in_degree[v]` will be the total number of edges directed towards vertex `v`.

### Conclusion
The loop will execute for each vertex `u` in the graph and for each outgoing edge from `u` to `v`. The `in_degree` dictionary will be updated accordingly.

**Final Output State:**
- `graph` remains a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to.
- `n` and `m` remain as originally defined, but they do not change.
- `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to an integer representing the total number of incoming edges to that vertex.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary of vertices and their outgoing edges, `n` and `m` are the same as initially defined, and `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to the total number of incoming edges to that vertex.**
