The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Since the initial value of `in_degree[v]` is 2, after executing this line, `in_degree[v]` will become 3. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u` is a valid key in `graph`, and `graph[u]` contains at least one element; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to 0 except for `v` and the new `v`, which are both mapped to 1; `in_degree[v]` is 3**
