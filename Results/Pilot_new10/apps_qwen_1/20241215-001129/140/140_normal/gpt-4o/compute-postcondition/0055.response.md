The code appends the `neighbor` to the `queue`. The `neighbor` was previously the next leftmost element in `graph[node]`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` was -1, indicating it hasn't been processed yet. After executing `queue.append(neighbor)`, the `queue` will contain this `neighbor`.

Output State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` contains the next leftmost element and the `neighbor` appended, `in_degree[neighbor]` is -1**
