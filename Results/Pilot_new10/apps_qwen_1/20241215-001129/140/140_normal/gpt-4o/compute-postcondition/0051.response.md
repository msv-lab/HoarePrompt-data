`queue` is appended with the `neighbor`. The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is already decreased by 1 and is equal to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` contains the leftmost element (previously did not contain), `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.

Output State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` contains the leftmost element, `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0**
