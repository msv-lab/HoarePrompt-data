According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph[u]` list. The loop can execute as long as `graph[u]` is non-empty and contains at least one node. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[u]` must be non-empty and contain at least one node, `u` remains the same node, `in_degree[v]` for each `v` in `graph[u]` is incremented by 1, and each `v` in `graph[u]` will be processed at least once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[u]` must still be non-empty and contain at least one more node (since one node was already processed in the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`graph[u]` must be non-empty and contain at least two nodes, `u` is the same node, `in_degree[v]` for each `v` in `graph[u]` is incremented by 1, and each `v` in `graph[u]` will be processed at least once.**
