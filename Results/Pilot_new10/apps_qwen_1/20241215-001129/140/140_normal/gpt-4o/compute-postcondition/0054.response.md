`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` was previously 0, so after executing the code, it becomes -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` contains the next leftmost element (the next `neighbor` from `graph[node]`), `in_degree[neighbor]` is -1.

Output State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` contains the next leftmost element (the next `neighbor` from `graph[node]`), `in_degree[neighbor]` is -1**
