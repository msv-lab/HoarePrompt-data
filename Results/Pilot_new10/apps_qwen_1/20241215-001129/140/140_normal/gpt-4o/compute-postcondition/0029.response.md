`node` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue` using `popleft()`, which removes and returns the leftmost element from the `deque`. The `queue` is updated to remove this element. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`graph` remains a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to; `n` and `m` remain as originally defined; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to an integer representing the total number of incoming edges to that vertex; `queue` is a deque containing nodes (vertices) with an in-degree of 0 excluding the node that was just removed; `count` is 0; `node` is the leftmost element of the original `queue`.**
