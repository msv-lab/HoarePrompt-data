To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

### Code Analysis:
The provided code is as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

1. The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
2. It uses a generator expression that generates even integers starting from 2 to `2*n` (inclusive). 
3. For each of these integers, it computes the cube (`i ** 3`) and sums them up.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function should return the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to `2*n`, inclusive.

### Testing the Function:
To check the validity of the function, let's run through a few test cases:
- **Test case with n = 0:** 
  - The expected output would be `0` since there are no even numbers to sum. The code returns `sum([])` which correctly results in `0`.
  
- **Test case with n = 1:** 
  - The expected output would be `2^3 = 8`. The code processes `range(2, 3)` which only includes `2`, correctly returning `8`.

- **Test case with n = 2:** 
  - The expected values to include are `2` and `4`. The output should be `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`. The code evaluates it correctly using `range(2, 5)`.

- **Test case with n = 3:** 
  - The expected values are `2, 4, 6`. The output should be `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`. The code evaluates this using `range(2, 7)` and returns `288`.

From the checks performed, the function appears to work correctly for the provided test cases and includes all even integers up to `2*n`.

### Conclusion:
Since the code correctly computes the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers for all tested cases and no edge cases arise with the non-negative integer constraint, we conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The function accurately sums up the cubes of even integers from 2 to `2*n` inclusive, as required by the problem description.
