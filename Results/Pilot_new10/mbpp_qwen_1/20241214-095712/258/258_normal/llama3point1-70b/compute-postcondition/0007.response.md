To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Initial State Information:**
   - `num` is an integer.
   - `num_str` is a string representation of `num` and must have at least one character.
   - `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1.
   - `sum` is the cumulative sum of the digits of `num_str` with the additional value of the current digit raised to the power of `num_len`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for digit in num_str:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each character (digit) in `num_str`.
   - Each iteration processes one digit from `num_str`.

4. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Letâ€™s denote the current digit being processed as `current_digit`.
   - After processing this `current_digit`, `sum` includes the contribution of `current_digit` raised to the power of `num_len` (the length of the remaining string after removing the current digit).

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop is about to process the next digit, the string `num_str` will lose one character.
   - `num_len` will decrease by 1 because it is based on the length of `num_str`.
   - `sum` will need to be updated to exclude the contribution of the current digit (since it is moving to the next iteration).

6. **New State Before the Next Iteration:**
   - `num_str` will have one less character than before.
   - `num_len` will be decreased by 1.
   - `sum` will be adjusted to exclude the contribution of the current digit.

Given the above analysis, the new state should reflect these changes:

**State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, `sum` is the cumulative sum of the digits of `num_str` without the current digit raised to the power of the new `num_len`**.
