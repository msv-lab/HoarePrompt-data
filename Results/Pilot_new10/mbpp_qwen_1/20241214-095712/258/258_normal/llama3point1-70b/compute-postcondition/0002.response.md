The code initializes the variable `sum` to 0, but does not affect the values of `num`, `num_str`, or `num_len`. The value of `sum` is set to 0, which is a specific value.

Output State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `num`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str`; `sum` is 0**
