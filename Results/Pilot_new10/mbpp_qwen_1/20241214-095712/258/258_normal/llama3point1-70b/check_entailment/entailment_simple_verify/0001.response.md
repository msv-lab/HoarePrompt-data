Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. The function converts the number to a string, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and compares this sum to the original number. The annotations clearly show that the function behaves as expected and handles the calculation accurately for any positive integer. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.
