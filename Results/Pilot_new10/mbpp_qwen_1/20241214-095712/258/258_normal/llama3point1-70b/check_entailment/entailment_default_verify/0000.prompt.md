You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program checks if a number is an Armstrong number, but it does not correctly implement the logic for Armstrong numbers. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

The current implementation calculates the sum of the digits raised to the power of the length of the string representation of the number, but it does not correctly handle the number of digits. The variable `num_len` should be the number of digits in the number, not the length of its string representation. 

For instance, consider the number 1634:
- The correct calculation should be \(1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4\).
- However, the program incorrectly calculates \(1^1 + 6^1 + 3^1 + 4^1\).

To fix this, the code should calculate the power using the actual number of digits, which can be obtained by converting the number to a string and getting its length:

```python
def is_armstrong(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

This corrected version will correctly identify Armstrong numbers.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `num`, converts it to a string, and calculates the sum of each digit in the string representation of `num` raised to the power of the length of the string. If the calculated sum equals `num`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
