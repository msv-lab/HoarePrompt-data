Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Conversion to String**: The program converts the input integer `num` to a string using `str(num)`. This allows access to individual digits.
2. **Length Calculation**: The length of the string representation of `num` is calculated using `len(num_str)`, which gives the number of digits in `num`.
3. **Sum Calculation**: A loop iterates over each digit in `num_str`, converting it back to an integer and raising it to the power of `num_len` (the number of digits), then adding it to the cumulative sum `sum`.
4. **Comparison and Return**: After the loop, the program checks if the calculated sum (`sum`) is equal to the original number (`num`). If they are equal, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Since the program accurately follows the steps required to determine if a number is an Armstrong number according to the provided problem description, the program is correct.
