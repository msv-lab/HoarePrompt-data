The code calculates the length of the string `num_str`. Since `num_str` is a string representation of the positive integer `n`, the length of `num_str` is the number of digits in `n`.

Let's denote the number of digits in `n` as `d`. Therefore, `num_len` will be equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`**
