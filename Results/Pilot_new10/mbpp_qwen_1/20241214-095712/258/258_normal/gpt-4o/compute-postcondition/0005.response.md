Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`, and returns whether this sum is equal to `n`.**

This summary covers the following aspects:
- The function accepts a positive integer `n`.
- It converts `n` to a string representation (`num_str`).
- It calculates `num_len`, which is the number of digits in `n`.
- It computes `armstrong_sum` as the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.
- It returns whether `armstrong_sum` is equal to `n`.

No edge cases or missing functionality were identified based on the provided code and annotations.
