Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function converts the number to a string, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and returns whether this sum is equal to the original number. The assertions provided also validate the function with different inputs, including a known Armstrong number (153) and two non-Armstrong numbers (259 and 4458), which confirms the function works as intended for these cases. Since the function follows the problem description and the provided examples and assertions work correctly, the program is correct.
