Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer based on the problem description.
2. **String Conversion**: The number `n` is converted to a string using `str(n)`, allowing easy access to each digit of the number.
3. **Length Calculation**: The length of the string (i.e., the number of digits in `n`) is calculated using `len(num_str)`.
4. **Armstrong Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits. This is done using a generator expression within the `sum` function.
5. **Comparison and Return**: The function returns `True` if the calculated sum (`armstrong_sum`) is equal to the original number `n`, indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The assertions provided in the code also validate this logic:
- `func_1(153)` should return `True` because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).
- `func_1(259)` should return `False` because \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 \neq 259\).
- `func_1(407)` should return `True` because \(4^3 + 0^3 + 7^3 = 407\).

Since the program correctly implements the logic for checking Armstrong numbers and the provided test cases pass, the program is correct according to the problem description.
