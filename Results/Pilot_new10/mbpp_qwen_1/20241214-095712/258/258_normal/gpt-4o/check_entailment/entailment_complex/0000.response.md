Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` as input, which is consistent with the problem description.
2. **String Conversion**: It converts the integer `n` to a string using `str(n)`. This allows us to iterate over each digit easily.
3. **Digit Count**: It calculates the number of digits in `n` using `len(num_str)`, ensuring the correct power for each digit.
4. **Armstrong Sum Calculation**: It computes the sum of each digit in `n` raised to the power of the number of digits using a generator expression inside `sum()`.
5. **Comparison**: Finally, it compares the calculated `armstrong_sum` with the original number `n` and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number, otherwise it returns `False`.

The provided test cases also validate the function:
- `assert func_1(153) == True`: 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153, so 153 is an Armstrong number.
- `assert func_1(259) == False`: 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 8 + 125 + 729 ≠ 259, so 259 is not an Armstrong number.
- `assert func_1(4458) == False`: 4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 = 256 + 256 + 625 + 4096 ≠ 4458, so 4458 is not an Armstrong number.

Since the program logic matches the problem description and the test cases confirm its correctness, the program is indeed correct.
