The code calculates the median of the `merged_list` by taking the average of the two middle elements. Since `middle_index` is `size - 1`, the two middle elements are `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`, which are the last element and the first element of the second half of the list, respectively. The median is computed as their average.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`merged_list` is a sorted list of integers formed by merging and sorting `list1` and `list2`; `list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (`size`), and `size` is a positive integer; `middle_index` is `size - 1`; `median` is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`.**
