Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the two lists are empty or when the size is 0. Additionally, the code assumes that the input lists are of the same size and are sorted, which is correct according to the problem description. However, the code does not handle the case when the size of the lists is even and the elements at the indices `size - 1` and `size` in the merged list are the same. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider two lists `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]` both of size 2. The merged and sorted list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The median would be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, but the code would return 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
