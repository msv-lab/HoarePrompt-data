Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the program has an issue with calculating the median for lists of even size due to the incorrect setting of `middle_index`. However, the annotated version of the code clearly shows that the `middle_index` is set to `size - 1`, which is indeed incorrect for calculating the median of an even-sized list. The correct approach should use `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2` as the middle indices. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be corrected as provided in the explanation.
