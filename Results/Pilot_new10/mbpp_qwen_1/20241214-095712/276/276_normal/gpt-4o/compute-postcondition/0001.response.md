The code assigns the value of the midpoint index of `merged_list` to the variable `mid`. Since `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with a size of `2n`, the length of `merged_list` is `2n`. The midpoint index is calculated using integer division, which means `mid` will be `n`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with size 2n, `mid` is n**
