Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the task described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.
   
2. **Function Definition and Input Validation**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `list1` and `list2`, both of which are sorted lists of integers, and an integer `n` representing the size of each list. Since both lists are guaranteed to be of the same size (`n`), no explicit validation is required for this condition.

3. **Merging Lists**:
   - The function merges `list1` and `list2` into a single sorted list `merged_list`. This is done using the `sorted()` function, which ensures that the resulting list is sorted.
   - Merging two sorted lists in this manner maintains the sorted order, which is essential for finding the median.

4. **Finding the Median**:
   - The length of the `merged_list` is computed.
   - Depending on whether the length of `merged_list` is even or odd, the median is calculated accordingly:
     - If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
     - If the length is odd, the median is the middle element.
   - The calculation of the median is correct because the middle elements (or the middle one if the number of elements is odd) are accurately identified.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
     - An even-length merged list (e.g., `[1, 12, 15, 26, 38]` and `[2, 13, 17, 30, 45]` results in a median of `16.0`).
     - An odd-length merged list (e.g., `[2, 4, 8, 9]` and `[7, 13, 19, 28]` results in a median of `8.5`).
     - Another example with an even-length merged list (e.g., `[3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42]` and `[2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55]` results in a median of `25.0`).

Given these points, the program correctly finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size, adhering to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
