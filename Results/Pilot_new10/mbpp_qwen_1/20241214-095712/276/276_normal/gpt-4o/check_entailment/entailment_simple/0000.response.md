Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Validation**: The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists (`list1` and `list2`) of the same size (`n`). The problem description does not explicitly require any input validation, but the function adheres to the assumption that the lists are sorted and have the same size.

2. **Merging and Sorting**: The function merges the two input lists into one (`merged_list`) and then sorts it. Since the input lists are already sorted, this step ensures that the combined list is also sorted.

3. **Finding the Median**: 
   - If the total number of elements (`2n`) is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements.
   - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element directly.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed median, which aligns with the requirement to return the median value of the combined list.

The provided test cases verify that the function works correctly for different inputs:
- For `[1, 12, 15, 26, 38]` and `[2, 13, 17, 30, 45]`, the median is `16.0`.
- For `[2, 4, 8, 9]` and `[7, 13, 19, 28]`, the median is `8.5`.
- For `[3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42]` and `[2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55]`, the median is `25.0`.

Given that the function correctly handles the merging, sorting, and calculation of the median based on the size of the combined list, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
