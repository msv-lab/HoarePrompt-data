Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists, sorts them, and then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness. The annotated version clearly shows that the function handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list correctly, and the return value is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
