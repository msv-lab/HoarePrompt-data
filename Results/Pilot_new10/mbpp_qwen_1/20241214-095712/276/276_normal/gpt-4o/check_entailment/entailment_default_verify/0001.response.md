Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists, sorts them, and then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. The provided test cases confirm its correctness for different scenarios, including even and odd lengths. The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the function, and there is no indication that the function fails to meet the problem description for any potential case under the assumption of valid inputs. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
