Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and apply the `sorted()` function to sort the elements within each sublist. The provided test cases cover various scenarios including different lengths of sublists, spaces in string elements, and different characters (like 'z' vs 'g'). Since the function works correctly for these cases and the logic is sound, it should handle any other potential case similarly. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
