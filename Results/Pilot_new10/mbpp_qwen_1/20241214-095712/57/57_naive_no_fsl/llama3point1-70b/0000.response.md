Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists using `str.lower` as the key, which ensures case-insensitive sorting. Given the problem description, there doesn't appear to be any edge cases or inputs that would make this function incorrect. The list comprehension iterates through each sublist and applies the `sorted` function with the specified key, producing the correct output for all typical and atypical cases that can be thought of.
