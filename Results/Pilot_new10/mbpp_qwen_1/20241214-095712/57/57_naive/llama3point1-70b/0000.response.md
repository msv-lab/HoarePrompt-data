Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists correctly. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and applies the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` to sort the strings case-insensitively. Given the problem description, this implementation handles all potential cases where the sublists can contain any number of strings, including empty sublists or sublists with a single element. There are no edge cases identified where this function would fail to meet the requirements.
