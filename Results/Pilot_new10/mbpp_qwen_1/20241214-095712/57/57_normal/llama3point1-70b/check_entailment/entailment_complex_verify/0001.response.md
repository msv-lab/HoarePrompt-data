Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the behavior of the function `func_1`. It correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists using `str.lower` as the key, ensuring case-insensitive sorting. The original assessment is accurate because the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and the annotations confirm this behavior.
