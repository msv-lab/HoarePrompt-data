Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists based on the lowercase version of the strings. The `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. Given this, the code meets the problem description for every potential case where the input is a list of lists containing strings. There are no edge cases or examples provided in the hints that indicate the code is not handling some cases correctly.
