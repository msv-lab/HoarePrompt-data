Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted()` function to sort the elements in ascending order. The assert statements provided confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Since the function handles sorting for each sublist as required by the problem description and passes all the provided test cases, it is correct.
