Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the provided assertions confirm that the program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to apply the `sorted` function to each sublist, ensuring that all elements within each sublist are sorted alphabetically. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including sublists with different lengths and sublists containing strings with leading spaces. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
