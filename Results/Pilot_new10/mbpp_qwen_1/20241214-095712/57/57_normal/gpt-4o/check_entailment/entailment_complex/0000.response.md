Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (where each inner list contains strings) and returns a new list where each inner list is sorted in ascending order. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes one parameter, `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings. This matches the input requirement specified in the problem description.

2. **Sorting Sublists**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted()` function to sort the elements within each sublist. This ensures that each sublist is sorted in ascending order.

3. **Output**: The function returns a new list where each sublist is sorted, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs, including those with spaces in the strings and different letter cases.

Since the function `func_1` meets all the criteria specified in the problem description and passes the provided test cases, the program is correct.
