Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The assertions provided in the problem description cover various scenarios, including sublists with different lengths and varying initial order of elements. The function uses a list comprehension to apply the `sorted` function to each sublist, ensuring that all strings within each sublist are sorted in ascending order. Since the examples given in the problem description and the provided assertions all yield the correct outputs, the function appears to handle every potential case as described.
