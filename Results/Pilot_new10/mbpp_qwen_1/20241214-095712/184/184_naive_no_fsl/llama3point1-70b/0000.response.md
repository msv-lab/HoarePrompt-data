Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` filters out odd numbers from a list of integers using a list comprehension. The function checks each number `num` in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if `num % 2 != 0`, which means the number is odd. This logic correctly implements the requirement to filter odd numbers.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases (i.e., it correctly filters odd numbers from any given list of integers), the program is correct.
