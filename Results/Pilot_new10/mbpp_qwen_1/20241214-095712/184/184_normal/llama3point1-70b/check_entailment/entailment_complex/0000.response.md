Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The list comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]` iterates over each number in `nums` and includes it in the result list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). This exactly matches the problem description which states that the function should filter odd numbers from the given list of integers. The function always returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list `nums`, thereby meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
