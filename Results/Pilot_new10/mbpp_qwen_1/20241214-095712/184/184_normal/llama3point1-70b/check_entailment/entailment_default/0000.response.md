Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It filters out even numbers and returns a list containing only the odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The list comprehension iterates through each number in `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). This approach works for every potential case without any missing logic or edge cases.
