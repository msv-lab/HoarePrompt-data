The annotated code indicates that the function `func_1` accepts a list of integers named `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. Let's break down the code and ensure we cover all potential cases:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `num` in the input list `nums`.
2. For each `num`, it checks if `num % 2 != 0` (i.e., if the number is odd).
3. If the condition is true, the number is included in the resulting list.

Given this, the code accurately describes the functionality without any missing or incorrect logic. The annotation aligns perfectly with the code.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from `nums`.**
