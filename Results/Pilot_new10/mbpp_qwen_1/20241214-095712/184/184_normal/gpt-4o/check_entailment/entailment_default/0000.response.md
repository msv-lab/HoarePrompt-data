Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly filters out odd numbers from the given list. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected for various inputs, including lists with even and odd numbers, and lists with a mix of even and odd numbers. Since the code satisfies the problem description for all the cases provided and the logic is sound, the correctness is **True**.
