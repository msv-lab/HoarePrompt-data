Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as intended for filtering odd numbers. There are no contradictions or issues indicated by the annotations that would suggest the function is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is correct.
