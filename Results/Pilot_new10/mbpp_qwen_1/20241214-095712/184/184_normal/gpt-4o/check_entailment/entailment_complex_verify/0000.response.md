Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list, and the provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with multiple odd and even numbers, lists with only odd or even numbers, and lists with a mix of odd and even numbers. Since the annotated version aligns with the original assessment and the provided test cases confirm the function's correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
