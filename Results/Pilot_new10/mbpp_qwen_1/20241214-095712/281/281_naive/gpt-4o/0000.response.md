Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns all even numbers from a given list. The list comprehension checks each number in the input list and includes it in the result if it is even (`num % 2 == 0`). The function passes the provided test cases and appears to handle all potential cases correctly, as it will work for any list of integers. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
