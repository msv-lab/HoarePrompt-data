Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from a list of integers, as indicated by the output hints. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list and includes only those numbers that are divisible by 2 (i.e., even numbers). The original assessment is accurate because the function behaves as expected for the given test cases and the output hints confirm that it handles the intended functionality correctly.
