Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both accurately reflect the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
