Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly filters out and returns only the even numbers from the input list. The annotations clearly state that the function processes a list of integers and returns a list of even numbers, which matches the problem description. The provided assertions also confirm that the function works as intended for the given examples. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
