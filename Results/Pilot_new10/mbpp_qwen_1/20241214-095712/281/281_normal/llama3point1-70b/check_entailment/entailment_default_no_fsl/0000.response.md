Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and includes it in the result list only if it is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). Since this logic correctly identifies and filters out even numbers, the function works as expected for every potential case described by the problem statement.
