Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. 

- The function iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`.
- It uses a list comprehension to filter out numbers that are not even (`num % 2 != 0`).
- Only numbers that satisfy the condition `num % 2 == 0` (i.e., even numbers) are included in the resulting list.
- Therefore, the function consistently returns a list of even numbers from the original list, meeting the requirement specified in the problem description for all possible inputs.
