Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` iterates through each number in the input list `numbers`, checks if the number is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`), and includes it in the output list if the condition is met. This ensures that the function always returns a list of even numbers from the original list, no matter what the contents of the input list are. Therefore, the program is correct.
