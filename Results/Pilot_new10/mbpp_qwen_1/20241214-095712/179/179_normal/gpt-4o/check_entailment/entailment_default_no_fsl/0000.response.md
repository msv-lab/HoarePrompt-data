Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function generates a list of the first `n` even numbers using a list comprehension and then computes the cube sum of these numbers. The assertions provided in the problem description confirm that the function works correctly for `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`. Since the function handles the general case and the provided test cases match the expected behavior, the function appears to be correct for every potential case.
