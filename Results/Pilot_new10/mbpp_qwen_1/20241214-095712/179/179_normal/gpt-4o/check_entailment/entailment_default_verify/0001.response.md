Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning 0, which aligns with the output hints. The provided test cases and the explanation in the original assessment confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given problem description. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is incorrect.
