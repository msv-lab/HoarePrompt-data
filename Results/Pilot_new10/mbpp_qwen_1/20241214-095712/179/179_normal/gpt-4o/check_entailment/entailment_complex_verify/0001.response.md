Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly computes the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The provided assertions also validate this behavior for different values of `n`. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
