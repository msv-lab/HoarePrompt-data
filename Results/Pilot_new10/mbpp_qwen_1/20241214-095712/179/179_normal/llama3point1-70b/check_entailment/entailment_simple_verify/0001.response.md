Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function iterates over the even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`, computes their cubes, and sums them up. The annotations match the functionality described in the problem statement, and the original assessment correctly identified that the function meets the requirements without any issues.
