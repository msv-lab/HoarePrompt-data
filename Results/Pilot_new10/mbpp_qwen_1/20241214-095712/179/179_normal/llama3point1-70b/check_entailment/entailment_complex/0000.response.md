Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the problem description. The function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

- The function uses a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` to generate the cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`.
- The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers in the sequence: 2, 4, 6, ..., up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`, ensuring that exactly the first `n` even numbers are considered.
- The `sum()` function then calculates the sum of these cubes.

Since the function correctly implements the logic to find the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers for any positive integer `n`, the program is correct according to the problem description.
