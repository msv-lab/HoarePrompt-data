Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original program both correctly describe the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers as specified in the problem description. The generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` correctly generates the cubes of the even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`, and the `sum()` function correctly computes their sum. Since the annotations match the intended behavior and the original assessment concluded that the program is correct, the original assessment remains accurate.
