Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The provided output hints also confirm that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`. The function works as expected for the given problem description and the provided test cases. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the given implementation.
