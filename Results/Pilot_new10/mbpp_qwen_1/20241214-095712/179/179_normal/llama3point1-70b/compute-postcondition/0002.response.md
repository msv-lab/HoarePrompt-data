Let's analyze the annotated code step by step to determine the functionality of the function `func_1`.

1. **Initial State**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The function uses a generator expression to iterate over even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`.
   - For each even number `i` in the range, it computes `i ** 3` (the cube of `i`).
   - These values are summed up using the `sum` function.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the sum of these cubes.

4. **Postconditions**:
   - The function returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly sums the cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`.
- There are no edge cases mentioned or potential missing functionalities in the given code.

### Summary:
- The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`.**
