Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` generates the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers, and the `sum()` function adds them up. This approach works for all positive integer values of `n`. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the given problem description.
