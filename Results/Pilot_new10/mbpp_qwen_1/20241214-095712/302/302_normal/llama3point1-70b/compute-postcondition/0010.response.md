Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is an integer, and `i` is either the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` or `len(arr)`, and `x` is the element in `arr` at index `i` (if `i < len(arr)`), and the function returns `i` if `x == num`, otherwise it returns `None`.**
