Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly iterates through the sorted array and returns the index of the first occurrence of the given number. If the number is not found, it returns `-1`. The annotated version clearly shows that the function behaves as intended, iterating through the array and returning the correct index or `-1` if the number is not present. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
