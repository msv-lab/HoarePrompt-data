Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array, and when it finds the first occurrence of the number `num`, it returns the index. If the number is not found, it returns `-1`. The annotated version confirms that the function handles all possible cases and aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
