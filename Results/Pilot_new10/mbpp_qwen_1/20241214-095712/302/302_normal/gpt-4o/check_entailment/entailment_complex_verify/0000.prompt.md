You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The logic within the `while` loop correctly narrows down the search range based on whether the middle element is equal to, less than, or greater than the target value. When the target value is found, the program updates the `result` to the current index and continues to search in the lower half of the array to ensure it finds the first occurrence. This approach handles the requirement accurately for the provided test cases and, in general, for any sorted array where the target number exists. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the problem description and the given examples.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is the index of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise it remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is -1, `mid` is -1
    return result
    #The program returns -1 since `result` remains -1 as no search process has been conducted and `target` might not be in `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:Let's analyze the provided annotated code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target`, an integer.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and `len(arr) - 1`, respectively. The variable `result` is initialized to -1.
3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - Inside the loop, the middle index `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, `result` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is set to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, `high` is set to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
4. **Post-loop State**: After the loop, `result` contains the index of `target` if found, otherwise it remains -1. `low` and `high` are set to 0 and -1, respectively, and `mid` is set to -1.
5. **Return Statement**: The function returns `result`.

From the code, we can observe that the function performs a binary search on the sorted list `arr` to find the index of `target`. If the target is found, it returns the index; otherwise, it returns -1.

**Analyze Potential Edge Cases**:
- **Empty List**: If `arr` is empty, `low` will never be less than or equal to `high`, so the loop will never run, and `result` will remain -1.
- **Single Element**: If `arr` has only one element and it matches `target`, the function will return the index of that element.
- **Target Not Found**: If `target` is not present in `arr`, the function will return -1.

Given the return postconditions and the actual code, the functionality of the function is correctly described in the initial annotation. However, it is important to note that the function returns -1 if the target is not found, regardless of whether a search process was conducted or not.

**Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the index of `target` in `arr`. If the target is found, it returns the index; otherwise, it returns -1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
