Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The function takes a sorted list `arr` and an integer `target`. The list is assumed to be sorted in non-decreasing order, which is a valid precondition for binary search.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The function initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the middle index `mid`.
   - If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, it updates `result` to `mid` and sets `high` to `mid - 1` to ensure that the function returns the first occurrence of the target (binary search modifies `high` to search in the left half).
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, it sets `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, it sets `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
   - After the loop, if the target is found, `result` will contain the index; otherwise, it will remain -1.

3. **Post-loop Condition**: The function returns `result`, which is the index of the first occurrence of the target if found, otherwise -1. This behavior aligns with the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty List**: If `arr` is empty, the loop condition `low <= high` fails immediately, and `result` remains -1.
   - **Single Element**: If `arr` has only one element, the function checks if it matches `target` and returns the index if true.
   - **Target Not Found**: If the target is not in the list, the loop exits without finding a match, and the function returns -1.

Given that the function correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles all edge cases as expected, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
