Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function handles all the provided test cases and follows the problem description accurately. The original assessment is accurate because the function correctly identifies the first occurrence of the target number if it exists, and returns -1 if it does not. The annotations support this behavior, showing that the function's logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
