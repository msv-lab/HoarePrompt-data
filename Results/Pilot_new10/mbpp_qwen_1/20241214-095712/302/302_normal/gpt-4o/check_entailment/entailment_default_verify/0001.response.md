Final: **False**

Reason: Although the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement a binary search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, the original assessment is not entirely accurate. The provided test cases only cover specific scenarios where the target number appears multiple times in the array. However, the function's logic only updates the `result` variable when it finds the target number and immediately searches in the left half of the array (`high = mid - 1`). This means that if the target number appears multiple times, the function will still return the index of the first occurrence, which is correct. However, the original assessment does not account for the possibility that the target number might not appear at all in the array. In such a case, the function should return `-1`, which is the expected behavior and matches the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to reflect this understanding, and the function is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
