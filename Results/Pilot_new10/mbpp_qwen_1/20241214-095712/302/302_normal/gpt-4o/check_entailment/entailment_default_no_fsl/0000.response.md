Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not handle the case when the input array `arr` is empty. According to the problem description, the function should accept a sorted array and find the index of the given number. However, the function does not account for the scenario where the array is empty, leading to incorrect behavior. For an empty array, the function should return -1, but since the loop condition `low <= high` is checked, the function will immediately exit without entering the loop, and `result` will still be -1, which is the correct behavior. Therefore, the function should work correctly for an empty array as well.
