`high` is reassigned to `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, this assignment directly updates the value of `high`. The other variables (`arr`, `target`, `result`, `low`, `mid`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is `mid`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is `mid - 1`**
