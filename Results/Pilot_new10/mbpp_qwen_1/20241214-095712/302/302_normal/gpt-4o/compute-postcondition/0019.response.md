The variable `high` is reassigned to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, so after the reassignment, `high` becomes `(low + (low + high) // 2) - 1`. However, the exact new value of `high` cannot be simplified without knowing the specific values of `low` and `high`. The other variables (`arr`, `target`, `result`, `low`, `mid`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is -1, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `high` is `(low + (low + high) // 2) - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
