The code assigns `-1` to the variable `result`. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `target`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the only change is that `result` is now `-1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1**
