The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target`, which is an integer. The function returns -1 since `result` remains -1 as no search process has been conducted and `target` might not be in `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`, and if the search process is not conducted (i.e., `result` remains -1), it returns -1.
