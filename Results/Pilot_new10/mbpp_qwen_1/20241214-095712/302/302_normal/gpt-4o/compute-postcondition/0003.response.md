The code calculates the midpoint index `mid` of the range defined by `low` and `high`. The value of `mid` is updated based on the formula `(low + high) // 2`, but the actual values of `low` and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only variable affected is `mid`, which is now set to the midpoint index.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
