The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. The values of `high`, `target`, `result`, and `arr` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is the index of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise it remains -1, `high` is the same as before, `low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `result` is the same as before.**
