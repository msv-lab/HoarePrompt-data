Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through the sorted array `arr` using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If it finds an element equal to `num`, it immediately returns the index. If no such element is found, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the function finds the first occurrence of the given number in the sorted array, which aligns with the problem description. Since the function handles all elements in the array and returns the correct index or `-1` if the number is not found, it works correctly for all potential cases.
