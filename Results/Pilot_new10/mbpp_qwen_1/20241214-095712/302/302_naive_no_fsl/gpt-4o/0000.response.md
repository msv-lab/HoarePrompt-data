Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function handles all the provided test cases and follows the problem description accurately. Since the binary search algorithm used in the function is designed to find the first occurrence of the target number, and the provided assertions cover various scenarios, we can conclude that the function works correctly for the described problem. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues that the current implementation is missing based on the given information.
