Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(d, n)` correctly filters the dictionary `d` to only include entries where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the desired key-value pairs. Since the function accurately implements the described functionality for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
