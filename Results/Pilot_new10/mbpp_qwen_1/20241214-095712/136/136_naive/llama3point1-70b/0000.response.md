Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value meets the condition. This approach handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Since no edge cases or examples were found where the program does not meet the requirements, the function is correct.
