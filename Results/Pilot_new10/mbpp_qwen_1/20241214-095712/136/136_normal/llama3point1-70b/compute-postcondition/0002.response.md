The annotated code indicates that the function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` where the values are integers and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The annotation accurately describes the behavior of the code.

To summarize the functionality:

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where the values are integers and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.**
