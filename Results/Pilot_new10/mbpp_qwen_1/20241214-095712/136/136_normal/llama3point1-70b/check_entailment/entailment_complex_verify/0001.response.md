Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1(d, n)` correctly filters the dictionary `d` to include only entries where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the desired key-value pairs. Given the problem description and the annotated code, the function meets the requirements and there are no inaccuracies in the original assessment.
