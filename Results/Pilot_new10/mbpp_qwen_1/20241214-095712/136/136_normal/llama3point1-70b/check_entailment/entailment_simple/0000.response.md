Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs. It then creates and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This behavior matches the requirement specified in the problem description, which states that the function should filter the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`.

Since the program consistently produces the expected output for any valid input dictionary and integer, it is correct according to the given problem description.
