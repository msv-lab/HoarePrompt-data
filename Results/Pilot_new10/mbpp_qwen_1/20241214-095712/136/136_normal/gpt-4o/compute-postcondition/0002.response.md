Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` and a comparable value `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This holds true for all potential cases, including dictionaries with non-comparable values for `n`, and considering that `n` can be any type that supports comparison (e.g., integers, floats).**
