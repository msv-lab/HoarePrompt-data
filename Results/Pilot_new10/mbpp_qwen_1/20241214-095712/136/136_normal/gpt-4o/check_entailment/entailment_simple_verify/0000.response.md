Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The annotated version confirms that the function creates a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value meets the criteria. The assertions provided cover various scenarios and validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
