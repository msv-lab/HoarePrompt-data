Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to filter a dictionary based on a threshold value `n`. The output hints accurately describe the function's behavior, stating that it accepts a dictionary and a comparable value `n`, returning a new dictionary with key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The original assessment is accurate as the function meets the problem description for all provided examples and potential cases, given the assumption of valid inputs.
