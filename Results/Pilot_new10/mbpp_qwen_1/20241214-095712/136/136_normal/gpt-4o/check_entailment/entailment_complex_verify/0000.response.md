Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes that the function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The provided assertions cover various scenarios and the logic within the function is sound. The function returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from the input dictionary `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. Since the function works correctly for all the provided test cases and the logic appears sound, the program is correct for the given problem description.
