Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the dictionary, which correctly implements the required functionality.

The assertions provided in the code cover various scenarios:
- Filtering out keys with values less than 170.
- Filtering out keys with values less than 180.
- Filtering out keys with values less than 190.

Additionally, the problem description and output hints indicate that the function should work for any type of value in the dictionary as long as it supports comparison, and the code does not rely on any specific type of dictionary values. Therefore, the provided code meets the requirements for every potential case described.
