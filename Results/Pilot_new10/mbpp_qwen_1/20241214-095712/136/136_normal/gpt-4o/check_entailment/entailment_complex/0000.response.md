Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for different input scenarios. The dictionary comprehension used within the function ensures that only the entries meeting the condition `v >= n` are included in the returned dictionary. This meets the requirement specified in the problem description for all potential cases where the dictionary values are comparable.
