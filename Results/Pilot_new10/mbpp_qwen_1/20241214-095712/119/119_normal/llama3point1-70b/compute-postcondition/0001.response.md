The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are numbers, which can be either integers or floats. After executing the function body, the function returns the values of `b` and `a` as a tuple.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are numbers (integers or floats), and return a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are numbers (integers or floats), and returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a`.**
