Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1(a, b)` returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in that order. This exactly matches the problem description, which asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The original assessment was accurate because the function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description without any contradictions or missing logic.
