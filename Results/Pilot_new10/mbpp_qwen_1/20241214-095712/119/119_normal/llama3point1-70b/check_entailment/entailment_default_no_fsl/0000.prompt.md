You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.
Program:
```
def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)


```
Output hints: Let's analyze the provided annotated code and the return postconditions step by step:

### Annotated Code Analysis
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    # The program returns the values of `b` and `a` as a tuple
```

### Return Postconditions
The program returns the values of `b` and `a` as a tuple.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which can be either integers or floats.
2. **Return Value**: The function directly returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in that order.
3. **Annotations**: The comment states that the function returns the values of `b` and `a` as a tuple, which aligns perfectly with the actual code.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic
- There are no complex operations or conditional statements in the function. Therefore, there are no edge cases to consider beyond the general behavior described.
- The function does exactly what it is annotated to do without any missing functionality or contradictions.

### Summary
Given the analysis, the function `func_1` simply swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them as a tuple.

### Functionality
**The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which can be integers or floats, and returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a`.**

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
