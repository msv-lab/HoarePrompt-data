Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(a, b)` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. This behavior matches the problem description for any pair of input numbers. The output hints confirm that the function works as expected for valid inputs, and there are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail according to the given problem statement.
