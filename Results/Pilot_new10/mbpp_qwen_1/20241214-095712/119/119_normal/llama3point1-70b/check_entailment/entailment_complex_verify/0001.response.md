Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1(a, b)` returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, which exactly matches the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail as long as the inputs are valid numbers. Therefore, the function works correctly for all potential cases described by the problem statement, making the original assessment accurate.
