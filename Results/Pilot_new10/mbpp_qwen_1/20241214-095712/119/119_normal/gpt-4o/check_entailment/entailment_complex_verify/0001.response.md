Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the provided assertions clearly demonstrate that the function `func_1` takes two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The original assessment correctly states that the function implementation `return (b, a)` matches the required behavior, and the provided test cases confirm its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
