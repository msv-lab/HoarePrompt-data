Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly swaps the order of the two input numbers and returns them as a tuple. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function returns `b` and `a`, which aligns with the requirement to return the second number followed by the first number. The original assessment is accurate as the function behaves as expected for the given test cases.
