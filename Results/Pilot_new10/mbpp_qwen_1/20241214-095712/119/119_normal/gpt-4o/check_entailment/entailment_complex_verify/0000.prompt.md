You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)
assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)

def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input parameters and returns them as a tuple. The examples given (`assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)`, `assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)`, `assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)`) all demonstrate the expected behavior. Given the nature of the function, which simply swaps two values, it is clear that the function will always work as intended for any pair of inputs. Therefore, there are no potential cases where this program would fail to meet the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)
assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns `b` and `a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which can be integers or floats, and returns them in the order of `b` followed by `a`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
