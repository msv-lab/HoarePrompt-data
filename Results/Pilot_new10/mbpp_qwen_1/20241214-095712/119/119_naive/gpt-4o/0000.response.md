Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input parameters and returns them as a tuple. The examples given (`assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)`, `assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)`, `assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)`) all demonstrate the expected behavior. Given the nature of the function, which simply swaps two values, it is clear that the function will always work as intended for any pair of inputs. Therefore, there are no potential cases where this program would fail to meet the problem description.
