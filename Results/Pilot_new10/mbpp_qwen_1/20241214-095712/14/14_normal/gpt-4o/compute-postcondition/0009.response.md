The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. Since the initial state only tells us that `arr` is a list containing at least two integers and does not provide any information about `num` or `seen`, we assume that `seen` is initially an empty set. After running the code, `num` will be added to this set.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least two integers; `seen` is a set containing `num`; no return value.**
