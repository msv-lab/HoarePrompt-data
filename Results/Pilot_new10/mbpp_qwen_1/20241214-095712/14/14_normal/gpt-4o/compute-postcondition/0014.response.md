Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing all integers from `arr`, and the function returns `False` if no duplicate was found in `arr`.** 

Explanation:
- Initially, `arr` is a list of integers, and `seen` is an empty set.
- The loop iterates over each `num` in `arr`.
- If `num` is in `seen`, the function returns `True`, indicating a duplicate was found.
- Otherwise, `num` is added to `seen`.

Since the question asks for the state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we consider two scenarios:
1. No duplicates were found: In this case, `seen` will contain all integers from `arr`, and the function will return `False` because no duplicates were encountered.
2. A duplicate was found: In this case, the function would have returned `True` during the iteration where the duplicate was found, and the loop would have terminated without reaching its full iteration count.

Thus, after all iterations, `seen` contains all integers from `arr`, and the function returns `False` only if no duplicates were found.
