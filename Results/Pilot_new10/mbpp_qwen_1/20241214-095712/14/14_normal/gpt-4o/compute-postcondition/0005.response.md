The code adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. Since `num` was initially not in `seen`, it is now added to it. The list `arr` and its first element `num` remain unchanged, and `seen` is now a set containing `num`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one integer, the first integer in `arr` is `num`, `seen` is a set containing `num`, and `num` is not in `seen` (this condition is no longer true)**
