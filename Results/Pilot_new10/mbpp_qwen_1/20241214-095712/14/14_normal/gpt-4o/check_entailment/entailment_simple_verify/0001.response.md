Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the presence of duplicates in the array using a set to track seen elements. The provided test cases are accurately described, and the logic of the function matches the problem description. The function works as expected for arrays with no duplicates, single duplicates, and multiple duplicates. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
