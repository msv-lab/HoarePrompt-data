Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if an array contains any duplicate elements. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to determine whether a given array (`arr`) contains any duplicate elements. This aligns with the problem description which asks for a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.

2. **Logic**: 
   - A set called `seen` is initialized to keep track of the elements that have been encountered so far.
   - The function iterates over each element in the array.
   - For each element, it checks if the element is already in the `seen` set.
     - If the element is in the set, it means the element is a duplicate, and the function immediately returns `True`.
     - If the element is not in the set, it adds the element to the `seen` set.
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False`: The array contains no duplicates, so the function correctly returns `False`.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]) == True`: The array contains a duplicate (the number 4), so the function correctly returns `True`.
   - `func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == True`: The array contains multiple duplicates, so the function correctly returns `True`.

Since the function accurately checks for duplicates and handles the test cases as expected, the program is correct according to the problem description.
