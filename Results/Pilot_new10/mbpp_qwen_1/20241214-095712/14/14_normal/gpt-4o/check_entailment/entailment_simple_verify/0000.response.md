Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment correctly concluded that the function `func_1` is accurate based on the provided problem description and test cases. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function initializes a set to keep track of seen numbers and iterates through the input array to check for duplicates. The function returns `True` as soon as a duplicate is found, which aligns with the problem description. The provided assertions validate the function's behavior across different scenarios, including arrays with and without duplicates. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
