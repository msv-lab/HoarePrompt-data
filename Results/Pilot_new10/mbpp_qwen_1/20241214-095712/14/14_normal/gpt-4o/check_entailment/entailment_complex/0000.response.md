Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks for the presence of duplicate elements in the input list of integers. It uses a set called `seen` to keep track of the numbers it has encountered so far. For each number in the input list, it checks if the number is already in the set. If it is, it immediately returns `True` indicating a duplicate was found. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

The assertions provided also validate different scenarios:
- The first assertion tests a list with no duplicates (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), and the function correctly returns `False`.
- The second assertion tests a list with a duplicate (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`), and the function correctly returns `True`.
- The third assertion tests a list with multiple duplicates (`[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`), and the function again correctly returns `True`.

Given that the program logic matches the problem description and the assertions pass all possible test cases, the program is correct.
