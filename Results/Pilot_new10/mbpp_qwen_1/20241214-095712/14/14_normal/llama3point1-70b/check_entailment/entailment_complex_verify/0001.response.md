Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the presence of duplicate elements in an array by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set created from the array. If the lengths differ, it indicates the presence of at least one duplicate element. The original assessment is accurate because the provided logic works for all potential cases where the input is a valid list of integers.
