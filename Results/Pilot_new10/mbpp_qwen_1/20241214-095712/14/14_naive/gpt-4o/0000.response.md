Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements using a set to track seen numbers. The function iterates through the array and checks if the current number is already in the set. If it is, a duplicate is found, and the function returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after iterating through the entire array, the function returns `False`.

The function works correctly for the given test cases:
- It returns `False` for `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, indicating no duplicates.
- It returns `True` for `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, indicating a duplicate `4`.
- It returns `True` for `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`, indicating multiple duplicates.

Since the function handles these cases correctly and appears to cover the necessary logic for identifying duplicates, we can conclude that it meets the problem description for every potential case.
