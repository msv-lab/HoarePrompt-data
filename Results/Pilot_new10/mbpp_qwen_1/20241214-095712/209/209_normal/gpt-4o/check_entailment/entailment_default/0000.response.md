Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by returning the first element of each sublist in the given list of sublists. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist and extract the first element. This approach works for all potential cases, including when sublists are empty, as the function will simply return `None` for those sublists. All provided assertions also confirm that the function works as expected for the given examples.
