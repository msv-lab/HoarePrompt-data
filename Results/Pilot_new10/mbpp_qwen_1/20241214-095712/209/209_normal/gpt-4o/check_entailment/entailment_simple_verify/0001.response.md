Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist within the input list. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. The original assessment is accurate because the function meets the requirement of retrieving the first element of each sublist without any issues. The annotations support this conclusion by detailing the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function operates as intended.
