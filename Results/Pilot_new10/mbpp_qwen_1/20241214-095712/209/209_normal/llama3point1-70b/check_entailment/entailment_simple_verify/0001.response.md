Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the functionality of the function `func_1`, which is to retrieve the first element of each sublist in the input list `sublists`. The original assessment correctly states that the function is correct for all potential cases, as it handles any non-empty sublists and any number of sublists without any additional constraints. The annotations further confirm that the function operates as intended, making the original assessment accurate.
