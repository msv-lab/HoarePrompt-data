Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by returning a list containing the first element from each sublist in the input list `sublists`. Since the function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and extract the first element, it works for any non-empty sublists. The function handles the case where sublists are empty by simply not including any elements from those sublists in the output, which is consistent with the problem description. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the provided code satisfies the requirement for every potential case described.
