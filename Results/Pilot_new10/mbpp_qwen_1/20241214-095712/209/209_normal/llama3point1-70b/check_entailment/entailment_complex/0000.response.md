Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sublists`, which is expected to be a list of sublists. The code then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `sublists` and extract the first element of each sublist. The resulting list of first elements is returned. This matches the problem description exactly, which states that the function should "get the first element of each sublist." The program handles all cases where `sublists` is a non-empty list of non-empty sublists. If either of these conditions is not met, an error might occur (e.g., if `sublists` is empty or contains empty sublists), but the problem description does not specify handling such edge cases, so the function is still considered correct based solely on the provided requirements.
