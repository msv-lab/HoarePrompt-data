Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly retrieves the first element of each sublist in the input list `sublists`. This works for any non-empty sublists and any number of sublists. Since the problem description does not specify any constraints on the length of the sublists or the overall list, and the function handles these cases correctly, the function is correct for all potential cases.
