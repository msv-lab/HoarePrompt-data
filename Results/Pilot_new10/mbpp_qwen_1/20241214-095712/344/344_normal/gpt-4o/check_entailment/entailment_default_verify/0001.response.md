Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly uses `bisect.bisect_right` to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The output hints clearly state that the function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which aligns with the behavior demonstrated in the test cases. The test cases cover typical scenarios, and there is no indication in the problem description or the output hints that the function should handle additional cases beyond those tested. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is valid.
