Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the problem description and the original assessment. The function `func_1` uses `bisect.bisect_right` to find the correct insertion point for a value in a sorted list, which matches the requirement. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
