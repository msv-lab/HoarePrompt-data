Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly uses `bisect.bisect_right` to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The annotations align with the functionality of the `bisect_right` method, which returns the insertion point for `value` in `sorted_list` to maintain sorted order. The provided test cases validate the function's behavior across different scenarios, confirming its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
