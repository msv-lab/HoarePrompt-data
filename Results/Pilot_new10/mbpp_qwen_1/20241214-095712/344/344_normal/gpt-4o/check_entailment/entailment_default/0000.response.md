Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function `func_1` returns the index where the value would fit to maintain the sorted order, which matches the problem description. The provided assertions cover different scenarios, including inserting a value greater than any in the list and inserting a value between existing elements. The code handles these cases correctly, and there are no obvious edge cases or potential issues that would cause it to fail for other inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
