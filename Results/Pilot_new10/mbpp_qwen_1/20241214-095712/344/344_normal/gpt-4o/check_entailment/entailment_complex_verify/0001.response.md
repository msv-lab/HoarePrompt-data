Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes that the function `func_1` uses `bisect.bisect_right` to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The provided assertions cover various scenarios and confirm the function behaves as expected. The annotated version aligns with the problem description and the behavior of the function, ensuring that it correctly returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. Thus, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is supported by the provided information.
