Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align with the problem description. The `func_1` function uses the `bisect_right` function to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the functionality of the function. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as intended for the given inputs. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
