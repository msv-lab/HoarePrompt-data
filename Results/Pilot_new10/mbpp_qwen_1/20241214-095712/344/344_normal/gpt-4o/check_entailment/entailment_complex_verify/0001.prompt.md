You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses `bisect.bisect_right` from the `bisect` module, which correctly finds the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is correct because `6` should be inserted at index `4`.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is correct because `3` should be inserted at index `2`.
3. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` returns `4`, which is correct because `7` should also be inserted at index `4`.

Since `bisect_right` handles edge cases and the provided examples cover typical usage, the function appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

import bisect

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer or float.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index in the sorted_list where the value would fit such that the sorted_list remains sorted (i.e., the rightmost place to insert value to keep the list sorted)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` of integers or floats and a value. It returns the index in `sorted_list` where the `value` would fit to maintain the sorted order. This index is the rightmost position where the value can be inserted without violating the sorted order of the list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
