Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value, and returns the smallest index `i` such that `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to the given value. If no such index exists (i.e., the value is greater than any element in the list), it returns the length of the list.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function accepts two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers or floats sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, which is also an integer or float.

2. **Loop Execution**: The function uses a for loop to iterate through each element in `sorted_list`. For each element, it checks if the element is greater than or equal to the given value.

3. **Return Logic**:
   - If the condition `sorted_list[i] >= value` is met at any point during the iteration, the function returns the index `i`.
   - If the loop completes without finding an element that satisfies the condition, the function returns the length of the list (`len(sorted_list)`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `value` is less than the first element of `sorted_list`, the function will not find any element that satisfies the condition, so it will return the length of the list.
   - If `value` is greater than or equal to the first element but less than the second element, the function will return the index `1`.
   - If `value` is greater than or equal to the last element, the function will return the length of the list.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, it meets the requirements of the problem description and is therefore correct.
