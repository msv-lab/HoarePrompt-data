Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function iterates through the list and returns the smallest index `i` such that `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`, or the length of the list if no such index exists. This matches the problem description accurately, and the original assessment of the function being correct is indeed accurate.
