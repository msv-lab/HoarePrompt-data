Output State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is the smallest index in `sorted_list` such that `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`, and if no such index exists, `i` is the length of `sorted_list`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through each element in `sorted_list` starting from the first element.
- It checks if the current element is greater than or equal to `value`.
- As soon as it finds an element that meets this condition, it returns the index of that element.
- If the loop completes without finding any element that meets the condition, it means that all elements in `sorted_list` are less than `value`. In this case, the function returns the length of `sorted_list`, indicating that `value` is greater than all elements in the list.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes executing, `i` will be the smallest index where `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`, or the length of the list if no such index exists.
