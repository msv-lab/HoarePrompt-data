Postcondition: ***`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, `value` is an integer or float, and `i` is 1. If `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns 1. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in the case where `sorted_list[i]` is less than `value`.***
