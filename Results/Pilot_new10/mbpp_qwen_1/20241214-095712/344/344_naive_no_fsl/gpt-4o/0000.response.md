Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses `bisect.bisect_right` from the `bisect` module, which correctly finds the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is correct because `6` should be inserted at index `4`.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is correct because `3` should be inserted at index `2`.
3. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` returns `4`, which is correct because `7` should also be inserted at index `4`.

Since `bisect_right` handles edge cases and the provided examples cover typical usage, the function appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
