Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. For each element in the list, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value. If it finds such an element, it returns the index. If no such element is found (i.e., all elements are less than the specified value), it returns the length of the list, which is the correct position to insert the value to maintain sorted order. This logic handles all potential cases without any missing conditions or edge cases.
