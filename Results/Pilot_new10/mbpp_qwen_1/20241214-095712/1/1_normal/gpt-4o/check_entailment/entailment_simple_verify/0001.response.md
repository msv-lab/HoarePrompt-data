Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly finds and returns the sorted common elements between two input lists. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including different orders of elements and lists with varying lengths. The function uses set operations to efficiently find common elements and returns them as a sorted tuple, which aligns with the problem requirements. The annotated version confirms that the function processes the lists as expected and produces the correct output. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
