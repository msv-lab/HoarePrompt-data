Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the common elements from the two input lists as a sorted tuple. The annotated version of the code clearly explains the process of finding common elements using set intersection and sorting, which aligns with the function's purpose as described in the problem statement. The assertions provided cover various scenarios and validate the function's behavior. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
