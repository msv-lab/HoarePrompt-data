The code creates a set called `common_elements` which contains the common elements between `list1` and `list2`. Since the exact values in the lists are not specified, we cannot determine the exact contents of `common_elements`. However, we know that `common_elements` will be a set containing only the elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`.

Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists, `common_elements` is a set containing elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`**
