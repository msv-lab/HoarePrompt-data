Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, as input parameters. It then converts these tuples into sets using the `set()` function, finds the intersection of these sets using the `&` operator, and finally converts the resulting set back into a tuple using the `tuple()` function. The function returns this tuple containing elements that are present in both input tuples. This exactly matches the problem description, which states that the function should find and return the shared elements from the given two lists (in this case, tuples). Therefore, the program is correct.
