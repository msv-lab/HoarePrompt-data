Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly finds and returns the shared elements from the given two tuples. The original assessment is accurate because the function uses sets to find the intersection of the two tuples and then converts the result back to a tuple, which handles all potential cases correctly. The annotations provided further confirm that the function behaves as expected by returning a tuple containing elements present in both input tuples.
