Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples, converts them to sets to find the intersection, and then converts the result back to a tuple. This approach correctly identifies the shared elements between the two tuples and handles all potential cases where elements might repeat in the input tuples. Since the function returns a tuple containing only the unique shared elements, it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
