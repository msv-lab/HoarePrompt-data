Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the unique elements that are present in both tuples using the set intersection operation. This directly aligns with the problem description, which asks to find the shared elements from the given two lists (tuples in this case).

The function uses `set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2)` to find the intersection of the two sets derived from the input tuples, ensuring that the result contains only unique elements that are present in both tuples. This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases like empty tuples or tuples with no common elements.

Since the function correctly implements the described functionality for every potential case, the correctness is **True**.
