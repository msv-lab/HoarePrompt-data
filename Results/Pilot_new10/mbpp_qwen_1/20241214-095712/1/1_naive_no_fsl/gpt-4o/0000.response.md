Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two lists as input and returns a tuple containing the sorted common elements between the two lists. The function uses set intersection (`&`) to find the common elements and then converts the result into a sorted tuple. 

The assertions provided cover various cases:
1. Both lists contain overlapping elements (4 and 5).
2. The order of elements in the lists is different but still contains the same elements (3 and 4).
3. The lists contain some overlapping elements with different orders (13 and 14).

Given these cases, the function appears to handle the problem correctly for the described requirements. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the provided information. Therefore, the function is correct.
