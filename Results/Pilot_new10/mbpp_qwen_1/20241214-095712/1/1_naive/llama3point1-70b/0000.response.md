Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) as input and returns a tuple containing the shared elements between them. This function uses sets to find the intersection of the two tuples and then converts the result back to a tuple.

The function works correctly for all potential cases where both input tuples contain elements of any type, including duplicates, since sets automatically handle duplicates and only retain unique elements. Here are a few examples to verify:

- For inputs `test_tup1 = (1, 2, 3, 4)` and `test_tup2 = (3, 4, 5, 6)`, the output is `(3, 4)`.
- For inputs `test_tup1 = ('a', 'b', 'c')` and `test_tup2 = ('b', 'c', 'd')`, the output is `('b', 'c')`.

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
