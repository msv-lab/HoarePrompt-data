Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the input string. The `replace` method in Python replaces all occurrences of the specified value with another value. In this case, it replaces all spaces (' ') with an empty string (''), effectively removing all whitespace.

Given the problem description to remove all whitespaces from a string, the function `func_1` correctly implements this behavior. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail as long as the input is a string. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for all possible valid inputs, and the correctness is **True**.
