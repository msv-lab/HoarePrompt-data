Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both accurately reflect the behavior of the `func_1` function. The function correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The provided test cases in the annotations demonstrate that the function works as intended for various inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
