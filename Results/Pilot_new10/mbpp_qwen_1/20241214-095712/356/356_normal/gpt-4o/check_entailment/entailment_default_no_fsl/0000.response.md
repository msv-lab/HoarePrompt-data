Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the input string `s`. The assertions in the code cover various cases including strings with leading spaces, trailing spaces, and multiple spaces between words. Since the function correctly removes all spaces in these cases and the problem description asks for removing all whitespaces (which includes spaces), the function appears to meet the requirements for the described cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
