Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the string. The assertions provided in the annotations correctly demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various test cases, including strings with leading and trailing spaces, and multiple consecutive spaces. Since the function removes all spaces and the provided test cases confirm this behavior, the program is correct.
