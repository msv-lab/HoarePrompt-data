Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` removes all whitespaces from a given string using the `replace` method. The assertions provided in the annotated program confirm that the function works as expected for various cases:

1. It correctly removes spaces from the middle of the string: `func_1('python  program') == 'pythonprogram'`.
2. It handles multiple consecutive spaces: `func_1('python   programming    language') == 'pythonprogramminglanguage'`.
3. It trims leading and trailing spaces: `func_1('python                     program') == 'pythonprogram'` and `func_1('   python                     program') == 'pythonprogram'`.

The `replace(' ', '')` method effectively removes all whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) from the input string, which aligns with the requirement to remove all whitespaces from a string. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
