Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a string as input and returns the same string with all whitespace characters removed. Since the problem description asks for a function to remove all whitespaces from a string, and the provided function correctly implements this functionality for valid string inputs, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
