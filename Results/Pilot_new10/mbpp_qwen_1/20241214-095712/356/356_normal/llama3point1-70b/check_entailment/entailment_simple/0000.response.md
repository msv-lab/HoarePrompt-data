Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `input_str` as input and uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the string. The `replace` method in Python replaces all occurrences of the specified value (in this case, a space ' ') with another value (an empty string ''). Therefore, the function effectively removes all whitespaces from the input string, meeting the requirement of the problem description. This solution works for all potential cases of input strings, including those with no spaces, single spaces, multiple consecutive spaces, and leading/trailing spaces.
