Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `input_str` as an argument and uses the `replace` method to remove all spaces from the string. The `replace(' ', '')` method call effectively removes all occurrences of whitespace characters (including spaces) from the input string. The function then returns the modified string without any spaces. This behavior exactly matches the problem description, which states that the function should remove all whitespaces from a string. Therefore, the program is correct.
