Let's break down the function `func_1(s, ch)` step by step to determine its functionality.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Parameters**:
   - `s`: A string.
   - `ch`: A single character string.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `first_index = s.find(ch)`: Finds the lowest index of `ch` in `s`.
   - `last_index = s.rfind(ch)`: Finds the highest index of `ch` in `s`.

3. **Conditions**:
   - If `first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1` or `first_index == last_index`, the function returns `s`.

4. **Else Condition**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns a substring of `s` excluding the characters at `first_index` and `last_index`.

### Detailed Summary

- **Case 1**: If `ch` is not found in `s` (i.e., `first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1`), the function returns the original string `s`.
- **Case 2**: If `ch` is found at multiple positions in `s` and the indices of the first and last occurrences are different (`first_index != last_index`), the function returns a new string where the characters at `first_index` and `last_index` are removed from `s`.

### Potential Edge Cases
- **No Occurrence of `ch`**: If `ch` is not found in `s`, the function correctly returns `s`.
- **Single Occurrence of `ch`**: If `ch` is found only once in `s`, the function also returns `s` because `first_index == last_index`.
- **Multiple Occurrences of `ch`**: If `ch` is found multiple times in `s` and the indices of the first and last occurrences are different, the function removes these characters and returns the modified string.

### Missing Logic
- The annotations mention the state of the program after the return statements and blocks, but they do not explicitly cover all edge cases. The actual code handles the cases where `ch` is not found and where it is found only once, ensuring the function behaves as expected in those scenarios.

### Functionality Summary

The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not found in `s` or if `ch` is found only once. If `ch` is found multiple times and the indices of the first and last occurrences are different, the function returns a substring of `s` with the characters at `first_index` and `last_index` removed.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not found or found only once. Otherwise, it returns a substring of `s` with the characters at the first and last occurrence of `ch` removed.**
