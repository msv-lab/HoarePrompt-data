Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the lowest index where `ch` is found in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`; `last_index` is the highest index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found. Either `first_index` is -1, `last_index` is -1, or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`.**
