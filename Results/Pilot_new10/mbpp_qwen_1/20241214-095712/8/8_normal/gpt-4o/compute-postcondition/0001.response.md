`last_index` is assigned the value of the highest index where `ch` is found in `s`. The `rfind` method returns the highest index of the substring `ch` if it is found in `s`, or -1 if it is not found. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the lowest index where `ch` is found in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`; `last_index` is the highest index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the lowest index where `ch` is found in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`; `last_index` is the highest index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found.**
