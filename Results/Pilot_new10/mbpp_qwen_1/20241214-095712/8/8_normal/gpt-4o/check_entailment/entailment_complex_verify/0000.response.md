Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string under all valid conditions. The annotations clearly show that the function behaves as expected in different scenarios, including edge cases where the character is not found or found only once. The provided test cases also confirm the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
