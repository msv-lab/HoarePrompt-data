Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the function `func_1` is correct based on the problem description. Upon closer inspection of the annotated version and additional edge cases, it becomes clear that the function does not correctly remove the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string in all scenarios. Specifically:

1. For the edge case "aaa" with 'a', the function returns 'a' instead of an empty string.
2. For "axbxcx" with 'x', the function returns "axbxc" instead of removing both the first and last 'x'.

These cases indicate that the function does not handle situations where the first and last indices of the character are the same or there is only one occurrence of the character, which contradicts the problem description. The function should return an empty string in such cases, not the original string or a modified string without removing the first and last occurrences. Therefore, the original assessment was not accurate.
