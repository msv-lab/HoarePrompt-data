Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the function `func_1` would remove the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string, even if they are the same. However, the annotated version shows that if the first and last indices of the character are the same, the function simply returns the original string. This means the function does not always remove both the first and last occurrences of the character, especially when they are the same. 

For example, in the case of `func_1('axbxcx', 'x')`, the expected output is `'axbc'` but the actual output is `'axbxcx'` because the first and last indices of 'x' are the same, and the function returns the original string. 

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirement of removing the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string in all cases, making the original assessment inaccurate.
