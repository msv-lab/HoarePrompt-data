Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where the first and last occurrences of the character are the same index. In such cases, the program should still remove the character at that index only once, but the current implementation removes it twice, effectively removing all instances of that character.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. When `first_occurrence` is equal to `last_occurrence`, the program currently uses `return s.replace(char, '', 1)` which removes only the first occurrence of the character, but then proceeds to the next part of the code that incorrectly attempts to remove the last occurrence again. Instead, it should simply remove the character at that index once.

2. The correct implementation should handle the case where `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence` by removing the character at that index only once, without the unnecessary additional operations.

To fix this, the code should be adjusted as follows:

```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    
    if first_occurrence == -1:
        return s  # If the character is not found, return the original string
    
    if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
        return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
```

With this corrected version, the program will correctly remove the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string, meeting the problem description for all potential cases.
