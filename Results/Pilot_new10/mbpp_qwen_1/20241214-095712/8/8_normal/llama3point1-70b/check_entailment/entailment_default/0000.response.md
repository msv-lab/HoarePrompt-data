Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The code uses `s.find(char)` to find the first occurrence and `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence of the character.
2. **Handling Single Occurrence**: If the character appears only once in the string, the code removes the single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
3. **Handling Multiple Occurrences**: If the character appears multiple times, the code constructs a new string by concatenating parts of the original string that exclude the first and last occurrences of the character.
4. **No Occurrence**: If the character does not appear in the string, the code simply returns the original string unchanged.

The code handles all the described scenarios and the output hints align with the provided code. There are no apparent edge cases or logical errors that would cause the function to fail according to the problem description.
