Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly handles all cases mentioned in the problem description:

1. If the character is not found in the string, the function returns the original string.
2. If the character is found only once, the function removes that single occurrence.
3. If the character is found multiple times, the function removes both the first and last occurrences.

The annotated version confirms that the logic inside the function aligns with the problem description and the original assessment. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
