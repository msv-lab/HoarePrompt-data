Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the logic of the program. The program correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of the given character and removes them as specified in the problem description. The original assessment is accurate because the program handles all described scenarios correctly, including edge cases where the character is not found in the string or where the first and last occurrences are the same.
