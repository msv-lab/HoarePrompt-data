The `find` method searches for the first occurrence of `char` in `s` and assigns the index of that occurrence to `first_occurrence`. If `char` is not found in `s`, `first_occurrence` will be `-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string and `char` is a single character string; `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`.**
