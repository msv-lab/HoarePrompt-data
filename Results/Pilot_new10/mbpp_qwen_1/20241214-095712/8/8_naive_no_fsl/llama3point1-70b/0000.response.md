Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string in all potential cases:

1. If the character is not found in the string, the function returns the original string.
2. If the character is found only once, the function removes that single occurrence.
3. If the character is found multiple times, the function removes both the first and last occurrences.

Let's consider some test cases:

- For `s = "hello"` and `char = "l"`, the function should return `"heo"`.
- For `s = "banana"` and `char = "a"`, the function should return `"banan"`.
- For `s = "test"` and `char = "x"`, the function should return `"test"` (since 'x' is not in the string).
- For `s = "level"` and `char = "e"`, the function should return `"lvle"`.

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected, thus the program is correct.
