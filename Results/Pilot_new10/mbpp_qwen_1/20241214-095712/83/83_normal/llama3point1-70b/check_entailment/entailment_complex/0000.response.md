Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements a function `func_1` that sorts a list of elements in descending order. The function iterates over the list from the full length down to a single element, finding the index of the maximum element in the current subarray and ensuring it moves to the end of the subarray. This process effectively builds the list in descending order through successive reversals. The function then returns the fully sorted list. This approach, while unconventional, achieves the goal of sorting the list in descending order as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given requirements.
