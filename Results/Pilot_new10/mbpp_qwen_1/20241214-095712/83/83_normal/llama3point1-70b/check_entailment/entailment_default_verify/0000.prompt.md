You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
    return arr


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly sort the list. The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the approach used to sort the list is not a standard sorting algorithm and may not produce the correct sorted order for certain inputs. For example, consider the input list `[3, 1, 2]`:

1. Initially, `size = 3`.
2. The maximum element is `3` at index `0`. The list is partially reversed to place `3` at the end: `[3, 2, 1]`.
3. Then `size = 2`.
4. The maximum element is `2` at index `1`. The list is partially reversed again: `[3, 1, 2]`.

The final state of the list is not sorted. A correct sorting algorithm would rearrange the elements so that the list is in ascending order. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement to sort the list correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and returns the list sorted in descending order. For each possible size from the length of `arr` down to 1, it finds the index of the maximum element in the current subarray. If the maximum element is not at the end of the current subarray, it reverses the prefix up to the maximum element's index and then reverses the entire current subarray. This ensures that the maximum element is moved to the end of the current subarray. After the loop completes, the function returns the fully sorted list in descending order. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
