Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and returns the list sorted in descending order. For each possible size from the length of `arr` down to 1, it finds the index of the maximum element in the current subarray. If the maximum element is not at the end of the current subarray, it reverses the prefix up to the maximum element's index and then reverses the entire current subarray. This ensures that the maximum element is moved to the end of the current subarray. After the loop completes, the function returns the fully sorted list in descending order.**
