Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements with the subarray `arr[:size]` reversed; `n` is greater than 0; `max_index` is the index of the new maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr` (denoted as `new_max_index`); if `new_max_index` is not equal to the size of `arr` minus one, the new maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr` remains unchanged from its original position. Otherwise, no further details are provided since there is no else part specified.***
