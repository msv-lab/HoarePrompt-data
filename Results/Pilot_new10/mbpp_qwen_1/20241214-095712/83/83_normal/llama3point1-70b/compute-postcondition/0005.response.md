The code reverses the sublist from the start of the array up to (and including) the index `max_index`. This means the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are reversed. The values of `n`, `max_index`, and the rest of the elements in `arr` beyond `max_index` remain unchanged.

Given that the initial state includes:
- `arr` is a list of elements
- `n` is greater than 0
- `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr`
- `max_index` is not equal to the size of `arr` minus one
- The current value of `max_index` is not 0

After executing the code, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed. The values of `n`, `max_index`, and the rest of the elements in `arr` beyond `max_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr`, `max_index` is not equal to the size of `arr` minus one, and the current value of `max_index` is not 0**
