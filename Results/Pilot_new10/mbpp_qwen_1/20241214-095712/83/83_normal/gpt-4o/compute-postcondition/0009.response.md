The code `max_index = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `max_index`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n ≤ len(arr), `max_index` is 3, and `i` is 3.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n ≤ len(arr), `max_index` is 3, and `i` is 3**
