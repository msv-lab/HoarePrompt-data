The code sets `max_index` to the value of `i`. From the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, `max_index` will be updated to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n \(\leq\) len(arr), `max_index` is 2, and `i` is 2.**
