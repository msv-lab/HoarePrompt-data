Postcondition: ***`max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `curr_size` elements of `arr`; `curr_size` is `curr_size_prev - 2`. If `max_index` is not equal to `curr_size - 1`, then both the element at `max_index` and the element at `curr_size - 3` have been flipped. If `max_index` is equal to `curr_size - 1`, no flipping operations are performed.***
