You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Annotated Functions:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements (can be of any comparable type).
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `curr_size` is 1, `max_index` is not defined (or can be any value since it's out of scope), `n` is the original length of `arr` and is now less than 2.
    return arr
    #`The program returns the sorted list 'arr' with its current size being 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` and sorts it in non-decreasing order using a specific swapping mechanism. If the array has fewer than 2 elements, it returns the array as is. After processing, the array is sorted, and its size is reduced to 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `arr` is a list of elements, and `end` is an integer such that 0 <= end < len(arr).
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements where the elements at indices `start` and `end` are swapped, `start` is equal to `end + 1`, `end` is equal to `-1`, and `start` must have been less than `end` initially.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `end` and reverses the sublist of `arr` from index 0 to `end` (inclusive). This is achieved by swapping elements at indices `start` and `end`, incrementing `start` and decrementing `end` until `start` becomes greater than or equal to `end`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of comparable elements, and n is an integer such that 0 < n <= len(arr).
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n â‰¤ len(arr), and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the subarray `arr[0:n]`.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum element in the subarray `arr[0:n]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` and an integer `n`, and returns the index of the maximum element in the subarray `arr[0:n]`. This is achieved by iterating through the subarray from index 1 to `n-1` and updating the index of the maximum element whenever a larger element is found.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
