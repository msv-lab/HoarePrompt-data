Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not implement a standard sorting algorithm. Instead, it appears to be attempting to sort the array by repeatedly finding the maximum element and swapping it to the end of the current subarray. However, this approach does not guarantee a fully sorted array. For example, consider the input `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`:

- Initially, `n = 5`.
- The first iteration sets `curr_size = 5`. It finds the maximum index (which is 1) and swaps it with the last element, resulting in `[1, 3, 2, 2, 1]`.
- The second iteration sets `curr_size = 4`. It finds the maximum index (which is 2) and swaps it with the last element, resulting in `[1, 3, 2, 1, 2]`.

This results in an array that is not sorted. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of sorting the list of elements for every potential case.
