Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly performs the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples and returns the result as a new tuple. The provided assertions also validate the correctness of the function based on the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate.
