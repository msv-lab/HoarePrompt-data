Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples and returns a new tuple with the results. The provided test cases in the assertions validate that the function behaves as expected. Since the annotated version aligns with the problem description and the function's implementation, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
