Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples of the same length and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements from the input tuples. The function uses a generator expression within a tuple to perform the bitwise AND operation for each pair of elements from the input tuples using `zip`.

The provided assertions check various scenarios, including different values and the edge case where the result of the bitwise AND operation is zero. Given the problem description and the provided assertions, the function appears to be correctly implemented and works as expected for the given examples and every potential case where the input tuples have the same length. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
