Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to extract the element-wise bitwise AND of the given two tuples `tup1` and `tup2`. Since the problem description asks to create a function that returns a tuple where each element is the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, the function does exactly this using a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over both tuples simultaneously, ensuring that each pair of corresponding elements is processed. The bitwise AND operation (`&`) is applied element-wise, and the results are collected into a new tuple. This approach works for any two tuples of the same length, meeting the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
