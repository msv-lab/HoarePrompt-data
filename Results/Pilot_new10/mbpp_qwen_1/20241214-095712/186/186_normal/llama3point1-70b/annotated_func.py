#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from tup1 and tup2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of the same length and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.
