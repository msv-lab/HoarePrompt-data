Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the bitwise AND (`&`) operation between elements of the two tuples. However, the problem description asks to extract elements from the tuples, which implies returning elements themselves rather than their bitwise AND results. The function returns a tuple of bitwise AND results, which does not match the problem description. For example, given the input tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the expected output should be a tuple containing the elements themselves, not their bitwise AND results. The correct implementation would simply return the tuples as they are, like so:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple1, tuple2
```

This would correctly extract the elements from the given tuples as per the problem description.
