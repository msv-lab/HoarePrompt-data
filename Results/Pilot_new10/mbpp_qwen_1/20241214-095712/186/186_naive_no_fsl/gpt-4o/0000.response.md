Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two tuples and returns the result as a new tuple. Based on the assertions provided:

1. For `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the function returns `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is correct because:
   - `10 & 5 = 0`
   - `4 & 2 = 0`
   - `6 & 3 = 2`
   - `9 & 3 = 1`

2. For `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, the function returns `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which is correct because:
   - `1 & 5 = 1`
   - `2 & 6 = 2`
   - `3 & 7 = 3`
   - `4 & 8 = 0`

3. For `(8, 9, 11, 12)` and `(7, 13, 14, 17)`, the function returns `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, which is correct because:
   - `8 & 7 = 0`
   - `9 & 13 = 9`
   - `11 & 14 = 10`
   - `12 & 17 = 0`

The function correctly implements the specified operation for the given test cases and there is no indication of missing logic or edge cases that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function appears to be correct according to the problem description.
