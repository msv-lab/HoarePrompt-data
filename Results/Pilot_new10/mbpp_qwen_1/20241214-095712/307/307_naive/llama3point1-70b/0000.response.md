Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is defined as the sum of the natural numbers up to a certain point, and the formula used in the program is correct: `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. The loop increments `idx` until the triangular number has `n` digits, which satisfies the problem description. There doesn't appear to be any edge cases or special conditions that this program fails to handle. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
