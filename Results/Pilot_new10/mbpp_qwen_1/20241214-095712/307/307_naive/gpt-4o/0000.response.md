Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The triangular number formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) is used iteratively until a triangular number with `n` digits is found. The loop increments `k` until the condition `len(str(triangular_number)) == n` is met, which ensures that the smallest triangular number with `n` digits is identified. The provided test cases also validate the functionality. Therefore, the program works correctly for the given problem description and potential cases.
