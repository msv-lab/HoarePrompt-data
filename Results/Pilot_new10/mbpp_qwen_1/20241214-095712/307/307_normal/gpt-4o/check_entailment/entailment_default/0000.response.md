Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(n)` aims to find the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is equal to `n`. The code iterates over values of `k` starting from 1 and checks if the length of the string representation of the corresponding triangular number matches `n`. Once it finds such a `k`, it returns it.

Given the assertions provided:
- For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, and \( k = 4 \) because \( 4 * (4 + 1) // 2 = 10 \).
- For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 105, and \( k = 14 \) because \( 14 * (14 + 1) // 2 = 105 \).
- For `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 4060, and \( k = 45 \) because \( 45 * (45 + 1) // 2 = 4060 \).

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the smallest `k` that satisfies the condition for each test case. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case, and Correctness: **True**.
