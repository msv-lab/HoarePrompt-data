Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The annotations clearly show that the function iterates, calculating triangular numbers until it finds one with the desired number of digits, and then returns the corresponding index `k`. The provided assertions also confirm the correctness of the function for the given test cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
