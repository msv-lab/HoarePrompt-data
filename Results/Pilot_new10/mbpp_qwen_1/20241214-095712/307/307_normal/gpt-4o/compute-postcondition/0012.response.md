Let's analyze the given while loop and the current state step by step.

The `while True:` loop means that the loop will continue indefinitely as long as no explicit break condition is encountered. This implies that we don't need to adjust any state to ensure the loop executes one more time because the loop will always run unless explicitly stopped.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is 3.
- `triangular_number` is 3.

Since the loop is `while True`, there is no condition to check for termination. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3**
