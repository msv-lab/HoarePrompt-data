Let's analyze the given annotated code step by step to determine the functionality of the function.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - The function starts with an integer `n` as a positive integer.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs indefinitely (`while True`).
   - Inside the loop, `k` is initialized to 1.
   - `triangular_number` is computed using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
   - The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is checked against `n`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - If the length of `triangular_number` equals `n`, the function returns `k`.
   - If the condition is not met, `k` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues.

4. **End of Loop**:
   - The loop continues until the condition `len(str(triangular_number)) == n` is satisfied.

5. **Return Statement**:
   - Once the condition is met, the function returns `k`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The code assumes that the loop will eventually find a `k` where the length of `triangular_number` matches `n`. However, there is no explicit check for termination if such a `k` does not exist within a reasonable range.
- The annotations mention that the function returns 1, 2, or 3, but the actual code does not explicitly limit the return values to these specific numbers. Instead, it returns the smallest `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals `n`.

### Summary of Functionality:
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and computes the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` equals `n`. It returns this integer `k`.

### Final Answer:
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is equal to `n`.**
