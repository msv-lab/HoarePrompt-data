Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1(n)` takes a single positive integer `n` as input.
2. **Initialization**: The variable `idx` is initialized to 1. This will be incremented in each iteration of the loop until the condition is met.
3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs indefinitely (`while True`) until the condition inside the loop is satisfied.
   - In each iteration, the current value of `idx` is used to compute the corresponding triangular number using the formula `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
   - The `if` condition checks whether the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`. 
     - If true, the function returns the current value of `idx`, which represents the smallest index satisfying the condition.
     - If false, `idx` is incremented by 1 and the process repeats.
4. **Final State**:
   - After the loop exits, the value of `idx` will be the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number with index `idx` is at least `n`.

The program follows these steps precisely and ensures that the returned value is the smallest index of a triangular number that has at least `n` digits. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
