Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. The loop continues incrementing `idx` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`. The annotations clearly indicate that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and there are no issues or edge cases identified that would render the program incorrect.
