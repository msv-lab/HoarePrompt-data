Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The formula used to calculate the triangular number (`idx * (idx + 1) // 2`) is correct, and the loop increments `idx` until the condition (length of the string representation of the triangular number being at least `n`) is met. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct index for the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. There are no edge cases or special conditions mentioned that this program fails to handle, so the original assessment is correct.
