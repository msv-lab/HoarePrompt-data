Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through natural numbers, calculates the corresponding triangular number, and returns the index once the length of the triangular number's string representation meets or exceeds `n`. Since the function handles all valid cases and returns the correct index, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
