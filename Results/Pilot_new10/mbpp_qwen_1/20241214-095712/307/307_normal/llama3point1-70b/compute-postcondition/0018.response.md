The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. Based on the value of `n`, the function returns one of the following: 

- Case_1: The function returns `idx` that is 1.
- Case_2: The function returns `idx` that is 2.
- Case_3: The function returns `idx` that is 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `idx` which is either 1, 2, or 3 based on certain conditions.
