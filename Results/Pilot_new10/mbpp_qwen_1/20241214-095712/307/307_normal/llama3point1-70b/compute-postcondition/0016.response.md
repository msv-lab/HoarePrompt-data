The code increments `idx` by 1. Given the initial state where `idx` is 3, after executing `idx += 1`, the value of `idx` will be 4. The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` (which is "6") is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, it could be any positive number, but the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` is not met because 1 is less than `n`. Therefore, the function does not return anything.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 4, and `triangular_num` is 6.**
