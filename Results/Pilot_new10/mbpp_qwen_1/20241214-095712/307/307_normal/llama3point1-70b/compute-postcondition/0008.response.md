`triangular_num` is updated to the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 2, we can calculate the new value of `triangular_num` as follows: `2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 2 * 3 // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
