Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring and then calculates the ending index. This approach covers all potential cases where the substring might or might not be present in the string. Since the function behaves as expected in all scenarios, it is correct.
