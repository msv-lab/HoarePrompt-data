Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the `find` method to locate the starting position of the substring within the main string. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`. If found, it calculates the end position and returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position. All the provided test cases correctly demonstrate that the function works as expected for both the presence and absence of the substring in the main string. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case mentioned in the problem description.
