The `find` method of the `main_string` object is called with `sub_string` as the argument. This method returns the lowest index in the string where the substring is found. If the substring is not found, it returns `-1`. The value of `main_string` and `sub_string` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`main_string` is a string and `sub_string` is a non-empty string; `start_pos` is either the lowest index where `sub_string` is found in `main_string` or `-1` if `sub_string` is not found.**
