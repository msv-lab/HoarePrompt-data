Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly handles both the presence and absence of the substring in the given string. When the substring is not found, the function returns `None`, which aligns with the problem description. When the substring is found, the function returns a tuple containing the starting index and the ending index (exclusive) of the substring, which also matches the requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
