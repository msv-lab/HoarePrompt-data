The code assigns the value of `start + len(substring)` to `end`. Since `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` and is not equal to -1, the value of `end` will be `start + len(substring)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` if it exists, otherwise -1; `start` is not equal to -1; `end` is `start + len(substring)`.

Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` if it exists, otherwise -1; `start` is not equal to -1; `end` is `start + len(substring)`**
