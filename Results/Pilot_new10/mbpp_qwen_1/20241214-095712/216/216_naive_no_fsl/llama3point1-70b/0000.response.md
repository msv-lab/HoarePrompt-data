Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. Here's how it works:

1. It first sorts the list.
2. It then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is exactly 1 using a generator expression inside the `all()` function.
3. Additionally, it ensures that all elements in the list are unique by comparing the length of the list with the length of a set created from the list.

This approach correctly identifies whether the list contains consecutive numbers, as it both ensures the numbers are in sequence and that there are no duplicates. Since the function covers all necessary conditions for the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, the program is correct.
