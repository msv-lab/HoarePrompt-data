Let's break down the function step by step:

1. **Parameter**: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of integers.
2. **Sorting**: The function sorts the list `lst` in ascending order.
3. **Check Conditions**:
   - The first condition checks if each element in the sorted list is exactly one greater than the previous element.
   - The second condition checks if all elements in the list are unique.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `True` only if both conditions are met: the list is consecutive and all elements are unique.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Analysis:
- The function first sorts the list, ensuring that any non-consecutive or non-unique elements are adjusted.
- After sorting, the function then checks if the sorted list is consecutive and contains unique elements.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- If the input list is empty, the function should still return `False` because there cannot be consecutive integers or unique elements in an empty list.
- If the input list contains duplicate elements before sorting, the function will still sort them, making them consecutive, but they will no longer be unique, thus returning `False`.

### Missing Logic:
- There are no missing functionalities in the provided code. However, it's worth noting that the function assumes the input is a list of integers. If the input is not a list or contains non-integer values, the behavior might be undefined or raise an exception.

### Functionality Summary:
Given the above analysis, the function checks if the input list `lst` is sorted in such a way that it forms a sequence where each element is exactly one greater than the previous element and all elements are unique. If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns True if the list is sorted and consecutive with all unique elements, otherwise it returns False.**
