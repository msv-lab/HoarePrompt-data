#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the list `lst` is consecutive (each element is exactly one greater than the previous) and all elements are unique, and False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns True if the list is sorted and consecutive with all unique elements, otherwise it returns False.
