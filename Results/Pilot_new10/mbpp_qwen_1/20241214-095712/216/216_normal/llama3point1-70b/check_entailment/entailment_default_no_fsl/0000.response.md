Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. It first sorts the list, ensuring that consecutive numbers will be adjacent. Then, it checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is exactly 1, which ensures they are consecutive. Additionally, it verifies that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list, ensuring all elements are unique. This covers all potential cases where the list should be checked for consecutive numbers and uniqueness. The function works correctly based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
