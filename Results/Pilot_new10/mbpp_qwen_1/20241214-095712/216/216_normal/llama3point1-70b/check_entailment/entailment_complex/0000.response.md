Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Sorting the List**: The line `lst.sort()` sorts the list in ascending order. This ensures that if the list contains consecutive numbers, they will appear in sequence after sorting.
2. **Checking Consecutive Numbers**: The line `return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` checks if each element in the sorted list is exactly one greater than the previous element. This ensures that the list contains consecutive numbers.
3. **Checking Unique Elements**: The line `and len(lst) == len(set(lst))` ensures that all elements in the list are unique by comparing the length of the list with the length of a set created from the list. Sets automatically remove duplicates, so if the lengths are equal, all elements are unique.

By combining these two conditions, the function correctly determines whether the list contains consecutive numbers with all unique elements. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description for every potential case.
