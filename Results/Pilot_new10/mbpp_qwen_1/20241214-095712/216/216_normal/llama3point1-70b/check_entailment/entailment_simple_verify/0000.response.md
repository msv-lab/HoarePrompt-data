Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the original problem description, the function `func_1` appears to be correctly implemented. The function sorts the list and then checks two conditions:
1. Each element is exactly one greater than the previous element.
2. All elements in the list are unique.

These conditions ensure that the list contains consecutive numbers. The original assessment is accurate because the provided function meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers, including those with duplicates that appear consecutively after sorting. There are no edge cases or scenarios identified in the annotations that would cause the function to fail, assuming valid input as specified.
