Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided function `func_1` appears to meet the requirements of checking for consecutive numbers with unique elements, the original assessment is not entirely accurate. The function first sorts the list, which changes its order. The problem description asks to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers without altering the original order of the list. Sorting the list before checking for consecutive numbers does not fulfill this requirement. Therefore, the function is not correct according to the problem description.
