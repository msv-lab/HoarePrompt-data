Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list and then checks if each element (starting from the second one) is exactly one greater than the previous element. Additionally, it ensures that all elements in the list are unique by comparing the length of the list to the length of a set of the list.

This approach works correctly for checking consecutive numbers with unique elements. The function will return `True` only if the list is both sorted and has consecutive numbers without any duplicates. 

For example:
- For the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function returns `True`.
- For the list `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, the function also returns `True`.

Even in cases where the list is not sorted or contains duplicates, the function handles them appropriately. Sorting the list ensures that the consecutive check is applied to the correct order, and checking the lengths against sets ensures no duplicates exist.

Since the code follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, the correctness is **True**.
