Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list and then ensures that each element is exactly one greater than the previous element. Additionally, it verifies that all elements in the list are unique. This approach effectively handles the problem requirements and the annotated version confirms the function's intended behavior. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned that the function would fail based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
