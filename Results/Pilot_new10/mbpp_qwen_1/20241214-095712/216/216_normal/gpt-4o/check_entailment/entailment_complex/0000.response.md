Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. Here's why:

1. **Empty List Check**: The function first checks if the list is empty (`if (not lst):`). If it is, the function returns `False`, as an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting and Comparison**: For non-empty lists, the function sorts the list (`lst_sorted = sorted(lst)`) and then iterates through the sorted list to check if each pair of consecutive elements differ by exactly 1. If any pair of consecutive elements does not satisfy this condition, the function immediately returns `False`.

3. **Return True for Consecutive Numbers**: If the function completes the iteration without finding any non-consecutive pairs, it returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

The provided test cases also validate different scenarios:
- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is a consecutive list, so it should return `True`.
- `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` is not a consecutive list, so it should return `False`.
- `[1, 2, 1]` is not a consecutive list because the sequence is not strictly increasing, so it should return `False`.

Since the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the provided assertions pass, the function is correct.
