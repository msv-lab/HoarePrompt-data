According to the given for loop, the loop will execute as long as there are at least two elements in `lst_sorted`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`, meaning that the loop can run if `lst_sorted` has more than one element.

Given that `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` and `lst` is not empty, we need to ensure that `lst_sorted` has at least two elements for the loop to execute properly.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Check the length of `lst_sorted`:**
   - For the loop to execute, `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements.
   
2. **Initial state of variables:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty.
   - `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`.

Based on these considerations, we need to adjust the state such that `lst_sorted` has at least two elements. Since `lst` is not empty and `lst_sorted` is its sorted version, we need to ensure that `lst_sorted` has at least two elements.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:
- `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` and must have at least 2 elements**
