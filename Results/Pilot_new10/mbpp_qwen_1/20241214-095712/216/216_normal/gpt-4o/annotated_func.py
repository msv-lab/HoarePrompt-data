#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: lst is a list of integers, and lst is not empty
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst_sorted` is a list of integers and is a sequence of consecutive integers, and the function does not return anything (returns None). If at any point the difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is not 1, the function returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns `True` if the list contains consecutive integers. If the list is empty or contains non-consecutive integers, it returns `False`.
