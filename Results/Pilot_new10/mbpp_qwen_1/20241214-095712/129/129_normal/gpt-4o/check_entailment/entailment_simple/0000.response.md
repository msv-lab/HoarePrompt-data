Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function that finds the ASCII value of a character. The function `func_1` takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function. The assertions in the program verify that `func_1('A')`, `func_1('R')`, and `func_1('S')` return the correct ASCII values (65, 82, and 83 respectively). Since the function behaves as expected for these test cases, and the logic aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.
