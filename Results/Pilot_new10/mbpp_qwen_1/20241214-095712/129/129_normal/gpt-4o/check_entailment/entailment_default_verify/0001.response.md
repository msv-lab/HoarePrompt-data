Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of a character. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a single character string and returns its ASCII numeric value, which aligns with the problem description of finding the ASCII value of a character. The assertions given in the test cases also pass, indicating that the function works correctly for the provided examples. Since the problem description does not mention any specific edge cases and the function handles the provided inputs correctly, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
