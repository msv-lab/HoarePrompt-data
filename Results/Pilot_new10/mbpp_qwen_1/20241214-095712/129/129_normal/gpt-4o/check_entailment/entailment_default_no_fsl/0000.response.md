Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the given character. The assertions in the code verify that `func_1('A')`, `func_1('R')`, and `func_1('S')` return the correct ASCII values (65, 82, and 83, respectively). Since the function behaves as expected for these test cases and the `ord()` function works correctly for any valid single character input, the program meets the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is True.
