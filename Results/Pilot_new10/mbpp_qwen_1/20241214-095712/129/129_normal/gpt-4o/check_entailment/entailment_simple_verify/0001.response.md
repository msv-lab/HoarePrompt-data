Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of a character. The assertions provided in the test cases (`assert func_1('A') == 65`, `assert func_1('R') == 82`, `assert func_1('S') == 83`) all pass, indicating that the function works as intended for the given examples. Since the `ord()` function is reliable for determining ASCII values and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that would cause this function to fail, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
