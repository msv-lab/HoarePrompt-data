Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the ASCII value of a character. The function takes a single character string `char` as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. This matches the problem description exactly, which states that the function should return the ASCII value of a given character. The function will work for any single character input, fulfilling the requirement for all possible cases.
