Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. This exactly fulfills the requirement to "find the ascii value of a character." The function signature and documentation also correctly reflect this behavior. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases where the input is a single character string.
