Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. The problem description asks for a function that finds the ASCII value of a character, which is exactly what this code does. There are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the output hints or elsewhere that would cause this function to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
