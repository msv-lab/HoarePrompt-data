Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of the given character using the built-in `ord()` function. The provided test cases assert that the function returns the correct ASCII values for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. Since the function works as expected for these test cases and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail, we can conclude that the program is correct according to the problem description.
