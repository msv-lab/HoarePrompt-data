Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string for all potential cases. It splits the input string by underscores and capitalizes each resulting word, then joins them together without spaces. This logic will work for any valid snake case string, including those with multiple consecutive underscores (which would be handled as empty strings and thus not appear in the final result), leading underscores, or trailing underscores. Since the function handles all these cases correctly, it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential input.
