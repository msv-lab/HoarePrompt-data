Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string as per the problem description. Here's a breakdown:

1. The function `func_1` takes a single argument `snake_str`, which is expected to be a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores.
2. It splits the input string at each underscore (`_`) using `snake_str.split('_')`. This results in a list of substrings.
3. Each substring in the list is then capitalized using a generator expression `x.capitalize()` for each `x` in `components`.
4. Finally, these capitalized substrings are joined together into a single string without any separators using `''.join()`.

The provided test cases:
- `assert func_1('python_program') == 'PythonProgram'`
- `assert func_1('python_language') == 'PythonLanguage'`
- `assert func_1('programming_language') == 'ProgrammingLanguage'`

all demonstrate that the function works correctly for snake case strings with multiple words and no special characters other than underscores. Since the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
