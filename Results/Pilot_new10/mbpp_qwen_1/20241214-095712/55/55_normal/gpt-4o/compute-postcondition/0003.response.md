Let's analyze the provided annotated code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `snake_str`, which is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores.
2. Inside the function, `snake_str` is split into components using the underscore `_` as the delimiter.
3. Each component is then capitalized using the `capitalize()` method.
4. Finally, these capitalized components are joined together without any separators using the `join()` method and returned.

Given the annotations and the code, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `snake_str` containing only lowercase letters and underscores, splits the string into components based on underscores, capitalizes each component, and returns a new string with these capitalized components joined together without any separators.**
