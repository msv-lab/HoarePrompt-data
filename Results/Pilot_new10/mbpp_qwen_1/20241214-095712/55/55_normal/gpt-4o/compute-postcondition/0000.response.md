The `split` method splits the `snake_str` string at each underscore and returns a list of the substrings. Each substring in the resulting list is a part of the original string separated by underscores. The `snake_str` variable itself does not change, but a new variable `components` is created which holds the list of these substrings.

Output State: **`snake_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores; `components` is a list of substrings from `snake_str` split at each underscore.**
