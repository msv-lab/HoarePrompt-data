The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `snake_str`. `snake_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores. The function returns a string where each substring in 'components' (which are the parts separated by underscores) is capitalized and joined together without any separators.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `snake_str` and return a new string with each component (part separated by underscores) capitalized and joined together.
