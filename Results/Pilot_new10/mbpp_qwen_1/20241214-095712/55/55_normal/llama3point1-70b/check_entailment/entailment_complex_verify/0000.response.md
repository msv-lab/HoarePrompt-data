Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the analysis confirm that the function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It handles various edge cases such as empty strings, strings with only underscores, and strings without underscores. The original assessment correctly states that the function is correct based on the problem description.
