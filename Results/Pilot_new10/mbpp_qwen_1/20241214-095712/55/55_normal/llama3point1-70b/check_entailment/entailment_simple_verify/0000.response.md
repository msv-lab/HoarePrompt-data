Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the step-by-step analysis confirm that the function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. The function handles various edge cases such as an empty string, a string containing only underscores, and a string with no underscores appropriately. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
