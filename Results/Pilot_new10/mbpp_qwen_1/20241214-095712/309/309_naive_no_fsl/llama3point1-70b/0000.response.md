Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This logic is correct and will work for all potential cases. A set contains only unique elements, so if all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain only one element, and the condition `len(set(s)) == 1` will be true. If there is even one different character, the set will contain more than one element, and the condition will be false. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for all possible inputs.
