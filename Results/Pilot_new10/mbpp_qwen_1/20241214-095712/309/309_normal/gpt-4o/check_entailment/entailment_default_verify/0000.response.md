Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in a string are the same. The function handles the empty string case by returning `True`, which is correct since an empty string trivially has all characters the same. The function iterates through each character in the string and compares it to the first character. If any character is different, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all characters. The provided test cases confirm its correctness. The output hints also align with the functionality of the function, indicating that it accepts a non-empty string and returns `True` if all characters are the same, otherwise `False`. There are no issues with the provided code based on the problem description and the given test cases.
