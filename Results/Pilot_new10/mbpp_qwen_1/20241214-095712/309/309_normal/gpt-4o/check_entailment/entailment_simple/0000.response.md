Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem description asks for a function that checks whether all the characters in a string are the same. However, the current implementation of `func_1` incorrectly returns `True` when the input string is empty.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Empty String Handling**: The current implementation checks if the string is empty using `if (not s):` and immediately returns `True`. An empty string should return `False` because there are no characters in it to compare, meaning they trivially cannot all be the same.

2. **Logic Flow**: After the initial check for an empty string, the function proceeds to iterate over the string and compare each character with the first character. If any character differs, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. This logic is correct but the handling of the empty string case is incorrect.

To fix this, the function should return `False` for an empty string:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if not s:
        return False
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
    return True
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle all cases as per the problem description.
