Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks if all characters in a string are the same. The annotations support this by showing that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. The original assessment is accurate because the function handles the empty string case by returning `True`, and it iterates through the string to compare each character with the first one, correctly returning `False` if any character differs. The test cases provided also confirm the function's correctness.
