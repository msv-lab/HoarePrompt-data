Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`. If every character in `s` is equal to `first_char`, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: `s` is a non-empty string, and `first_char` is the first character of `s`.
- **Loop Code**: The loop iterates over each character in `s`. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function immediately returns `False`.

- **After the Loop Executes Some Number of Times**:
  - After the first iteration (`char` is the first character): No change in `s` and `first_char`.
  - After the second iteration (`char` is the second character): If the second character is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns `False`.
  - After the third iteration (`char` is the third character): If the third character is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns `False`.

From these observations, we can conclude that if the loop completes without returning `False`, it means that every character in `s` is equal to `first_char`. Therefore, the function will return `True` if all characters match `first_char`.

Thus, the final output state is that if every character in `s` is equal to `first_char`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
