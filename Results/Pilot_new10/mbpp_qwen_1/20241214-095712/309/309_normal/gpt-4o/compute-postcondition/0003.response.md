The code assigns the first character of the string `s` to the variable `first_char`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` will be the character at index 0 of `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `first_char` is the first character of `s`.**
