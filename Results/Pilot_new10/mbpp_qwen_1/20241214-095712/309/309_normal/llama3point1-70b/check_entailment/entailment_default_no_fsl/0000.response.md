Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly checks if all characters in the string `s` are identical by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This approach works for all potential cases, including empty strings (though the problem description specifies a non-empty string, the function still handles this gracefully by returning `False`), strings with all identical characters, and strings with at least one different character. The function meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
