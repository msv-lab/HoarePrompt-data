Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both confirm that the function `func_1` correctly checks if any word in the input string contains the letter 'z' (excluding the first and last characters). The function splits the input string into words, iterates over each word, and checks the specified condition. If the condition is met for any word, the function returns `True`. If no word meets the condition after checking all words, the function returns `False`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, and the annotated version confirms the correctness of the function's behavior.
