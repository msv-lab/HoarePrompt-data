Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks each word in the input string `s` to see if it contains the character 'z' in positions other than the first and last character. The function splits the input string into words and iterates over them, checking the condition for each word. If any word satisfies the condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This matches the problem description exactly, and there are no obvious edge cases or examples where the function would fail to meet the requirements.
