Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check if a string contains the letter 'z', but not at the start or end of any word in the string.
2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` splits the input string `s` into a list of words using `split()`.
   - It then iterates over each word in the list.
   - For each word, it checks if the word's length is greater than 1 and if the character 'z' appears in the substring formed by excluding the first and last characters (`word[1:-1]`).
   - If such a word is found, the function immediately returns `True`.
   - If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`.

The program accurately implements the requirement to check for 'z' within the middle of any word, ensuring that 'z' is not at the start or end of the word. Thus, the program meets the problem description in all cases.
