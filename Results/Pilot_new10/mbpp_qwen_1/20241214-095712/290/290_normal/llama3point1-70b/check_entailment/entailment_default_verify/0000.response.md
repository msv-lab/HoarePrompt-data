Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to check if a string contains the letter 'z' in the middle of each word, excluding the first and last characters of the word. The output hints also correctly describe the functionality of the function. There is no indication in the problem description or the code that the function does not meet its intended purpose for any potential cases. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
