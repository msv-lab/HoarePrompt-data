Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple()` constructor to perform the subtraction element-wise, which ensures that the operation is applied to each pair of elements from the two input tuples.

Given the assertions provided:
1. `(10, 4, 5) - (2, 5, 18) = (8, -1, -13)`
2. `(11, 2, 3) - (24, 45, 16) = (-13, -43, -13)`
3. `(7, 18, 9) - (10, 11, 12) = (-3, 7, -3)`

The function passes all these tests and handles tuples of different lengths correctly by using `zip`, which will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple. Since no other edge cases or potential errors were identified, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.
