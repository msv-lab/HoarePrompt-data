Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the corresponding elements of the second tuple from the first tuple. This is verified by the use of a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor, which iterates over the zipped pairs of elements from both tuples and performs the subtraction. Since the function behaves as expected for all tested cases and the operation described in the problem statement is accurately implemented, the function is correct.
