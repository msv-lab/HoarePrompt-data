Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple using the `zip` function. The function returns a tuple containing the results of these subtractions. Based on the assertions provided:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18))` returns `(8, -1, -13)`, which is correct.
2. `func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16))` returns `(-13, -43, -13)`, which is correct.
3. `func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12))` returns `(-3, 7, -3)`, which is correct.

The function handles tuples of different lengths appropriately by stopping the subtraction when the shorter tuple ends. Since no edge cases or incorrect behavior has been identified, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.
