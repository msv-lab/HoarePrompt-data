The function `func_1` accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of the same length, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. This operation is performed using a generator expression within a tuple comprehension. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code correctly performs the subtraction for all valid inputs.
