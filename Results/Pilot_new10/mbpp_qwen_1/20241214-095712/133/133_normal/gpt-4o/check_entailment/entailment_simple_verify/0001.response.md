Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple with each element being the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of the second tuple from the first tuple. The provided assertions pass, confirming that the function works as intended for the given problem description. The annotated code aligns with the original assessment, and there are no issues or errors identified in the program under the assumption of valid input.
