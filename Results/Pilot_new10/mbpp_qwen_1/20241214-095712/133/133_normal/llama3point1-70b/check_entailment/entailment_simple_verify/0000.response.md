Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the corresponding elements of the second tuple from the first tuple. The annotation confirms that the function returns a tuple where each element is the result of the subtraction. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
