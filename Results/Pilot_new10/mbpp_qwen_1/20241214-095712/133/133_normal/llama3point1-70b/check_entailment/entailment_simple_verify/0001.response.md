Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function works as intended, given that the input tuples are of the same length and contain numerical values. The original assessment is accurate because the function handles the case where tuples are of different lengths by using `zip`, which implicitly raises a `ValueError` if the tuples are not of the same length, which is the expected behavior for such operations in Python. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
