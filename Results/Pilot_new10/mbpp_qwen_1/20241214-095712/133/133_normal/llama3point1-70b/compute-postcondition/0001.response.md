The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numerical values. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of the same length, and return a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `tup1` and `tup2`, returns a tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`.**
