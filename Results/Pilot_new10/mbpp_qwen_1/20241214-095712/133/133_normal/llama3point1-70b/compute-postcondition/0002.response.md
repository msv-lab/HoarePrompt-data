The annotated code indicates that the function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, of the same length, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The annotations suggest that the function performs this operation for all elements in the tuples.

Given the code and the annotations, the function correctly subtracts corresponding elements of `tup2` from `tup1` and returns the resulting tuple. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need to be explicitly handled differently within the function itself. 

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of the same length, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`.**
