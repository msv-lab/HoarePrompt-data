Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` ensures that for each element, it checks all previous elements to see if they can form a valid subset with the current element. This approach handles the divisibility condition effectively.

Given the test cases:
- For `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]`, the output is `4`, which is correct as the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.
- For `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]`, the output is `3`, which is correct as the largest subset is `[5, 10, 20]`.
- For `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]`, the output is `4`, which is correct as the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.

Since the provided code handles these cases correctly and the logic appears sound for the described problem, the program is correct. There do not appear to be any edge cases or inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the problem description.
