Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of elements in the subset is divisible. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Base Case Handling**: 
   - If the input list `nums` is empty, the function correctly returns `0`. This handles the base case where no elements are present in the list.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting helps in easily checking divisibility conditions between pairs of elements.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - A dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with all values set to `1`. Each `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset ending at `nums[i]` where every element in the subset divides the next element.
   - The nested loops iterate through the list to update the `dp` array based on the divisibility condition. For each element `nums[i]`, the code checks all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`). If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which gives the size of the largest subset satisfying the divisibility condition.

The provided program meets all the requirements of the problem description. It correctly sorts the list and uses a dynamic programming approach to ensure that every pair in the selected subset is divisible. Therefore, the program is correct.
