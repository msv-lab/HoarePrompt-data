According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1`. The key condition for updating `dp[i]` is that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is that `i` is a positive integer and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, leading to `dp[i]` being updated to the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **Value of `i`:** Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration (implied by the range `range(i)`), the new value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.
2. **Condition for `nums[i]` being divisible by `nums[j]`:** This condition will apply to the new value of `i` in subsequent iterations.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.
- The condition `nums[i]` must be divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j < i` will hold true.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

State: **`i` is a positive integer plus 1, and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j < i`**
