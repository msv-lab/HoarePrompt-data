According to the given for loop, the loop variable `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are:

- `i` is greater than 0
- `j` is 0
- `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`
- `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[0] + 1)`

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to increment from 0 to 1 (if `i` is 2 or greater), or the condition `i > 0` must still hold true.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `i` is greater than 0
   - `j` is 0
   - `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`
   - `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[0] + 1)`

2. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i > 0`.
   - For `j` to move to the next value, `j` must be incremented to 1 (assuming `i` is 2 or more).

Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop will increment `j` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` is still greater than 0
- `j` is now 1
- `nums[i]` remains the same and is still divisible by `nums[j]`
- `dp[i]` remains the same and is still updated to `max(dp[i], dp[0] + 1)`

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[0] + 1)`**
