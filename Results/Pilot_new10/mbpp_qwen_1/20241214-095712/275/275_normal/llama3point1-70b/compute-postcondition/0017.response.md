Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State
- `nums` is a list of positive integers, and `nums` is not empty, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.
- `i` is 1.
- `i` is less than `len(nums)`.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(1, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis

1. **Initialization**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - At the start of the first iteration, `i = 1`.

2. **First Iteration (i = 1)**
   - The loop runs through the range `range(1, len(nums))`, so `j` will iterate over `[0]`.
   - For each `j` in the range, the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

3. **Second Iteration (i = 2)**
   - Now, `i` is incremented to 2.
   - The loop runs through the range `range(2, len(nums))`, so `j` will iterate over `[0, 1]`.
   - For each `j` in the range, the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

4. **General Iteration (i = k)**
   - For each `i` from `1` to `len(nums) - 1`, the loop runs through the range `range(i)`.
   - For each `j` in the range, the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

5. **Final State Before Next Iteration**
   - At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than `len(nums)`.

### Final Output State Before Next Iteration
- `i` will be incremented from `1` to `len(nums) - 1`.
- The loop will terminate when `i` equals `len(nums)`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- Since `i` will be incremented from `1` to `len(nums) - 1`, the next iteration will start with `i = len(nums)`.

### Adjusted State
- `nums` remains a list of positive integers, and `nums` is not empty, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is updated according to the conditions inside the loop.
- `i` will be `len(nums)` at the start of the next iteration, meaning the loop will terminate.

**State at the start of the next iteration:**
- `nums` is a list of positive integers, and `nums` is not empty, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where each element `dp[k]` (for `k` from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`) is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `nums[k]` such that each element in the subsequence divides the next element.
- `i` is `len(nums)`.

**Output State:**
State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers, and `nums` is not empty, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order. `dp` is a list where each element `dp[k]` (for `k` from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`) is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `nums[k]` such that each element in the subsequence divides the next element. `i` is `len(nums)`**.
