`dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given the initial state where `dp` is a list where each element is initially set to 1 (except `dp[1]` which is 2), `i` is 1, and `j` is 1, the value of `dp[1]` will be updated from 2 to the maximum of 2 and `dp[1] + 1`, which is `2` and `1 + 1 = 2`. Since they are equal, `dp[1]` remains 2. No other changes occur to the values of `nums`, `dp`, `i`, or `j`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element is initially set to 1 except `dp[1]` which is 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1, and `dp[1]` is 2.**
