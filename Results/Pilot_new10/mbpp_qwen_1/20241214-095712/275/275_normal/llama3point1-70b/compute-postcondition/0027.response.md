Postcondition: ***`i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` (or may change), and `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[2] + 1)` if the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` is true. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged when the condition is false.***
