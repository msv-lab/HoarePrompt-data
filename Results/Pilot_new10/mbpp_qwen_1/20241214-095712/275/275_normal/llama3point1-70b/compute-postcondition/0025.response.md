Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
   - `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[1] + 1)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`.

3. **Determine the new state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented.
   - Since `j` was initially 1, it will now be 2 (if the loop executes again).

4. **Check the constraints for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < i`.
   - Since `i` is greater than 0, `j = 2` will still satisfy this condition if `i` is at least 2.

5. **Update the relevant states:**
   - `i` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.
   - `j` is now 2.
   - `nums[i]` and its divisibility condition with `nums[j]` will be checked again.
   - The value of `dp[i]` may change based on the loop body, but we don't know the exact new value without the loop body.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` (or may change), and `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[1] + 1)` (or may change)**.
