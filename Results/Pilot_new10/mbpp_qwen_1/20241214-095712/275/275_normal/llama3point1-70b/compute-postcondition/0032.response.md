The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This means that `dp[i]` will take the larger value between its current value and the value of `dp[j]` plus one. The conditions given are that `i` is greater than 0 and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. These conditions remain true after the code execution.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0; `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`; `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`**
