Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `i` is a non-negative integer ranging from 1 to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - `j` is an integer ranging from 0 to `i - 1`.
   - `nums[i]` is an integer in the list `nums`.
   - `nums[j]` is an integer in the list `nums` such that `j < i`.
   - `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `i` where each element divides the next element.

2. **For Loop Analysis**:
   - The for loop iterates over `j` ranging from 0 to `i - 1`.
   - This means the loop will only execute if there are values of `j` within the specified range.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one value of `j` in the range from 0 to `i - 1`.
   - This implies that `i` must be greater than 0 because if `i` were 0 or negative, there would be no valid values for `j`.

4. **Final State**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is at least 1, as `j` ranges from 0 to `i - 1`.
   - The other variables (`j`, `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `dp[i]`) do not directly affect the loop execution condition but should remain consistent with their initial definitions.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`i` must be greater than 0**.
