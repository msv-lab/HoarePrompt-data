According to the given information, the loop variable `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is a positive integer plus 1, and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j < i`. After executing the if-else block, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for some `j < i`.

To determine the state needed for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `i`.
2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a positive integer plus 1, meaning the current value of `i` is 2 (since it's a positive integer plus 1).
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to reach `i-1`, which means `j` will be incremented from its previous value to `i-1`.

Since `i` starts at 2, the loop will execute for `j` values from 0 to 1 (i.e., `j` will go through 0 and 1).

For the next iteration, `i` will remain 2, but `j` will increase from 1 to 1 (the maximum value `j` can take before the loop exits).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` remains a positive integer plus 1 (which is 2), and `nums[i]` is still divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j < i` (which holds true since `j` was within the range of 0 to 1).

State: **`i` is a positive integer plus 1, and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j < i`**
