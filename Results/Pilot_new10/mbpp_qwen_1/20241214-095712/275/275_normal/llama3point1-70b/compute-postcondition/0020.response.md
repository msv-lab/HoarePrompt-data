The code updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given the initial state, where `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, the output state will be:

- `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[0] + 1)`.
- The states of `i`, `j`, `nums[i]`, and `nums[j]` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[0] + 1)`**.
