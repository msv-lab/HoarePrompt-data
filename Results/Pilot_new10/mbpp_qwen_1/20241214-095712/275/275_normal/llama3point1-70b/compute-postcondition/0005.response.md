State before the loop starts: `nums` is a list of positive integers, and `nums` is not empty, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The for loop runs from `1` to `len(nums) - 1`. This means the loop starts with `i = 1`.
2. For the loop to start, `i` must be at least `1`, and the condition `i < len(nums)` must be true initially.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that:
- `i` is set to `1`.
- `i` is less than `len(nums)`.

Here is the modified state:
State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers, and `nums` is not empty, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` is 1, and `i` is less than `len(nums)`**
