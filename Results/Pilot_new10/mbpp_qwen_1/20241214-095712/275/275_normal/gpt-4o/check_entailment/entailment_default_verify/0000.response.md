Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible. The output hints accurately summarize the functionality of the `func_1` function. The program handles the case where the input list is empty by returning 0, and it uses dynamic programming to find the longest subsequence where each element divides the next element. The provided test cases confirm the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
