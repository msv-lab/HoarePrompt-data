According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is within the range of `len(nums)`. Given that `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order and `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, these states are already correct for the loop to potentially execute. However, we need to ensure that `i` starts from 0 and goes up to but does not exceed `len(nums) - 1`.

So, the initial state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start and execute properly.

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` is 0**
