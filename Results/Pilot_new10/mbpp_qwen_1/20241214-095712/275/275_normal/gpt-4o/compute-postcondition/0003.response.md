The `sort()` method sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the elements in the list, we can represent the output state generally, but it will reflect that the list is now sorted.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers and it is sorted in ascending order**
