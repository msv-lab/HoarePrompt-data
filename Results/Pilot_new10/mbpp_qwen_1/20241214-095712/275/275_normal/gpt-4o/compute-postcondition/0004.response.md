The code initializes a list `dp` with length equal to the length of `nums`, where every element in `dp` is set to 1. This does not affect the values of `nums` itself.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers and it is sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.**
