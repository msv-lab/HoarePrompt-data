Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1` (with `j` being the index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`). After the execution of the if-else block, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
