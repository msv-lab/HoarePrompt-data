The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, it means `nums[j]` divides `nums[i]` without remainder, and `dp[j]` is a value from the previous calculations.

Given the initial conditions:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.
- `i` must be greater than 0.
- There exists a `j` such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

After executing the line `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`, the value of `dp[i]` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `dp` initially contains ones, the minimum value of `dp[i]` before this operation is 1. However, since `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, the condition `dp[j] + 1` will always be at least 2 (if `dp[j]` is 1). Therefore, `dp[i]` will be updated to at least 2.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1` (with `j` being the index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`), `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` exists such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.**
