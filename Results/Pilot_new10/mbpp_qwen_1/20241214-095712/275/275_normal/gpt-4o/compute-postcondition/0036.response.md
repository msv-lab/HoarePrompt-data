Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `dp[j] + 1` for some index `j`, where `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. Since there is no else part, this condition fully describes the postcondition after the if-else block executes.***
