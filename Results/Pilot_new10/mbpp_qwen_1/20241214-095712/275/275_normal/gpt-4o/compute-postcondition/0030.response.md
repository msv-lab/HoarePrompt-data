Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop variable is `j`, and it ranges from `0` to `i-1`.
   - The loop condition `j < i` must be true for the loop to execute.

2. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element.
   - `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, meaning `i` is the length of the `nums` list.

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `i`. Since `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, the loop will run for `j` values from `0` to `len(nums)-1`.

4. **Formulate the Final State**:
   - `nums` remains a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` remains as defined, but no additional adjustments are needed for `dp` itself since the loop body is omitted.
   - `i` is set to `len(nums)`.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments to the states are:

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element, and `i` is equal to `len(nums)`**
