Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` retains its original value.***
