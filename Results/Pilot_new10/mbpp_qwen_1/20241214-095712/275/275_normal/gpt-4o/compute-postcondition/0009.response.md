Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1` (with `j` being the index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`), `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` exists such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. If no such `j` exists, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
