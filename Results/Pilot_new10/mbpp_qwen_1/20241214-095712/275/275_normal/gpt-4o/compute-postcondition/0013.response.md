According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1` (inclusive). The loop body involves updating the `dp` list based on the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1` (with `j` being the index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`).
- After the execution of the if-else block, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

1. **Index `i`**: The loop starts with `j = 0` and goes up to `i-1`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
2. **State of `dp`**: The `dp` list will remain the same as it is updated inside the loop for each `j` but only affects `dp[i]` if the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` is met.

Given that the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`, the next value of `i` will be `i+1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `nums` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `dp` remains the same as it is updated based on the current `i` and does not affect future iterations until the next `i` is considered.

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1` (with `j` being the index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`), and `i` is increased by 1**.

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1` (with `j` being the index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`), and `i` is 1 more than the previous `i`**.
