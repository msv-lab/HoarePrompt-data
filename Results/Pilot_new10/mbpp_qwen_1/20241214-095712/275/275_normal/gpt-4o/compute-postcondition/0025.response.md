Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element.
   - `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - `dp[len(nums) - 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < len(nums) - 1` if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. Otherwise, `dp[len(nums) - 1]` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Context:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

3. **Objective:**
   - We need to determine the state adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is currently `len(nums) - 1`, the loop `for j in range(i)` will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = len(nums) - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must increase by 1 until it reaches `len(nums) - 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `len(nums) - 1`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `nums` remains unchanged as the list itself does not change during the loop.
   - `dp` remains unchanged because the update happens only when `i` is the last index, and now `j` is increasing towards the last index.
   - `i` remains `len(nums) - 1` since it is not modified within the loop.
   - The loop condition `for j in range(i)` will now check the range `range(len(nums) - 1)`, meaning `j` will go from `0` to `len(nums) - 2`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `j` is now `len(nums) - 1`.

The final state is:
State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element; `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`; `j` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`.**
