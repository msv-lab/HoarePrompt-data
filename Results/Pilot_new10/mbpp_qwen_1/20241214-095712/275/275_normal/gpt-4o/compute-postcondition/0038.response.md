The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. However, without knowing the exact values of `i`, `j`, and the contents of `dp`, we can only describe the general impact on the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
- `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

The variable `dp` is being updated, but its initial state is not specified. We know that `dp[i]` is being set to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

Since the exact values of `dp`, `i`, and `j` are not given, we can't provide specific values for `dp[i]`. However, we can say that `dp[i]` is now the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order; `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `dp[i]` is the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
