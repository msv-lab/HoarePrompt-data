According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i`, where `i` is the current index being considered. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, and `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` is updated based on the condition that `dp[i]` is the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j` where `j < i` and `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **Current Value of `i`**: Since the loop is iterating over the range from 0 to `i`, at the end of the last iteration, `i` would be the current index of the last element processed. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

2. **Updated States of `nums` and `dp`**: The state of `nums` remains unchanged because it is an input list and does not change during the loop. The state of `dp` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop. However, since the exact values of `dp` depend on the loop body, we cannot provide specific values without knowing the loop body. We only know that the loop updates `dp` based on the given condition.

Given these points, we can summarize the required adjustments as follows:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `nums` remains unchanged.
- The state of `dp` is updated but we cannot provide specific values without the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is incremented by 1, and `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` is updated based on the given condition.**
