Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element.
- `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, meaning `i` is the length of the `nums` list.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < i`. Since `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, the loop will run from `j = 0` to `j < len(nums)`.
2. **Variable `j`**: This is the loop variable that takes values from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

### State to Adjust:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `i` is a valid integer representing the length of `nums`. Since `i` is already set to `len(nums)`, no adjustment is needed for `i`.

However, we need to ensure that `j` starts from `0` and iterates up to `len(nums) - 1` correctly within the loop. 

Given that `nums` and `dp` remain unchanged, there are no additional constraints or adjustments needed for these variables.

### Final State:
Since `i` is already set to `len(nums)` and the loop will run correctly as long as `i` is a valid integer, no further adjustments are necessary for `nums` or `dp`.

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`**.
