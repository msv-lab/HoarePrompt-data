Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` only appends uppercase characters to the result string. According to the problem description, it should remove lowercase substrings entirely, not just filter out lowercase characters. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the function will return "HW", but it should return an empty string since the entire string consists of lowercase characters. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
