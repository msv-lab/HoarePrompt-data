Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not remove all lowercase substrings from the given string as required by the problem description. Instead, it only removes lowercase letters, leaving uppercase letters and other characters unchanged. The output hints confirm that the function only retains uppercase characters and returns an empty string if no uppercase characters are found, which aligns with the original assessment and not the problem description. For instance, the input `'aBcDe'` should result in an empty string, but the program returns `'BCD'`, indicating it does not fully meet the requirements.
