Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` removes lowercase substrings from a given string by keeping only the uppercase characters. However, the problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings entirely, not just individual characters. 

For example, consider the input string `'helloWORLD'`. The expected output would be `'WORLD'` because the entire lowercase substring `'hello'` needs to be removed. But the current implementation would keep the uppercase `'WORLD'` and ignore the lowercase part, which does not meet the requirement. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this specific case.
