`result` is assigned the value of `result` concatenated with `char`. The initial segment of `s` that has been processed is still the same, meaning the part of `s` up to the character just added to `result` remains unchanged. The only change is that `result` now includes the latest character.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least two characters, `result` is a concatenation of all uppercase characters from the initial segment of `s` that has been processed plus the latest character (`char`).**
