State before the loop starts: `s` is a string, `result` is ''

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character. The initial value of `result` is an empty string and does not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the string `s` has at least one character.

State: **`s` is a string that must have at least one character, `result` is ''**
