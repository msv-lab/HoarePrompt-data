Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` only retains uppercase characters and discards all other characters, including lowercase ones. This behavior does not align with the problem description, which requires removing lowercase substrings (i.e., sequences of lowercase characters). The function as implemented only removes individual lowercase characters, not entire substrings. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be revised to correctly implement the required functionality.
