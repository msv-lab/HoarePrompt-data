You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the given string. According to the problem description, the function should remove all lowercase characters, but the current implementation only removes lowercase characters that are standalone and not part of substrings. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program will return "HW" instead of the expected "HelloWorld" since it does not consider substrings containing uppercase letters. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `result` is a concatenation of all uppercase characters from the string `s`.
    return result
    #The program returns the concatenation of all uppercase characters from string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing all the uppercase characters from `s`. This is achieved by iterating through each character in `s`, checking if it is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and appending it to the `result` string if it is. The function handles all characters in the input string, including edge cases where the string is empty or contains no uppercase characters.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
