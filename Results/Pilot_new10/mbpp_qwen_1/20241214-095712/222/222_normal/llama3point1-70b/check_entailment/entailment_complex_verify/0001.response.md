Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version clearly shows that the function `func_1` only appends uppercase characters to the result string and discards all other characters, including lowercase ones. However, according to the problem description, the function should remove lowercase substrings entirely. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the function does not meet the requirement of removing lowercase substrings as specified in the problem description.
