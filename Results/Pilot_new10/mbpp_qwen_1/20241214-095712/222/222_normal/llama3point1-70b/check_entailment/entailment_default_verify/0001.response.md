Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not remove lowercase substrings as described in the problem statement. Instead, it filters out lowercase characters and keeps uppercase characters. The output hints correctly describe this behavior, which means the function does not meet the requirement to remove lowercase substrings entirely. Therefore, the original assessment should remain as False.
