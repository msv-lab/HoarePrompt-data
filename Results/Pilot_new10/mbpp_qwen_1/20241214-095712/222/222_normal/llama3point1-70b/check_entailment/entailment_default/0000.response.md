Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code removes lowercase substrings from a given string by keeping only the uppercase characters. However, the problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings entirely, not just individual lowercase characters. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the expected output would be an empty string since it contains lowercase substrings. The current implementation does not remove the entire lowercase substrings, leading to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
