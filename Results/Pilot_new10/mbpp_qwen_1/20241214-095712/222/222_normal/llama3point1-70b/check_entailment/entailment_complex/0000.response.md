Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the program actually constructs a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string. 

Hereâ€™s why it is incorrect:

- The problem description requires removing lowercase substrings (i.e., any substring that contains at least one lowercase letter).
- The program instead retains only the uppercase characters and discards all other characters (including uppercase letters without lowercase letters).

For example, consider the input string `"HelloWorld"`. The program will output `"HW"` because it retains only the uppercase characters. However, according to the problem description, the output should be an empty string `""` since the entire string contains lowercase substrings.

To correctly implement the function, you would need to iterate through the string and either retain or discard each character based on whether it is part of a lowercase substring. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    in_lowercase_substring = False
    
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char.islower():
            in_lowercase_substring = True
        elif not in_lowercase_substring and char.isupper():
            result += char
        elif in_lowercase_substring and char.isupper():
            in_lowercase_substring = False
    
    # State of the program after the for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `result` is a concatenation of all characters that are not part of a lowercase substring.
    return result
    # The program returns the concatenation of all characters that are not part of any lowercase substring from string 's'
```

This corrected program properly removes lowercase substrings as required by the problem description.
