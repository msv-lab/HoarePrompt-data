Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string using the built-in `count` method. All the provided test cases work as expected, and since the function behaves correctly for these cases, and there are no obvious edge cases that the function fails to handle (such as overlapping occurrences or empty strings), we can conclude that the function is correct.
