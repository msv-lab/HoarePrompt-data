Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string using the built-in `count` method. The output hints also confirm that the function accepts a string and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std'. Since the function handles all the provided test cases correctly and the `count` method correctly accounts for overlapping substrings, there is no indication that the program does not meet the problem description.
