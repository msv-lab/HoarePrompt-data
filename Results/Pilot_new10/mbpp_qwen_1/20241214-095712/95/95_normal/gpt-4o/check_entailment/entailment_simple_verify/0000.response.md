Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with each other. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `count` method to find the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string. The provided assertions pass, and the function handles both non-empty and empty strings correctly. There are no issues with the code based on the problem description and the annotations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
