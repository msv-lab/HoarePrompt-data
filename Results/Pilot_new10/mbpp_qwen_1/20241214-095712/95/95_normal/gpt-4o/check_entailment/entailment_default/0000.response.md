Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. The function uses the built-in `count` method of strings, which is designed to count the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring within a string. All the provided test cases correctly demonstrate that the function works as expected:

- `func_1('letstdlenstdporstd')` returns `3`.
- `func_1('truststdsolensporsd')` returns `1`.
- `func_1('makestdsostdworthit')` returns `2`.
- `func_1('stds')` returns `1`.
- `func_1('')` returns `0`.

Since the function handles all the provided test cases correctly and the problem description asks for counting the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string, the function meets the requirements for every potential case mentioned.
