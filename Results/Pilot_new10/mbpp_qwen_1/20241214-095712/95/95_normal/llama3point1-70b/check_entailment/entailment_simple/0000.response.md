Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' within `s`. This directly matches the requirement stated in the problem description, which asks to write a function to count the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string. The use of the `.count()` method in Python is an appropriate and efficient way to achieve this, ensuring the function works correctly for any input string `s`.
