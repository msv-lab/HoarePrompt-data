Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the number of times the substring 'std' appears in the input string. Since the function works correctly for all potential cases (including edge cases such as empty strings), the original assessment is accurate.
