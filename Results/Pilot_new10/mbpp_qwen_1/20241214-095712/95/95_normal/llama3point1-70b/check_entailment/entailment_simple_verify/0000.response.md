Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. The annotation clearly states that the program returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the string `s`, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
