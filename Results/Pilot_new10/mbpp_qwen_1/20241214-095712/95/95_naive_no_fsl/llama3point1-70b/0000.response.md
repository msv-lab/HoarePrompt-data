Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s` using the built-in `count` method. This method handles all potential cases, including overlapping occurrences. Since the function works as expected for all potential cases described in the problem, the correctness is True.
