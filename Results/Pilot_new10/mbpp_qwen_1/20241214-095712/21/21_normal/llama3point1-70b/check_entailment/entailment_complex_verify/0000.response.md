Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in the list `nums`. The annotated version confirms that `nums` is a list of integers, which is the expected input for the `min` function. Since the input is assumed to be valid, the function will work as intended to find and return the smallest number in the list. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
