Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. Given the problem description to find the smallest number in a list, the code correctly implements this functionality. The `min()` function works for any list of integers, including edge cases such as an empty list (where it would raise a `ValueError`), negative numbers, and duplicate smallest values. Since the problem does not specify handling an empty list or any other specific edge cases, the code meets the basic requirements for finding the smallest number in a list. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
