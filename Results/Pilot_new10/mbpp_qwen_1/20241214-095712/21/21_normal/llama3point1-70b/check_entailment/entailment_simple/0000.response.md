Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function takes a list of integers as input and returns the smallest number in the list using the built-in `min()` function. Since the problem description asks for a function to find the smallest number in a list, and the function `func_1` correctly implements this functionality, it satisfies the problem description for all potential cases.
