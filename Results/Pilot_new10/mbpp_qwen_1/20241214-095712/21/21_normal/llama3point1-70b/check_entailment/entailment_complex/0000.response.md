Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns the minimum value from the list using the built-in `min()` function. Since the problem description asks for a function that finds the smallest number in a list of integers, and the function `func_1` achieves this accurately for any list of integers, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
