Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses Python's built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list. This approach works correctly for all the test cases provided and for the general case of finding the smallest number in a list of integers. The output hints also confirm that the function should handle all possible cases, including an empty list (which would raise a `ValueError`) and a list with a single element. Since the problem does not explicitly state that the function should handle an empty list, and since the built-in `min()` function raises an error when called on an empty list, the function can be considered correct for the given test cases and the implicit assumption that the input list is non-empty.
