Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns the minimum value using Python's built-in `min()` function. The provided assertions pass for the given test cases, and the function handles the provided examples correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
