Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list. The problem description asks for a function to find the smallest number in a list, and the program meets this requirement. The provided assertions cover different scenarios, including lists with multiple elements, lists with a single element, and implicitly handle an empty list since the `min()` function would raise a `ValueError` for an empty list. However, the problem description does not explicitly mention handling an empty list, but the function should raise an appropriate error or handle it gracefully. Despite this, the program works correctly for the given examples and the general case, thus it can be considered correct.
