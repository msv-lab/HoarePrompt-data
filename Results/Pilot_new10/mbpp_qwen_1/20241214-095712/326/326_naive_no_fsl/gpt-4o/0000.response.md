Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0 as there would be no difference to calculate. It then sorts the array and iterates through the sorted array to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the smallest possible difference is found. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function passes them, indicating that it works correctly for the described problem. There doesn't seem to be any edge case that the code is missing based on the given examples and the general logic of the function.
