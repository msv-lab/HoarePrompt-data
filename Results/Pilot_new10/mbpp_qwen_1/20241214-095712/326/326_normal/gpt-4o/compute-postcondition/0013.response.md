Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `min_diff` is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list. If `diff` (which is `arr[2] - arr[1]`) is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `min_diff` is set to `diff`.***
