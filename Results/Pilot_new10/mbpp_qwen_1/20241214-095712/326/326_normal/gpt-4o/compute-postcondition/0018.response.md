Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list, `i` is `n-2`, and `diff` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n-2]`. If the loop executes, `min_diff` is the minimum difference found during the loop. Otherwise, `min_diff` remains `float('inf')` if the loop does not execute.**
