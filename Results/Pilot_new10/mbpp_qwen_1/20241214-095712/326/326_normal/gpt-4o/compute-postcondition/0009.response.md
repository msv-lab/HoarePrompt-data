Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list, `i` is 0, and `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`. If `diff < min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`. Otherwise, `min_diff` remains unchanged.***
