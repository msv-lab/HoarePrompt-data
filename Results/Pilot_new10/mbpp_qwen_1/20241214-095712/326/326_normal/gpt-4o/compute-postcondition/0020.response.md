The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is the length of the list and satisfies the condition that `n >= 2`. 

- In Case_1, the function returns 0.
- In Case_2, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and its length `n`, and return either 0 or the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`.
