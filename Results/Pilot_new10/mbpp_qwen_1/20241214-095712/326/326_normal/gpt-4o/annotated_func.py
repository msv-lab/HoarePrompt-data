#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and n is the length of the list such that n >= 2.
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: arr is a list of integers, and n is the length of the list such that n is greater than or equal to 2
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list, `i` is `n-2`, and `diff` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n-2]`. If the loop executes, `min_diff` is the minimum difference found during the loop. Otherwise, `min_diff` remains `float('inf')` if the loop does not execute.
    return min_diff
    #`The program returns min_diff which is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list 'arr'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n`, where `n` is the length of `arr` and `n >= 2`. It first checks if `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in that case. Otherwise, it sorts the list `arr`, then iterates through the list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. Finally, it returns this smallest difference.
