Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function handles the edge case where the length of the array `n` is less than 2 by returning 0. It sorts the array and then iterates through it to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function passes them. The output hints also align with the implementation details of the function, confirming that the original assessment is accurate.
