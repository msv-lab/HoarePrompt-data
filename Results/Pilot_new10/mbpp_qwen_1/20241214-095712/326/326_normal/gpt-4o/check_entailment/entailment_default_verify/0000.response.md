Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function first checks if the length of the array `n` is less than 2 and returns 0 in that case. Otherwise, it sorts the array and iterates through the elements to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements. The examples provided in the original assessment also confirm that the function works as expected. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
