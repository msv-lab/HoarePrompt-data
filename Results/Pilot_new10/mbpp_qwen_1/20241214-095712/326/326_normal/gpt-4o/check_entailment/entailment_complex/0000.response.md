Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
2. **Functionality of the Program**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (a list of integers) and `n` (the length of the list).
   - It first checks if `n` is less than 2. If so, it returns 0, as there are no pairs of elements to compare.
   - If `n` is 2 or more, it sorts the list `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements.
   - Finally, it returns this smallest difference.

The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description:
- It handles the edge case where `n < 2` by returning 0.
- It sorts the array to ensure the minimum difference is found between consecutive elements.
- It iterates through the sorted array to compute the differences and keeps track of the smallest difference found.

Since the program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array, it adheres to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
