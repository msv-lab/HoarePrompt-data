Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first checks if the array has fewer than 2 elements and returns 0 in that case. For arrays with at least 2 elements, it sorts the array and iterates through adjacent elements to find the smallest difference. The provided assertions also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
