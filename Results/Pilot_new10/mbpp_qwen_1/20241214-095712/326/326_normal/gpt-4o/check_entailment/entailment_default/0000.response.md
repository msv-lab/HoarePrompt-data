Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n`, where `n` is the length of `arr` and `n >= 2`. It first checks if `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in that case. Otherwise, it sorts the list `arr`, then iterates through the list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. Finally, it returns this smallest difference. The provided assertions confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Since the code handles all cases correctly and the output hints match the code's behavior, the function should work for every potential case.
