Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly states that the function `func_1` takes two parameters, `arr` and `target`, when in fact it only takes one parameter, `arr`. The function does not use the `target` parameter at all, which makes the original assessment inaccurate. Based on the problem description, the function should only take an array of integers and return the minimum difference between any two elements in that array. The provided code correctly implements this functionality without the unused `target` parameter.
