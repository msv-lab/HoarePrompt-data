Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not match the problem description because it does not actually use the `target` parameter, which was mentioned in the problem description. The function should ignore the `target` parameter and only find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. Since the `target` parameter is unused, the code is incorrect according to the problem description.
