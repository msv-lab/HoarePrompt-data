Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given Python function `func_1(arr, target)` aims to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Let's break down the function and see how it meets the requirements specified in the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The function takes an array `arr` (a list of integers) and a `target` (which is unused in the function but might be a placeholder for future use). The function does not explicitly validate the input type or size, but it assumes `arr` is a non-empty list of integers.

2. **Sorting the Array**: 
   ```python
   arr = sorted(arr)
   ```
   Sorting the array ensures that all elements are in ascending order. This step is crucial because finding the minimum difference between any two elements becomes straightforward when the array is sorted. The smallest difference will always be between two consecutive elements.

3. **Finding Minimum Difference**:
   ```python
   min_diff = float('inf')
   for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
       diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
       
       if diff < min_diff:
           min_diff = diff
   ```
   - Initialize `min_diff` to infinity (`float('inf')`).
   - Iterate through the sorted array and calculate the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive elements.
   - Update `min_diff` if the current difference is smaller than the previously recorded minimum difference.

4. **Return Statement**:
   ```python
   return min_diff
   ```
   The function returns the smallest difference found during the iteration.

Given this analysis, the function correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. It sorts the array first and then iterates through it to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements, which inherently covers all possible pairs in the array. Therefore, the function satisfies the problem description, and the correctness is **True**.
