The code assigns the current value of `diff` to `min_diff`. Since `diff` is defined as `abs(arr[len(arr) - 2] - arr[len(arr) - 1])`, `min_diff` will now also hold this value. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `diff` is `abs(arr[len(arr) - 2] - arr[len(arr) - 1])`, `min_diff` is `abs(arr[len(arr) - 2] - arr[len(arr) - 1])`**
