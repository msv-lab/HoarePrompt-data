The code calculates the absolute difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the next element `arr[i + 1]` in the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers, the value of `diff` will be the absolute difference between these two consecutive elements. However, the code does not assign this value to any variable or perform any operation with it. It simply computes the difference.

Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The only new information is that `diff` holds the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements; `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`**
