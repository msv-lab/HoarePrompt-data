According to the given for loop, the loop variable `i` starts from `len(arr) - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches a value less than `len(arr) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decreased by 1 and become `len(arr) - 2`. The values of `arr` and `min_diff` remain unchanged as the loop body is omitted and there is no modification to these variables within the loop.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `diff` is `abs(arr[len(arr) - 1] - arr[len(arr) - 2])`, `min_diff` remains unchanged.**
