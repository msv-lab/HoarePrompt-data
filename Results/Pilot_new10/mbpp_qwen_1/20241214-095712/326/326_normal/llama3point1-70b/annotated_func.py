#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)

    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in `arr`.
    return min_diff
    #`The program returns min_diff which is the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list 'arr'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, sorts the list `arr`, and returns the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr`.
