Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function first checks if the array has fewer than 2 elements, in which case it returns 0 as specified. It then sorts the array and iterates through adjacent elements to find the smallest difference. The examples provided also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Since the function handles the sorting and comparison logic correctly and all the provided examples work as expected, the program is correct for the given problem description.
