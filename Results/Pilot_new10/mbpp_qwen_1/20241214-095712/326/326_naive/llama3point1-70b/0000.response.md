Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The program first sorts the array, which ensures that the smallest differences will be adjacent. It then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements and keeping track of the minimum difference found. This approach guarantees that the minimum difference is found for all possible pairs of elements in the array. Since the program handles all potential cases correctly, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
