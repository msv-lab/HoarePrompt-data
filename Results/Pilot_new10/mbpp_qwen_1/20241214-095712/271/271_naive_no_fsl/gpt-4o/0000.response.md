Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position. The function iterates over the first tuple to determine the number of elements and then collects the elements at each position across all tuples. It calculates the average of these collected elements and appends the result to the `averages` list. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for the provided test cases and should handle any potential case where the input is a tuple of tuples with numeric values. Since no edge cases or specific scenarios are identified where the function fails, the program is correct.
