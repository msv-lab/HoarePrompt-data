The code initializes an empty list named `averages`. No operations are performed on the existing variables `tuples` and `num_elements`. Therefore, the `tuples` list remains unchanged, and `num_elements` retains its original value.

Output State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numeric values (integers or floats); `num_elements` is the number of elements in the first tuple of `tuples`; `averages` is an empty list.**
