The code calculates the average of the `elements_at_position` list. The value of `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`. However, the actual values of `elements_at_position` and `tuples` are not specified. The variable `i` and the content of `tuples` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`elements_at_position` is a list created by extracting the element at index `i` from each tuple in the list `tuples`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`, `tuples` and `i` retain their original values.**
