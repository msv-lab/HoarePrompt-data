The code calculates the average of the elements in `elements_at_position` and assigns it to the variable `avg`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact values in `elements_at_position` or the length of `tuples`. Therefore, we can only say that `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the number of elements in `elements_at_position`.

Output State: **`num_elements` must be greater than 0; `elements_at_position` is a list of elements extracted from the tuples at index `i`; `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `elements_at_position`.**
