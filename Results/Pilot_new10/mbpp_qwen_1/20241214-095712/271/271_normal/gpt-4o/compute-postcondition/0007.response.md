The given Python code creates a new list `elements_at_position` using a list comprehension that extracts elements from each tuple in the list `tuples` at index `i`. However, the initial values of `tuples` and `i` are not specified in the initial state. 

Since the initial values of `tuples` and `i` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `elements_at_position`. But we can describe the structure and the relationship between the variables.

Output State: **`elements_at_position` is a list created by extracting the element at index `i` from each tuple in the list `tuples`; `tuples` and `i` retain their original values.**
