The code `num_elements = len(tuples[0])` calculates the length of the first tuple in the list `tuples` and assigns it to the variable `num_elements`. This operation does not affect any other variables. 

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numeric values (integers or floats); `num_elements` is the number of elements in the first tuple of `tuples`.**
