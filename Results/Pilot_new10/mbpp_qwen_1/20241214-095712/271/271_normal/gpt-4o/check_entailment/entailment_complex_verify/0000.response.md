Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the values at that position from all tuples, calculates their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The provided test cases correctly demonstrate the functionality of the function, and the annotations confirm that the function handles the input as expected. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.
