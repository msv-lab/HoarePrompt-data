Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position. The annotations confirm that the function iterates over the first tuple to determine the number of elements, collects the elements at each position across all tuples, calculates the average of these elements, and appends the result to the `averages` list. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for the provided test cases and should handle any valid input as per the given assumptions. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
