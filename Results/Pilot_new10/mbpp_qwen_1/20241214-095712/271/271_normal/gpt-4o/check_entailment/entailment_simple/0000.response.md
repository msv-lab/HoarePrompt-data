Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a single argument `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing numeric values. This matches the requirement that the input should be a tuple of tuples.

2. **Averaging Logic**: 
   - The function calculates the number of elements in the first tuple using `num_elements = len(tuples[0])`. This ensures that the number of elements to be averaged is consistent across all tuples.
   - A nested list comprehension `[t[i] for t in tuples]` is used to extract the elements at the current index `i` from each tuple within `tuples`.
   - The average is computed as `avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, which correctly calculates the average of the values at each position across all tuples.
   - These average values are appended to the `averages` list, ensuring that the final output is a list of averages for each position.

3. **Output**: After the loop completes, the function returns the `averages` list, which contains the average values of the elements at each position across all tuples.

### Test Cases Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: `((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))`
  - Expected Output: `[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]`
  - Actual Output: `[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]`
  - The output matches the expected result, confirming the correctness of the implementation.

- **Test Case 2**: 
  - Input: `((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))`
  - Expected Output: `[25.5, -18.0, 3.75]`
  - Actual Output: `[25.5, -18.0, 3.75]`
  - The output matches the expected result, confirming the correctness of the implementation.

- **Test Case 3**: 
  - Input: `((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40))`
  - Expected Output: `[305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]`
  - Actual Output: `[305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]`
  - The output matches the expected result, confirming the correctness of the implementation.

Since the program meets the problem description in all cases tested, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
