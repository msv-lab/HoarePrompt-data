Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the values at that position from all tuples, calculates their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The provided test cases demonstrate the functionality of the function, and the annotations support this correctness. Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem description.
