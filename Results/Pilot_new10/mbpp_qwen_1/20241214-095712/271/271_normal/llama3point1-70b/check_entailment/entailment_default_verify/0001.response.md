Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function is correct, but upon reviewing the provided code and problem description, it appears that the function does not handle cases where the input list of tuples is empty. According to the problem description, the function should calculate the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. However, the provided code uses `len(tuples)` in the denominator, which would result in a `ZeroDivisionError` if the input list is empty. The output hints mention that the function returns an empty list if the input list is empty, which is a reasonable behavior, but this behavior is not explicitly stated in the original explanation. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate because it does not account for the potential error in handling an empty input list.
