Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding elements across all tuples in the input list. The annotation correctly states that the function returns a list of averages and that it works as expected given valid input. Since the problem description specifies that the input is a list of tuples with the same length and the function handles this case correctly, the original assessment is accurate.
