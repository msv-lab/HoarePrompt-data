Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The annotation describes that the program returns a list of values, where each value is the average of the corresponding elements across all tuples in the list `tuples`. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
