Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the functionality of the provided program. The function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding elements across all tuples in the input list of tuples. The annotation correctly describes the behavior of the function, including the expected input and output. Since the original assessment concluded that the program is correct and the annotated version confirms this understanding, the original assessment remains accurate.
