Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over corresponding elements from each tuple. It then calculates the sum of these values and divides by the number of tuples to get the average. This approach works for any list of tuples containing numerical values, including edge cases like an empty list of tuples, which results in an empty list as per the problem description and output hints. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
