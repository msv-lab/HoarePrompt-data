Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(deg)` correctly converts an angle from degrees to radians. According to the problem description, the task is to write a function that converts degrees to radians. The function takes a single parameter `deg`, which can be a float or an integer representing degrees, and returns the equivalent value in radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \frac{\pi \times \text{degrees}}{180} \). This matches the mathematical definition of converting degrees to radians, and the function correctly implements this conversion. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
