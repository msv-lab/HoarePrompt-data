Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the degree value by \(\pi/180\). The annotations confirm that the function accepts a float or integer representing degrees and returns the equivalent value in radians. Since the function accurately implements the required conversion formula and the problem description matches the implementation, the original assessment is accurate.
