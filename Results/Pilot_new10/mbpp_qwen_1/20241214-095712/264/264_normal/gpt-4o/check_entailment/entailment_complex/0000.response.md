Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians according to the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a floating-point or integer parameter `degrees`, which represents an angle in degrees, and returns the equivalent angle in radians by multiplying `degrees` by π/180. This conversion formula is accurate and consistent with the mathematical definition of converting degrees to radians. The assertions provided also validate that the function works correctly for the given test cases (90°, 60°, and 120°), further confirming its correctness.
