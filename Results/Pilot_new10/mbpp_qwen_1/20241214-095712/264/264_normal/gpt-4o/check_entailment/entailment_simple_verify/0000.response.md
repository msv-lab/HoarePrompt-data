Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The provided assertions also validate the correctness of the function. Since the annotations align with the function's implementation and the assertions pass, the original assessment is accurate.
