Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input degrees by `math.pi / 180`. The given test cases (90, 60, and 120 degrees) match the expected outputs (1.5707963267948966, 1.0471975511965976, and 2.0943951023931953 respectively), which are accurate conversions using the mathematical constant Ï€. Since the function adheres to the problem description and the provided test cases confirm its correctness, no other potential cases were found where the program fails.
