Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function `func_1` passes the given assertions, and there is no apparent logic error or edge case that would cause it to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
