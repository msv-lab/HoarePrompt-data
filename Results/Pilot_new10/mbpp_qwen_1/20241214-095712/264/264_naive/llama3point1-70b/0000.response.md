Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula is accurate and the function implements it correctly. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the function works correctly for all potential cases.
