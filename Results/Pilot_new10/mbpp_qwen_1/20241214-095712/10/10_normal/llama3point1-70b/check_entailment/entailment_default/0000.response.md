Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The function accepts three positive float parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, and returns the calculated volume using the formula \(b \times h / 2 \times l\).

Given the problem description and the output hints, the function appears to be correct for every potential case as long as the inputs are valid (i.e., positive floats). There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
