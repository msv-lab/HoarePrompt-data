Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, which represent the base length of the triangular face, the height of the triangular face, and the length of the prism, respectively. These parameters are all positive floats. The function calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\), which is correctly implemented as `b * h / 2 * l`. This formula is mathematically equivalent to the standard volume formula for a triangular prism. Therefore, the program is correct as it performs the required calculation accurately for any valid input values.
