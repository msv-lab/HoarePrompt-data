Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(b, h, l)` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The provided output hints confirm that the function handles the expected inputs (`b`, `h`, and `l` as positive floats) and performs the calculation as intended. There are no edge cases mentioned in the output hints that suggest the function is incorrect, and the problem description aligns with the implemented formula.
