Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly states that the function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\), which matches the problem description. Given the assumptions that the inputs are valid positive floats, the function correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
