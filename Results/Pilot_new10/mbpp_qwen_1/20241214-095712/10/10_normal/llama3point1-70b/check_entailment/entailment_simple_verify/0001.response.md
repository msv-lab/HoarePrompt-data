Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1(b, h, l)` correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). Given that the inputs \(b\), \(h\), and \(l\) are all positive floats representing the base length, height of the triangular face, and length of the prism respectively, the function will compute the volume accurately as per the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
