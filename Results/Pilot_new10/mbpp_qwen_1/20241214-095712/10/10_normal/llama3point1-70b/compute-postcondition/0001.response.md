The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`. `b` is a positive float representing the base length of the triangular face, `h` is a positive float representing the height of the triangular face, and `l` is a positive float representing the length of the prism. After executing the function body, the function returns the value of `(b * h / 2 * l)`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three positive floats `b`, `h`, and `l`, and return the calculated volume of a triangular prism using the formula `(b * h / 2 * l)`.
