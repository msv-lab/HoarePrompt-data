Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. The provided test cases pass, and the output hints confirm that the function handles the expected inputs correctly. Since the problem description and the function's implementation align with the provided test cases and output hints, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
