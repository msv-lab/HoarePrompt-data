Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\), which is correct according to the problem description. The function takes three parameters: `b` (the base of the triangle), `h` (the height of the triangle), and `l` (the length of the prism). Since the formula used in the function matches the formula for the volume of a triangular prism, and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
