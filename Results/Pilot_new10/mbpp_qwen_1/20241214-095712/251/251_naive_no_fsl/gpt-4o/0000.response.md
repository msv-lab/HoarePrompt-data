Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). The radius `r` is calculated using the formula `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` and the angle `θ` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which handles the correct quadrant for the angle. The provided test cases also match the expected results:

1. For (3, 4), the radius `r` is 5.0 and the angle `θ` is approximately 0.927 radians.
2. For (4, 7), the radius `r` is approximately 8.062 and the angle `θ` is approximately 1.052 radians.
3. For (15, 17), the radius `r` is approximately 22.672 and the angle `θ` is approximately 0.848 radians.

Since the function works correctly for these cases and `math.atan2` handles the correct quadrant, the function appears to be correct for the general case. There are no apparent edge cases or issues that would make this function incorrect based on the provided information.
