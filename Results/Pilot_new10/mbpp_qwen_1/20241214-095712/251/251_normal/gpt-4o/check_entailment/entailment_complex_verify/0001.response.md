Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The radius `r` is calculated as the Euclidean distance using the formula \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), and the angle `Î¸` is calculated correctly using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which accounts for the correct quadrant. The provided test cases also match the expected results, and the annotated version aligns with the function's intended behavior. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
