Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align with each other. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates by calculating the radius \( r \) as \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the angle \( \theta \) using `math.atan2(y, x)`. The provided assertions validate the correctness of these calculations. Since the function passes all the test cases and the formulas used are mathematically sound, the original assessment is accurate.
