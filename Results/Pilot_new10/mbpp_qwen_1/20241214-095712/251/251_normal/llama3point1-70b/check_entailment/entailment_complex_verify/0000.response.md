Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†). The annotations confirm that `r` is calculated as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y) using `math.hypot(x, y)`, and `phi` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point (x, y) using `math.atan2(y, x)`. Since the function correctly implements the required conversion for all valid inputs (x, y), the original assessment is accurate.
