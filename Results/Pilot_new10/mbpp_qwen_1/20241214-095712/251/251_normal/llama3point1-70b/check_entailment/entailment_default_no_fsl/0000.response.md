Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, phi)`. Here, `r` is calculated using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which computes the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`, and `phi` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which gives the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point `(x, y)`. This function handles all potential cases, including negative values for `x` and `y`, as `math.atan2` correctly accounts for the quadrant of the point. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
