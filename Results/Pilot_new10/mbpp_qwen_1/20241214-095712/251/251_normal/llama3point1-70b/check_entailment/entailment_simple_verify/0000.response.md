Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†). The annotations clearly show that `r` is calculated as the Euclidean distance from the origin, which is represented by the formula \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), and `phi` is calculated as the angle from the positive x-axis, which is correctly handled by `math.atan2(y, x)`. The original assessment is accurate because the function correctly implements the required conversion for all valid inputs (x, y).
