Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). The `math.hypot(x, y)` function calculates the radius `r` as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y), and `math.atan2(y, x)` calculates the angle `φ`. The function handles the edge case (0, 0) appropriately, where `r` is 0 and `φ` is 0. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs, and there are no indications that the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
