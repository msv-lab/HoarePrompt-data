Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, representing rectangular coordinates. It returns the values `r` and `phi`, where `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`, and `phi` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point `(x, y)`.**

This summary covers all the functionality described by the code and annotations, including handling potential edge cases such as when `x` or `y` are zero, ensuring that the returned values are correctly calculated using `math.hypot` for `r` and `math.atan2` for `phi`.
