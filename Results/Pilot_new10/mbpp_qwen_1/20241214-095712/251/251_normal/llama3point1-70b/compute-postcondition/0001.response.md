The code `phi = math.atan2(y, x)` assigns the value of the arctangent of `y/x` (in radians) to the variable `phi`. This function takes into account the signs of both `x` and `y` to determine the correct quadrant of the angle. The value of `r` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a real number, `y` is a real number, `r` is sqrt(x^2 + y^2), `phi` is math.atan2(y, x)**
