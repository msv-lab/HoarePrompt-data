Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Î¸). The radius \( r \) is calculated using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which matches the results from the assertions. The angle \( \theta \) is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which correctly handles all quadrants and edge cases where \( x \) or \( y \) could be zero. Since the function passes all the given test cases and the formulas used are mathematically sound, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases within the scope of the problem description.
