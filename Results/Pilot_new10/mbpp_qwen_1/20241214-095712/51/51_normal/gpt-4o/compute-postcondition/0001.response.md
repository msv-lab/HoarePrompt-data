According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. The loop will execute if the `numbers` list has at least one element. 

Before the loop starts, the state is as follows:
- `product` is 1.

For the loop to execute, the `numbers` list must have at least one integer. 

State: **`product` is 1, `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer**
