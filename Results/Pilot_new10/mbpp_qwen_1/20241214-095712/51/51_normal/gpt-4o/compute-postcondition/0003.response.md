According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. The loop will continue as long as the list `numbers` has at least one integer.

At the end of the previous iteration, `product` is equal to `num`, which means `num` was the last element processed in the list `numbers`. Also, `numbers` must have had at least one integer to enter the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `numbers` must still have at least one integer remaining.

State: **`product` is the last processed number in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer remaining**
