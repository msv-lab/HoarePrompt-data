Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The assertions in the code verify this behavior with different sets of inputs, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and a mix of both. Since the function works as expected for the given examples and the problem description matches the implementation, the program is correct for every potential case described.
