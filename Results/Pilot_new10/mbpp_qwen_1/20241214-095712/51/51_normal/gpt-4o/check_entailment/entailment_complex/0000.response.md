Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide the product by the length of the list. However, the function `func_1` does not perform this operation correctly. Specifically:

1. **Return Value**: The function currently returns `None` because the `return` statement is placed after the function has already exited due to the `return result` line. Therefore, the function does not actually return the result of the multiplication divided by the length of the list.

2. **Logic Error**: The function initializes `numbers` as an empty list within the function, which means that the state of `numbers` after the for loop is not relevant to the problem. Instead, the function should use the input parameter `numbers`.

To correct the function, the code should be modified as follows:

```python
import math

def func_1(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # Check if the list is empty
        return 0  # Return 0 to handle the case where the list is empty
    
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
```

With this correction, the function will properly multiply all the numbers in the list and then divide the product by the length of the list, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
