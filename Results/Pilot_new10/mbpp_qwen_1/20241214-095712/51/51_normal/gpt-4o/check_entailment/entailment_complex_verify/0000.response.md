Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and divides the product by the length of the list. However, the annotated version of the code reveals a critical flaw. After the for loop, the state of the program indicates that `numbers` is an empty list because the loop iterates over the entire list, and `numbers` is implicitly treated as empty afterward. Therefore, the line `result = product / len(numbers)` attempts to divide by the length of an empty list, which results in a division by zero error. This error is not handled in the provided code, making the function incorrect according to the problem description.

Given the provided assertions and the nature of the operations, the function should work correctly if it properly maintains the input list and calculates the desired result. Since the current implementation leads to a division by zero, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is incorrect.
