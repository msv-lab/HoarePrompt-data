Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string in the tuple and appends its last character to the resulting list. All provided test cases and the general logic of the function ensure that it works as expected for the given problem description. Since there is no identified case where the program fails to meet the requirements, the function is correct.
