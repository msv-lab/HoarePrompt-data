Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input tuple and extracts the last character using negative indexing (`s[-1]`). Since the function correctly implements the described behavior for any tuple of strings, there are no edge cases or inputs where this function would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
