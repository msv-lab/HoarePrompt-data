Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string. The annotated version confirms this behavior, stating that the function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and extracts the last character of each string, returning a list containing these last characters. Since this matches the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate.
