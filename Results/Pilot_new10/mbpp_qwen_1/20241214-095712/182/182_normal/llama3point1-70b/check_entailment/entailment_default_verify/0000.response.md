Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The output hints confirm that the function uses list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and extract the last character, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function works for all potential cases, including edge cases such as empty strings or single-character strings, as it directly accesses the last character using `s[-1]`.
