Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` processes a tuple of strings and returns a list of the last characters from each string, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
