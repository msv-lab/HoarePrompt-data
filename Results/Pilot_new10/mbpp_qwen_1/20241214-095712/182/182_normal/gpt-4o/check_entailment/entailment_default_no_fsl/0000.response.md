Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index (last) element of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string in the tuple and appends its last character to the resulting list. The provided test cases and the problem description match the functionality of the code. Therefore, the program works correctly for the described task and all given examples.
