Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element from each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` effectively gets the last character of each string in the tuple. Based on the provided assertions, the function works as expected for the given test cases. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential issue with the current implementation that would cause it to fail for other valid inputs. Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description.
