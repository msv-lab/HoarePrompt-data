Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It finds the longest list within a list of lists and returns both the length of this longest list and the list itself. The examples given in the problem description are handled correctly by the function `func_1`. The code iterates through each list in the input `list_of_lists`, updates the maximum length and corresponding list whenever it encounters a longer list, and finally returns the length and the longest list. Since the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases and the general logic is sound, the program is correct.
