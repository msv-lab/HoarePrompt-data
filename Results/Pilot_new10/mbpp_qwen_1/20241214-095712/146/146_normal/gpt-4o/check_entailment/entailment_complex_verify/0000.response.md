Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the maximum length in a list of lists. The function initializes `max_len` and `max_list` to track the longest list and its length as it iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`. After completing the iteration, it returns the length of the longest list and the longest list itself, which aligns with the problem description. The provided assertions also confirm the correctness of the function under various scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
