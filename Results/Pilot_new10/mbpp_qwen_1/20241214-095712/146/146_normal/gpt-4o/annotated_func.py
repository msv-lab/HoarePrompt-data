    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_len` is the length of the longest list within `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` is the longest list among all the lists in `list_of_lists`.
    return max_len, max_list
    #`The program returns max_len which is the length of the longest list within `list_of_lists`, and max_list which is the longest list among all the lists in `list_of_lists`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It iterates through each list in `list_of_lists` to find the longest list and its length. It returns the length of the longest list (`max_len`) and the longest list itself (`max_list`).
