The code assigns the value of `lst` to `max_list`. Since the initial state mentions that `max_list` references the longest list among those longer than `max_len` if such a list exists, otherwise it remains the same, the assignment does not change the condition under which `max_list` is determined. The value of `max_list` is now set to `lst`, but the condition for it being the longest list among those longer than `max_len` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` references `lst`, otherwise it remains the same.**
