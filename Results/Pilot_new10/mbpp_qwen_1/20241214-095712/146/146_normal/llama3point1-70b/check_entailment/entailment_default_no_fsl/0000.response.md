Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns the maximum length of sublists and the first sublist that matches this maximum length. However, the problem description asks for a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case. For example, if the input `list_of_lists` contains multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function will only return the first one instead of all of them.
