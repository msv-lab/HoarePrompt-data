Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is not entirely accurate. While the function `func_1` correctly finds the list with the maximum length, it only returns the first sublist that matches this length, even if there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length. According to the problem description, the task is to find the list of maximum length, which implies returning all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one. Therefore, the function does not meet the full requirements of the problem description.
