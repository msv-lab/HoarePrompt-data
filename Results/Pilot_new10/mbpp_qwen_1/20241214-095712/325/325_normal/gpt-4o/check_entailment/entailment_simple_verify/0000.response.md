Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month has 30 days. The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which are the only months with 30 days. The function returns `True` for these months and `False` for others, matching the problem description. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
