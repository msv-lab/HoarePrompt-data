Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if the given month number contains 30 days by checking if the month is in the set `{4, 6, 9, 11}`. This set contains the month numbers (April, June, September, and November) which have 30 days. 

- For `func_1(6)`, it returns `True` because June has 30 days.
- For `func_1(2)`, it returns `False` because February (month number 2) does not have 30 days.
- For `func_1(12)`, it returns `False` because December does not have 30 days.

Thus, the program correctly identifies months with 30 days and those without, adhering to the problem description.
