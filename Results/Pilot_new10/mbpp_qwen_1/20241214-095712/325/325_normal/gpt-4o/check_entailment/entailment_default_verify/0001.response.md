Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 30 days by using a set of month numbers that have 30 days. The function returns `True` for months 4, 6, 9, and 11, and `False` for all other months. This aligns perfectly with the problem description and the output hints. The function correctly handles the test cases provided and would correctly handle all other potential cases as well. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
