Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days. The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` which contains the numbers of the months that have 30 days: 4, 6, 9, and 11. The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set and `False` otherwise. 

The annotated version of the code accurately describes the state of the program and its behavior. The function correctly handles all the test cases provided:
- For month 6, it returns `True` because June has 30 days.
- For month 2, it returns `False` because February typically does not have 30 days (it usually has 28 or 29 days).
- For month 12, it returns `False` because December does not have 30 days.

Since the function correctly identifies months with 30 days and those without, and since no other potential cases violate the problem description, the program is correct. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
