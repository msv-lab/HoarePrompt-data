Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the provided assertions confirm that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) and returns `False` for other months. The function logic aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to check if a given month number contains 30 days. The annotated version clearly shows the function's behavior for each test case, supporting the original assessment of correctness.
