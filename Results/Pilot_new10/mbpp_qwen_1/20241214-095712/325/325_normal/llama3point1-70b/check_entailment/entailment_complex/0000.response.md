Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not check if the input `month` is within the valid range of 1 to 12. According to the problem description, the function should accept an integer `month` such that \(1 \leq \text{month} \leq 12\) and return `True` if `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11; otherwise, it should return `False`. However, the provided implementation does not include any validation for the range of the input `month`. As a result, the function will return incorrect results for values outside the valid range, such as 0, 13, or any other value not between 1 and 12. For example, if `month` is 2 (which has 28 or 29 days), the function will still return `False`, even though the problem description does not specify that February should be included in the list of months with 30 days. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
