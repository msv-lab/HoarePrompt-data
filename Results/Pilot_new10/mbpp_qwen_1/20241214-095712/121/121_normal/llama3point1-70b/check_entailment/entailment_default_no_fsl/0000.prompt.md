You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `False` if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n`. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, it returns 7. For other values of `n`, it starts with `num` set to 7 and increments `num` until it finds a number that satisfies the conditions of being 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6 and is a prime number according to `func_1(num)`. Once such a number is found and it matches the required count, it returns that number.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
