You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic for finding Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) primes. The NSW primes are defined by the recurrence relation:

\[ S_0 = 0, \quad S_1 = 1, \quad S_{n+1} = 2S_n + S_{n-1} \]

The prime NSW numbers are those \( S_n \) that are prime. The program, however, is checking for primality and filtering based on the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`, which is a common but incorrect heuristic for primality (it only works for primes greater than 3). Additionally, the starting point for the sequence is hardcoded to 7, which is the first NSW prime, but the program does not generate the entire NSW sequence.

To fix this, the program needs to generate the NSW sequence and check each term for primality. Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    
    def is_prime(num):
        """Check if a number is prime."""
        if num < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    S = [0, 1]
    count = 1
    num = 7
    
    while count < n:
        next_S = 2 * S[-1] + S[-2]
        if is_prime(next_S):
            count += 1
        S.append(next_S)
    
    return num
```

This corrected function generates the NSW sequence and checks each term for primality until it finds the nth NSW prime.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `False` if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n`. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, it returns 7. For other values of `n`, it starts with `num` set to 7 and increments `num` until it finds a number that satisfies the conditions of being 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6 and is a prime number according to `func_1(num)`. Once such a number is found and it matches the required count, it returns that number. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
