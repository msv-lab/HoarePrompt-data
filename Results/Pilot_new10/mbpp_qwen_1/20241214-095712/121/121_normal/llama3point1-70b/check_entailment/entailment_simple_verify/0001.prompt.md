You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic for finding Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) primes. The NSW primes are defined by the recurrence relation:

\[ S_0 = 0, \quad S_1 = 1, \quad S_{n+1} = 2S_n + S_{n-1} \]

The prime NSW numbers are those \( S_n \) that are prime. The program, however, is checking for primality and filtering based on the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`, which is a common but incorrect heuristic for primality (it only works for primes greater than 3). Additionally, the starting point for the sequence is hardcoded to 7, which is the first NSW prime, but the program does not generate the entire NSW sequence.

To fix this, the program needs to generate the NSW sequence and check each term for primality. Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    
    def is_prime(num):
        """Check if a number is prime."""
        if num < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    S = [0, 1]
    count = 1
    num = 7
    
    while count < n:
        next_S = 2 * S[-1] + S[-2]
        if is_prime(next_S):
            count += 1
        S.append(next_S)
    
    return num
```

This corrected function generates the NSW sequence and checks each term for primality until it finds the nth NSW prime.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

        return False

        if n % i == 0:

    return True
    #The program returns True

    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is `n`; `num` is `6*n + 1` or `6*n + 5`; the function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True if the number `num` is either 1 more than a multiple of 6 or 5 more than a multiple of 6.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
