The code assigns the value `7` to the variable `num`. The initial values of `n` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is 1; `num` is 7.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is 1; `num` is 7**
