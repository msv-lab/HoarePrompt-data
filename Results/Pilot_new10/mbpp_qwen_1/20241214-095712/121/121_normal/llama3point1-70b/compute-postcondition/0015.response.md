`num` is incremented by 1. Initially, `num` is 7, so after the increment, `num` becomes 8. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is either 2 or equal to `n`; `num` is 8; the function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True if the number `num` is either 1 more than a multiple of 6 or 5 more than a multiple of 6, otherwise `count` equals `n`.**
