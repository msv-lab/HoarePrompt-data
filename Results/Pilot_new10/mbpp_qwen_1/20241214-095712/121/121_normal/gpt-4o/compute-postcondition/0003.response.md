The code initializes two variables `S0` and `S1` to 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `S0` and `S1` have been assigned the value 1, while `n` retains its original value, which is a positive integer and not 0 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and is neither 0 nor 1; `S0` is 1; `S1` is 1**
