Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `S0` is the nth term in the sequence defined by \(S_0 = 1\), \(S_1 = 1\), and \(S_{i} = 2S_{i-1} + S_{i-2}\) for \(i \geq 2\), `S1` is the (n+1)th term in the same sequence, `i` is `n`.**

Explanation:
1. **Initial Values and Loop Structure**: The loop starts with `S0` and `S1` both set to 1. For each iteration, the next term `S_next` is calculated using the formula \(S_next = 2 \cdot S1 + S0\). Then, the values of `S0` and `S1` are updated to `S1` and `S_next`, respectively.

2. **First Iteration**: After the first iteration (when `i` is 2), the values become `S0 = 1` and `S1 = 3`.
3. **Second Iteration**: After the second iteration (when `i` is 3), the values become `S0 = 3` and `S1 = 7`.
4. **General Pattern**: Observing the pattern, we see that `S0` and `S1` follow the recurrence relation of the Fibonacci-like sequence where each term is twice the previous term plus the term before that. Specifically, the sequence starts as \(1, 1, 3, 7, 17, \ldots\).

5. **Final Values**: After executing the loop \(n\) times, `S0` will be the \(n\)th term and `S1` will be the \((n+1)\)th term in this sequence. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from 2 to `n + 1`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations is as described above.
