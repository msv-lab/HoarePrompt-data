`S_next` is assigned the value of `2 * S1 + S0`. Given that `S0` is 1 and `S1` is 3, the value of `S_next` is calculated as `2 * 3 + 1`, which equals 7. The values of `n`, `S0`, `S1`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**
