Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. The output hints suggest that the sequence should be generated according to the recurrence relation \(S_i = 2S_{i-1} + S_{i-2}\) starting with \(S_0 = 1\) and \(S_1 = 1\). However, the problem description asks for the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, which means the function should return the nth prime number in this specific sequence.

The code incorrectly returns 1 for any \(n \geq 1\), instead of generating the sequence according to the recurrence relation and then finding the prime numbers in that sequence. For example, for \(n = 3\), the correct output should be the 4th term in the sequence that is also a prime number, which is 7, but the code returns 7 directly, which is not necessarily the nth prime in the sequence.

To correctly solve this problem, the code needs to generate the sequence according to the recurrence relation, then filter out the prime numbers from this sequence, and finally return the nth prime number in the sequence.
