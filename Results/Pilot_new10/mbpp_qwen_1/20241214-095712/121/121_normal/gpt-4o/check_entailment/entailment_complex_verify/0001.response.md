Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not generate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. The annotated version confirms that the function generates a sequence based on a specific recurrence relation but does not match the sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. The provided test cases (7, 17, 41) are correct according to the sequence defined by the function, but these are not the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
