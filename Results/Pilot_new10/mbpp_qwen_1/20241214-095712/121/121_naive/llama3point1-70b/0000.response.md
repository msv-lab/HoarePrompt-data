Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. According to the definition, the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence is derived from the recurrence relation \( P_n = 2 \cdot P_{n-1}^2 - 1 \) with \( P_0 = 7 \). However, the current implementation does not follow this sequence. Instead, it checks for prime numbers and filters them based on their modulus with 6. This approach will not generate the correct sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. For example, the first few terms of the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence are 7, 47, 227, etc., which cannot be generated by the given code.
