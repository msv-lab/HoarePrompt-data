The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers and contains at least two distinct integers. The function returns the second element of the list `unique_nums` if it has more than one element, otherwise, it returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nums` of integers (with at least two distinct integers) and return the second element of the list if it has more than one element, otherwise, return `None`.
