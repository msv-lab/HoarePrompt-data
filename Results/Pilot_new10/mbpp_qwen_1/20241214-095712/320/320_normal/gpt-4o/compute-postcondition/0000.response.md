The code `unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))` impacts the program by first converting the list `nums` into a set to remove duplicates, and then sorting the resulting set to create a new list `unique_nums`. Since `nums` contains at least two distinct integers, the set will contain those distinct integers, and the sorted function will order them in ascending order.

Output State: **`unique_nums` is a sorted list of the distinct integers from `nums`, and `nums` contains at least two distinct integers.**
