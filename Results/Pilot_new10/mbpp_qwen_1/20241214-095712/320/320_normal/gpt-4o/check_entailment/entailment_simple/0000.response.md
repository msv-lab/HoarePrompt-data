Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the second smallest number in a list. The function should return `None` if the list does not contain at least two distinct integers.

2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1(nums)` takes a list `nums` as input.
   - It first converts the list into a set to remove duplicates (`set(nums)`).
   - Then, it sorts the set to get a sorted list of unique elements (`sorted(set(nums))`).
   - Finally, it checks if the length of this sorted list of unique elements is greater than 1. If so, it returns the second element (i.e., `unique_nums[1]`). Otherwise, it returns `None`.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - The test cases provided verify different scenarios:
     - `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])`: The unique, sorted numbers are `[-8, -2, 0, 1, 2]`. The second smallest number is `-2`, which is returned.
     - `func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2])`: The unique, sorted numbers are `[-2, -0.5, 0, 1, 2]`. The second smallest number is `-0.5`, which is returned.
     - `func_1([2, 2])`: There is only one unique number, so `None` is returned.
     - `func_1([2, 2, 2])`: Again, there is only one unique number, so `None` is returned.

The program correctly handles all the test cases and adheres to the problem description by returning the second smallest number if it exists and `None` otherwise. Therefore, the program is correct.
