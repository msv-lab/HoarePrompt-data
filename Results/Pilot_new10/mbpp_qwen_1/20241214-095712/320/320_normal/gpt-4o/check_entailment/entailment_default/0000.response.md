Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the second smallest number in a list. It first removes duplicate elements by converting the list to a set, then sorts the unique elements, and finally returns the second element if there are at least two unique elements. If there is only one unique element or no unique elements, it returns `None`.

This approach handles all the given test cases and potential edge cases:
1. For the list `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the unique and sorted elements are `[-8, -2, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest number is `-2`.
2. For the list `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the unique and sorted elements are `[-2, -0.5, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest number is `-0.5`.
3. For the list `[2, 2]`, since there is only one unique element, the function returns `None`.
4. For the list `[2, 2, 2]`, similarly, the function returns `None` because there is only one unique element.

Since the code handles all the given assertions and edge cases correctly, the program is correct.
