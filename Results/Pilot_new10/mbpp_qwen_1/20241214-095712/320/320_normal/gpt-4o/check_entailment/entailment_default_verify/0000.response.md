Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in the list. However, the output hints indicate that the function only accepts a list of integers with at least two distinct integers. The function does not handle cases where the list contains non-integer types or floats, which contradicts the problem description that specifies finding the second smallest number in a list, which could include floating-point numbers. For example, the second test case includes a floating-point number (-0.5), which the function should be able to handle. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate because the function does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
