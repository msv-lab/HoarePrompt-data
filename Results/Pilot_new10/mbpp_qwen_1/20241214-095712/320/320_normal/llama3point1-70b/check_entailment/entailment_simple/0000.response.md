Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the requirement to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. **Identifying Unique Elements**: The program first converts the list `nums` into a set `unique_nums` to remove any duplicate elements. Since sets only contain unique elements, this ensures that all elements in `unique_nums` are distinct.

2. **Checking for Minimum Unique Elements**: Before proceeding, the program checks if there are at least two unique elements in `unique_nums`. If there are fewer than two unique elements, the function correctly returns `None`.

3. **Returning the Second Smallest Element**: After ensuring there are at least two unique elements, the program sorts the `unique_nums` list and returns the second element in the sorted list, which is the second smallest number.

Given these steps, the program correctly identifies and returns the second smallest number when such a number exists. It handles cases where the list contains fewer than two distinct elements by returning `None`, as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
