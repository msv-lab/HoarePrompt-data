Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the list contains duplicate elements that are the smallest or second smallest. Specifically, if the list contains fewer than two unique elements, the function will return `None`. However, the problem description does not specify that the list should contain at least two unique elements. If the list contains fewer than two elements or all elements are the same, the function should still return the correct result based on the provided elements. For example, if the list is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, the function returns `None`, which is incorrect since the second smallest number should be `1`.

To fix this, the function should check if there are at least two elements in the list before proceeding. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:
        return min(unique_nums) if unique_nums else None
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
```

This version ensures that the function handles cases where the list contains duplicate elements correctly.
