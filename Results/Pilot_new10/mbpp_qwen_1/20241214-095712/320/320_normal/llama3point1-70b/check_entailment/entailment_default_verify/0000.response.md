Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle cases where there are duplicate smallest numbers. The output hints confirm that the function removes duplicates before finding the second smallest number, which means it cannot correctly identify the second smallest number in cases like `[1, 1, 2]`, where the second smallest number is `2`, but the function returns `1`. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
