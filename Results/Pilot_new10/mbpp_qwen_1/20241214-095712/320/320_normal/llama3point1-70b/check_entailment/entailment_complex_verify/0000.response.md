Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clarifies that the function `func_1` correctly handles the requirement to find the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates and then sorting the unique elements. The original assessment was based on the assumption that the input list could contain duplicate smallest numbers, which is addressed in the annotated version. Since the annotated version shows that the program correctly identifies the second smallest number even when there are duplicate smallest numbers, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is not accurate.
