Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. It first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and then sorting it.
2. If the sorted list has more than one unique element, it returns the second element (which is the second smallest).
3. If the list has less than two unique elements, it returns `None`.

Given the assertions:
- For `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the output is `-2`, which is correct.
- For `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the output is `-0.5`, which is correct.
- For `[2, 2]`, the output is `None`, which is correct because there is only one unique element.
- For `[2, 2, 2]`, the output is `None`, which is also correct because there is no second smallest element.

Since the function handles all the provided cases correctly and logically, it appears to be correct for the described problem.
