Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly adds the elements of the given tuple to the end of the given list. The function concatenates the list with a converted list from the tuple using the `+` operator, which is a valid approach. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and all pass, indicating that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Since no specific edge cases or additional inputs contradict the function's behavior, we can conclude that the function meets the requirements for all potential cases described.
