Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly adds the elements of the tuple to the end of the list. The function converts the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)` and then concatenates it with the original list `lst` using the `+` operator. This approach ensures that all elements from both the list and the tuple are included in the resulting list. Given the provided test cases, the function works as expected. Since no counterexample has been found, the function appears to handle the task correctly for the described problem.
