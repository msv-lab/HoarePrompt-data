Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `input_list` (a list) and `input_tuple` (a tuple).
2. Inside the function, `input_tuple` is converted to a list using `list(input_tuple)`.
3. The function then concatenates `input_list` with the newly created list from `input_tuple` and returns the result.

The return postcondition states: "The program returns a list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and a list converted from `input_tuple`."

The annotated code matches the actual code and the return postcondition. There are no edge cases or missing functionality mentioned in the annotations that conflict with the actual code.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, converts `input_tuple` to a list, concatenates it with `input_list`, and returns the concatenated list.**
