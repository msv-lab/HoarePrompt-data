Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, converts `input_tuple` to a list, and then concatenates it with `input_list`. This exactly matches the problem description. The function works correctly for all potential cases, including handling different lengths of lists and tuples. There are no edge cases or examples where this function would fail based on the given problem description and hints.
