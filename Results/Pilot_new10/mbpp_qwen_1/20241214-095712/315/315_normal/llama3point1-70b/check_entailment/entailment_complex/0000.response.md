Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `input_list`, which is a list, and `input_tuple`, which is a tuple. It then converts the tuple to a list using `list(input_tuple)` and concatenates it with `input_list`. The result is returned as a new list. This behavior exactly matches the problem description, which states that the function should add the given tuple to the given list. Since the function always performs this operation regardless of the contents of the input list or tuple, it adheres to the problem description in all cases.
