Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the provided test cases confirm that the function `func_1` correctly concatenates a list with a tuple by converting the tuple into a list. The function behaves as expected, and the original assessment correctly identifies that the function is correct based on the problem description. The annotations further validate this understanding by clearly stating the operations performed within the function.
