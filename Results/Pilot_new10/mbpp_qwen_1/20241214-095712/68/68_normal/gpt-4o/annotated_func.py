#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are integers or floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are integers or floating-point numbers, and returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`.
