Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the provided problem description and the original assessment. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The provided assertions in the form of `math.isclose` calls verify the correctness of the function for the given test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
