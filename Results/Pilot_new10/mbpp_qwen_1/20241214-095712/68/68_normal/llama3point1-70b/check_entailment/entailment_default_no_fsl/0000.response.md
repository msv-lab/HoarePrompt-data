Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(real, imag)` takes two floating-point numbers as input, creates a complex number using these real and imaginary parts, and returns the phase angle of the complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. This matches the problem description perfectly. The `cmath.phase()` function calculates the phase angle of a complex number, which is exactly what the problem requires. Since the function handles all valid inputs correctly and the problem description and output hints align with the provided code, the program is correct for every potential case.
