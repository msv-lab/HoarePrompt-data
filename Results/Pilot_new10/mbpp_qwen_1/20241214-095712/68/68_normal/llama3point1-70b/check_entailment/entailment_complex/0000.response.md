Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then creates a complex number using these parts and returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. This exactly matches the requirement to write a function to get the angle of a complex number. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
