Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array (list of integers). The function works by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and then returning their difference. This approach is correct and will work for all potential cases of input arrays. The given test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for the provided inputs. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
