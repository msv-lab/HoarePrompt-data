Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the minimum and maximum values and computing their difference. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list of integers and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. The test cases provided in the problem description cover various scenarios and all pass, indicating that the function is correct for these cases. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues with the current implementation that would cause it to fail for any other valid input, given the assumption that the input will be valid.
