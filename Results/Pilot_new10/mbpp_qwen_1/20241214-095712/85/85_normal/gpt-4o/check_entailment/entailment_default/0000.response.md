Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by determining the minimum and maximum values in the array and then calculating their difference. The examples given in the output hints also correctly demonstrate the expected behavior of the function:

- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `5`, so the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `9`, so the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `3`, so the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Since the code works correctly for the given examples and there are no apparent issues with edge cases or other potential inputs, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in every case.
