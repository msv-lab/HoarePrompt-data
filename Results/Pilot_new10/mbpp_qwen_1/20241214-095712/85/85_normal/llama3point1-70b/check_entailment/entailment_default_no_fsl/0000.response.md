Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach works for all potential cases where the array contains at least two distinct elements. The function handles both positive and negative integers, as well as arrays with repeated values. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
