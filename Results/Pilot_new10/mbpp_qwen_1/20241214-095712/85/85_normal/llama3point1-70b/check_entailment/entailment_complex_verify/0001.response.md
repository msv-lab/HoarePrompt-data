Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. The annotated version clearly states that the function accepts a list of integers and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
