Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original program logic correctly implement the functionality to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`arr`), computes the maximum value and the minimum value within the list, and returns their difference. This approach is accurate and works for all valid input cases as per the problem description. The original assessment was accurate in concluding that the program is correct.
