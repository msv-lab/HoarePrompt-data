Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list of integers and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list. Since the function accurately computes the maximum difference for any valid input array as per the problem description, the original assessment is accurate.
