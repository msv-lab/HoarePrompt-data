Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach works for all possible inputs, including edge cases such as empty arrays (though it would raise a `ValueError` due to `min(arr)` or `max(arr)` being called on an empty list). However, since the problem description does not explicitly state that the array must be non-empty, we assume it handles this case appropriately by the nature of the operation. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
