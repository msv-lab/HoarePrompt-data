Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days based on the problem description. The function uses a list of month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the input month number is in this list, otherwise it returns `False`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the valid inputs within the range 1 to 12, covering all the potential cases for month numbers containing 31 days. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.
