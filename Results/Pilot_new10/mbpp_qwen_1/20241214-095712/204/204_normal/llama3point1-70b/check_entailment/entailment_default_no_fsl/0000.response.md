Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given month number `n` (where `n` is an integer between 1 and 12) contains 31 days. The function uses a list `months_31_days` which contains the month numbers that have 31 days. It returns `True` if `n` is in this list, and `False` otherwise. Since the problem description asks for a function that checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not, and the function correctly implements this logic, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
