Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 31 days or not by using a list of month numbers that have 31 days. The function works as expected for all potential cases of month numbers (1 through 12), returning `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for those without. The output hints also correctly summarize the functionality of the function, confirming its accuracy in handling all valid inputs within the specified range.
