Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` where `1 <= month <= 12` and returns `True` if `month` is one of the following: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12. Otherwise, it returns `False`.** 

This summary covers all potential cases as specified by the code and annotations. The function checks if the given `month` is within the specified range and then determines whether it matches one of the months with 31 days, returning `True` or `False` accordingly.
