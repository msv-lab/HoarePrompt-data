Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month has 31 days by using a set of month numbers that contain 31 days. The provided test cases cover all the months that have 31 days and those that do not. Since the function behaves as expected for all tested cases and the logic is sound, the program is correct. The annotation clearly states that the function returns `True` if the month is in the set `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}` and `False` otherwise, which aligns with the problem description and test cases.
