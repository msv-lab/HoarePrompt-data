Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. According to the problem description, this means checking if the month is one of the months that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December).

The program uses a set `months_with_31_days` containing the integers corresponding to these months (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12). It then checks if the input `month` is in this set. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating the month has 31 days; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The provided test cases assert the function's behavior for various months, confirming its correctness across all possible valid inputs (1 through 12). Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
