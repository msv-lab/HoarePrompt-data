Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` checks if the given month number is in the set `months_with_31_days`, which correctly identifies the months with 31 days. The provided assertions cover all the relevant cases and demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. The function returns `True` for months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and `False` for those without (2, 4, 6, 9, 11). Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations.
