Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. It checks if the given month number (where `1 <= month <= 12`) contains 31 days by checking if the month is in the set `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`. The assertions provided in the code cover all the cases where months have 31 days and where they do not, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case.
