Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input, combines them into a single list using the `+` operator, sorts the combined list in ascending order using the `sorted()` function, and returns the sorted list. This approach ensures that the returned list contains all elements from the input lists in sorted order, which is exactly what the problem description requires. The provided test cases also validate this behavior, showing that the function works correctly for different inputs. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
