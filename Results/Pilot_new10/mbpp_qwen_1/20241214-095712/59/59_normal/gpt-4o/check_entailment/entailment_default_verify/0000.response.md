Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list as per the problem description. The function concatenates the three input lists and sorts the combined list, ensuring that the output is sorted in ascending order. The output hints align with this behavior, confirming that the function accepts three lists of integers, concatenates them, sorts the result, and returns the sorted list. The original assessment is accurate because the function correctly implements the required functionality for all valid inputs based on the provided assertions.
