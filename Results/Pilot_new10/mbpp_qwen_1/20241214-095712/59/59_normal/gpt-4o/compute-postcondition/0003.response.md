The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Each of these parameters is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function returns `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, consisting of the elements from `list1`, followed by the elements from `list2`, followed by the elements from `list3`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of integers (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`), concatenate them, and return a single list of integers sorted in ascending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers. It returns a list of integers, `sorted_list`, which is the concatenation of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` sorted in ascending order.**
