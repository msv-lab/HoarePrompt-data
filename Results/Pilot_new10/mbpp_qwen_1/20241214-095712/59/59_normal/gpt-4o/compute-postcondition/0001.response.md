The `sorted_list` is assigned the sorted version of the `combined_list`. The original lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) and their order are preserved, but the elements in `combined_list` are rearranged in ascending order. 

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `list3` is a list of integers, `combined_list` is a list consisting of the elements of `list1`, followed by the elements of `list2`, followed by the elements of `list3`; `sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order**.
