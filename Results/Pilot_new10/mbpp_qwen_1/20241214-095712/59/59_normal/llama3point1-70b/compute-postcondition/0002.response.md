The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are all lists of integers. The function combines these lists into one list, sums their elements, and then returns the sorted version of this combined list. There are no additional annotations beyond what the code itself provides.

Let's summarize the functionality step-by-step:

1. The function takes three lists of integers as input.
2. It concatenates these three lists into a single list.
3. It sorts the concatenated list.
4. It returns the sorted list.

Given the annotations and the actual code, there are no missing functionalities or edge cases that need to be considered further. Therefore, the functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three lists of integers (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`), combines them into one list, sorts the combined list, and returns the sorted list.**
