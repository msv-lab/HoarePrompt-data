Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into one list using the `+` operator, and then sorts the combined list using the `sorted` function. This approach ensures that the resulting list is always sorted, and the annotations support this behavior. Therefore, the program meets the requirement of merging three lists into a single sorted list, making the original assessment correct.
