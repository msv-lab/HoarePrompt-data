Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists of integers (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input, combines them into a single list using the `+` operator, sorts the combined list using the `sorted` function, and returns the sorted list. This behavior fully aligns with the problem description, which requires merging three lists into a single sorted list. Since the function performs the required operation correctly for any input lists of integers, the program is correct.
