Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list. The approach taken in the function is to first combine the three lists using `list1 + list2 + list3`, and then sort the resulting combined list using `sorted()`. This method ensures that the final list is sorted in ascending order.

The function has been tested with multiple assertions that cover various scenarios, including lists with overlapping elements and different lengths. The results from the assertions show that the function behaves correctly in all tested cases. Since the provided code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the given examples work correctly, the function is considered correct.
