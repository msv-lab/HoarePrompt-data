Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The function `func_1` iterates through all indices from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index \( i \) is even, and if so, adds the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{i} \) to the sum. This approach aligns with the problem description, which requires finding the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

The program handles all potential cases as described, including:
- When \( n = 0 \), the sum will be 0 since there are no even indices.
- For any positive \( n \), the program correctly sums the binomial coefficients at even indices.

Since the program works correctly for all tested cases and the logic matches the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
