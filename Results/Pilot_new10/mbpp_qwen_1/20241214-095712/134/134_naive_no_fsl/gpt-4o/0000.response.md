Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is indeed the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). This is a known property in combinatorics, specifically related to the binomial theorem. For any positive integer \(n\), the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients in the expansion of \((1 + 1)^n\) is \(2^{(n-1)}\).

Given the test cases:
- `func_1(4) == 8`: The sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for \(n=4\) is \(2^3 = 8\).
- `func_1(6) == 32`: The sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for \(n=6\) is \(2^5 = 32\).
- `func_1(2) == 2`: The sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for \(n=2\) is \(2^1 = 2\).

Since the function works correctly for these test cases and the mathematical property holds true for all positive integers \(n\), the program is correct.
