Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The sum of even index binomial coefficients for a binomial expansion \((1 + 1)^n\) is \(2^{(n-1)}\), which matches the formula used in the program. The assertions provided in the code also confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs (4, 6, and 2). Since the program meets the requirements for every potential case described by the problem, the correctness is **True**.
