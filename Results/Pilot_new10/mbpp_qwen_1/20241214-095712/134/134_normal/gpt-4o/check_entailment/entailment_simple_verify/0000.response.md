Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients using the formula \(2^{n-1}\), which is consistent with the binomial theorem. The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
