Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` accepts a positive integer \( n \) and returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \), which is indeed the correct formula for the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The provided test cases also confirm that the function is working as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
