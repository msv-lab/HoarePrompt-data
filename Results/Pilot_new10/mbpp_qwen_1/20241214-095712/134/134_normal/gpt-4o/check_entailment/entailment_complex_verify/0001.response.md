Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is indeed the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The annotated version confirms that the function takes a positive integer \(n\) and returns \(2^{(n-1)}\), aligning with the problem description. The provided test cases validate this behavior. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
