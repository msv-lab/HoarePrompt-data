Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes \(2^{(n-1)}\), which matches the sum of even-index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). This can be verified by the provided assertions:

- For \(n = 4\), the sum of even-index binomial coefficients is \(2^{(4-1)} = 2^3 = 8\).
- For \(n = 6\), the sum of even-index binomial coefficients is \(2^{(6-1)} = 2^5 = 32\).
- For \(n = 2\), the sum of even-index binomial coefficients is \(2^{(2-1)} = 2^1 = 2\).

Since the function works correctly for these cases and the formula \(2^{(n-1)}\) holds true for the sum of even-index binomial coefficients, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
