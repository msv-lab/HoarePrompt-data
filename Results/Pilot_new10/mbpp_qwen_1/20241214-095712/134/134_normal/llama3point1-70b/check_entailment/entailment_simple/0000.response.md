Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n)` is defined to take a single positive integer `n` as input.
2. **Initialization**: A variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will store the cumulative sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients.
3. **Loop Execution**: A `for` loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if the current index `i` is even using the condition `if i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, it calculates the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the `sum`.
4. **Return Statement**: After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum`, which is the sum of the binomial coefficients for all even indices from 0 to `n`.

The program accurately follows the logic required to find the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients. Therefore, it meets the problem description for any positive integer input `n`.
