Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both correctly reflect the behavior of the program. The function `func_1` indeed calculates the sum of binomial coefficients for even indices from 0 to \( n \). The annotation accurately describes the state of the program after the for loop, indicating that `i` is `n + 1` and `sum` contains the required sum. The original assessment correctly identifies the program's correctness based on the problem description.
