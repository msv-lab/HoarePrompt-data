Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The annotations clearly state that after the for loop, `i` is `n + 1` and `sum` contains the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`. Since the program logic matches the problem description and there are no errors or edge cases mentioned in the annotations, the original assessment is accurate.
