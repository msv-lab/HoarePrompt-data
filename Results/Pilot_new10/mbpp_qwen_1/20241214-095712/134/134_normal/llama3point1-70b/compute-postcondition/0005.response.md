According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer and `sum` is updated to include `math.comb(n, i)` because `i` is even.

To determine the new state for the next iteration:

1. The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n + 1`.
2. Since `i` was even in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` must be odd (if it continues to be incremented) or even but less than `n + 1`.

Assuming `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (which is even), the new value of `i` will be odd. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is an odd integer, and `sum` is the original sum plus `math.comb(n, i)` because `i` is even and now `i` is incremented to an odd number.**
