`sum` is assigned the value of `sum + math.comb(n, i)`. Since `i` is even and its current value is even, it remains unchanged. The value of `math.comb(n, i)` depends on the specific value of `n` and `i`, but since `i` is even, the term `math.comb(n, i)` is included in the sum. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is an even integer; `sum` is the original sum plus math.comb(n, i)**
