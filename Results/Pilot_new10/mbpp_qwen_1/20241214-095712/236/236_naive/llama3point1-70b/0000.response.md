Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not preserve the original order of elements. For a list to be considered sorted, each element must be less than or equal to the next element in sequence. The function should compare adjacent elements instead of sorting the entire list and comparing.

For example, consider the list `[1, 3, 2]`. This list is not sorted, but `func_1([1, 3, 2])` would return `True` because sorting it results in `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted. 

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

This implementation ensures that each element is less than or equal to the next element, thus correctly identifying if the list is sorted.
