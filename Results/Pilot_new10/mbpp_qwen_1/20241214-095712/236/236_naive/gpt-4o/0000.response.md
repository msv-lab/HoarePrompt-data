Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether a list is sorted in ascending order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The examples provided also correctly validate this behavior:
- The first example `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` is sorted, so it returns `True`.
- The second example `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` contains an unsorted pair (14, 20), so it returns `False`.
- The third example `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` contains an unsorted pair (15, 14), so it returns `False`.

Since the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases and the logic appears to handle all necessary conditions for determining if a list is sorted, the program is correct.
