Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after completing the iteration.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
1. A fully sorted list: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` (returns `True`).
2. A list that is mostly sorted but has a pair out of order: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` (returns `False`).
3. A list that is not sorted due to a swap in the middle: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` (returns `False`).

Since the function behaves as expected in these cases and no other edge cases or potential issues are identified, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.
