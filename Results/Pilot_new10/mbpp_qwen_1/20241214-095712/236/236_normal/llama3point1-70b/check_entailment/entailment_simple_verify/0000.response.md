Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not preserve the original order of elements when checking if a list is sorted. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it becomes clear that the function is actually checking if the list is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version. This method is correct for determining if a list is sorted, as long as the comparison is done correctly. The annotated version confirms that the function handles various edge cases correctly, such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with repeated elements that maintain the sorted order. Therefore, the original assessment was not accurate, and the function is indeed correct for the given problem description.
