Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1(nums)` correctly checks whether the input list `nums` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it with its sorted version. The annotated version clearly states that the function handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with repeated elements that maintain the sorted order. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
