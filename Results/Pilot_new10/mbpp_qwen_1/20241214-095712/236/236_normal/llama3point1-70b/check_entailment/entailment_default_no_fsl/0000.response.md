Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. This approach works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Empty List**: An empty list is considered sorted, and `sorted([])` also returns an empty list, so the comparison `[] == []` is `True`.
2. **Single Element List**: A list with a single element is trivially sorted, and `sorted([x])` returns `[x]`, so the comparison `[x] == [x]` is `True`.
3. **List with Repeated Elements**: The function correctly identifies that a list with repeated elements is sorted if they are in the correct order, e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 3]` is sorted.
4. **Unsorted List**: Any unsorted list will not match its sorted version, so the comparison will be `False`.

Since the function works correctly for all these cases, the correctness is **True**.
