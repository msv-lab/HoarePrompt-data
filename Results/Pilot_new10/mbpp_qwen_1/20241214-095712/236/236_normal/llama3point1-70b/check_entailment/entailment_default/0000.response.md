Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. It handles several edge cases:

1. **Empty List**: An empty list is considered sorted.
2. **Single Element List**: A list with a single element is also considered sorted.
3. **List with Repeated Elements**: The function will still consider a list with repeated elements as sorted if the order is maintained.
4. **Unsorted List**: Any unsorted list will return `False`.

The function works correctly for these cases. Additionally, the function `nums == sorted(nums)` ensures that the original list `nums` is compared with its sorted version. If both are identical, it means the list was already sorted, which is exactly what the function is supposed to check. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
