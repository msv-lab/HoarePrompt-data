Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1(nums)` correctly checks if a given list `nums` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version. The explanation in the original assessment is accurate, as the function works correctly for all potential cases, including edge cases like an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with repeated elements that maintain the sorted order. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
