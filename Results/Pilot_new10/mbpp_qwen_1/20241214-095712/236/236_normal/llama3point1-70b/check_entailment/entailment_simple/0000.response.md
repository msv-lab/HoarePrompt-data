Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` correctly checks whether the list `nums` is sorted or not. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks if a specified list is sorted.
2. **Function Implementation**: 
   - The function takes a list `nums` as input.
   - It compares `nums` with its sorted version using the `sorted(nums)` function.
   - It returns `True` if both lists are identical (i.e., `nums` is already sorted), and `False` otherwise.
3. **Correctness**:
   - For any list `nums`, the expression `nums == sorted(nums)` will evaluate to `True` if and only if `nums` is sorted. This is because `sorted(nums)` returns a new list that is sorted in ascending order, and comparing this with the original list will show if they are identical.
   - This logic holds true for all possible inputs, including empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with multiple elements in various orders.

Thus, the function always meets the requirement of checking whether a specified list is sorted, making the program correct.
