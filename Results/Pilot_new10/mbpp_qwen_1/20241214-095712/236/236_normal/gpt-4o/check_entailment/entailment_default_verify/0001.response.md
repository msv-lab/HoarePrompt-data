Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The output hints correctly describe the behavior of the function, indicating that it returns `False` if any element is greater than the next element, and `True` otherwise. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the function being correct is accurate.
