Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list is sorted in ascending order. The function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The provided assertions and the output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
