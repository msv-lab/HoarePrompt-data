Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `lst` is a list of comparable elements that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The first element of the list is not greater than the second element.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(lst) - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since the loop condition is `i < len(lst) - 1`, the length of `lst` must be such that `len(lst) - 1 > 1`, meaning `len(lst) > 2`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `lst` must still be a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements (and now we know it must have at least 3 elements).
   - `i` should be 1.
   - No information about the comparison between elements is given for the next iteration, so we don't need to change anything related to that.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `lst` must be a list of comparable elements that has at least 3 elements.
   - `i` must be 1.

**Answer:**
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1**.
