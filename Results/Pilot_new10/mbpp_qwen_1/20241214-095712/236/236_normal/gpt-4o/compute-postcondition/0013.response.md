Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns `False` if any element in the list is greater than the next element. Otherwise, it returns `True`.** 

This summary covers the following:
- The function iterates through the list and checks if any element is greater than its subsequent element.
- If such an element is found, the function immediately returns `False`.
- If no such element is found after checking all pairs, the function returns `True`.

Since the code directly checks each pair of elements in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an out-of-order pair, there are no edge cases or missing logic that need to be addressed in the functionality summary.
