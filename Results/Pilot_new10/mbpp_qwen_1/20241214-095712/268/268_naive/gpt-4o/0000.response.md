Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The function iterates through each row of the matrix, extracts the element at the specified column index, and then returns the maximum value found in that column. The assertions provided cover different scenarios and confirm the correctness of the function. There are no apparent edge cases or errors in the given implementation that would cause it to fail for any potential input.
