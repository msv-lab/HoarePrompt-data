#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists where each inner list represents a row in the matrix, and n is an integer such that 0 <= n < the number of columns in the matrix.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
    #The program returns the maximum value among the nth elements of each row in the matrix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value among the `n`th elements of each row in the matrix. This includes handling cases where `n` might be out of bounds for some rows, in which case the function will still attempt to access the `n`th element, potentially leading to errors if the row length is less than `n`.
