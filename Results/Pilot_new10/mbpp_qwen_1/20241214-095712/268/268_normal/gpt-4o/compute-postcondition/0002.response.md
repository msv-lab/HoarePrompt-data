The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `matrix`, which is a list of lists where each inner list represents a row in the matrix, and `n`, which is an integer such that \(0 \leq n < \) the number of columns in the matrix. The function returns the maximum value among the `n`th elements of each row in the matrix.

Functionality: **The function accepts a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value among the `n`th elements of each row in the matrix.**
