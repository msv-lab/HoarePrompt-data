The code creates a new list `nth_column` which contains the nth element from each row of the matrix. The values of `matrix` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`matrix` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a row in the matrix, `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n < the number of columns in the matrix, and `nth_column` is a list containing the nth element from each row of `matrix`.**
