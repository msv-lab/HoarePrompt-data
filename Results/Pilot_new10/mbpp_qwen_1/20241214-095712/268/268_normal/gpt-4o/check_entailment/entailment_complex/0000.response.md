Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a matrix (represented as a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value among the `n`th elements of each row in the matrix. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires a function that, given a matrix and an integer `n`, returns the maximum value in the `n`th column of the matrix.
2. **Implementation**: 
   - The function first creates a list `nth_column` by extracting the `n`th element from each row using a list comprehension: `[row[n] for row in matrix]`.
   - It then returns the maximum value from this list using the `max` function.

The provided test cases also validate this behavior:
- `assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19` checks the third column, which contains the values `[7, 5, 19]`, and the maximum is `19`.
- `assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10` checks the second column, which contains the values `[7, 4, 10]`, and the maximum is `10`.
- `assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11` checks the second column, which contains the values `[8, 5, 11]`, and the maximum is `11`.

Since the function correctly extracts the `n`th column and returns the maximum value as required, the program is correct according to the problem description.
