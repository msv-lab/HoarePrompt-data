Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the state and behavior of the program. The function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of the given matrix, as per the problem description. The assertions provided in the annotated version serve to validate the correctness of the function across different scenarios. Given the assumptions about valid inputs, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains accurate.
