Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the program is correct for all potential cases. However, the output hints indicate that the function may attempt to access an element that does not exist in a row if `n` is greater than the length of that row. This can lead to an `IndexError`. Since the function does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds for a row, the program is not correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
