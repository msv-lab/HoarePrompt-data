Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return the maximum value of the n'th column in a given matrix. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the logic within the function is sound. Since the annotations align with the provided code and the problem description, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains accurate.
