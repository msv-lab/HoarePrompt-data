Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function is correct, but upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it appears that the function does not handle the case where the specified column index `n` is out of bounds for some rows. In Python, accessing an index that does not exist in a list will raise an `IndexError`. While the problem description assumes valid input, in practice, the function should include error handling to manage such cases. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate because the function is not robust against invalid indices.
