Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of the given matrix. The state descriptions align with the expected behavior of the function, and there are no edge cases or special conditions mentioned in the problem description that this function fails to handle. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
