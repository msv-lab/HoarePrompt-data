Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the specified column (adjusting for zero-indexing by using `n - 1`) and applies the `max` function to find the maximum value. The output hints provided confirm that the function accepts a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value among the `(n-1)`th element of each row in the matrix. Since the program handles all valid cases as described in the problem description and there are no edge cases or special conditions mentioned that this function fails to handle, the original assessment is correct.
