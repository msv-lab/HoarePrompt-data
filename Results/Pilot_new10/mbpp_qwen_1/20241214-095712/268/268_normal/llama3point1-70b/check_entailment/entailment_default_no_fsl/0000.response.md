Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function as described. It takes a matrix (list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value of the `n`-th column. The code uses a generator expression to iterate over each row in the matrix and access the `n-1`th element of each row, which corresponds to the `n`-th column. The `max` function then finds and returns the maximum value from these elements. This approach works for any valid matrix and any valid `n` (where `n` is within the bounds of the matrix columns). Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
