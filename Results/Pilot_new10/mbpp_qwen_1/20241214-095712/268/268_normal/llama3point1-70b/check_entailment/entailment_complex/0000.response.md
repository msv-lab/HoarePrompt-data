Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the required functionality as per the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should return the maximum value of the `n`-th column in the matrix. However, the program returns the maximum value of the `(n-1)`-th element of each row instead. 

For example, consider a matrix `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]` and `n = 2`. The expected output should be `9` because the second column (index 1) contains the values `[3, 6, 9]`, and the maximum value among these is `9`. But the program will return `8` because it takes the second last element from each row, i.e., `[2, 5, 8]`, and the maximum value among these is `8`.

To fix this, the program should be changed to:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
```

This version correctly accesses the `n`-th element of each row to find the maximum value in the `n`-th column.
