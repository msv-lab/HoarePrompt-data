Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a matrix (represented as a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value among the `(n-1)`th element of each row in the matrix. The generator expression `(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)` iterates over each row in the matrix and extracts the `(n-1)`th element, and the `max` function finds the maximum value among these elements. This logic aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, as long as `n-1` is within the bounds of the rows in the matrix. If `n-1` is out of bounds, the code will raise an `IndexError`, but this is not the responsibility of the function to handle such cases; the caller should ensure that `n-1` is valid.
