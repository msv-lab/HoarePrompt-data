Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return the maximum value of the n'th column in a given matrix. The function extracts the n'th column using a list comprehension and then finds the maximum value using the `max()` function. 

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
1. The first test case checks a simple matrix with positive integers.
2. The second test case also checks a matrix with positive integers but in a different configuration.
3. The third test case again checks the functionality with a similar structure but different values.

Since the function handles the provided test cases correctly and the logic seems sound for finding the maximum value in any given column, the program is correct for all potential cases. There do not appear to be any edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the provided information.
