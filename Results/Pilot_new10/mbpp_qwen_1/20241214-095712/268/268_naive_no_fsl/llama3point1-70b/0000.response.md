Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of the given matrix. The function uses a generator expression to access the n'th element of each row (note that list indices in Python are zero-based, so `row[n - 1]` correctly accesses the n'th column). It then passes this generator to the `max` function, which returns the maximum value from the generated elements. This approach works for any valid matrix and any valid column index `n`. Since the function handles the problem description accurately for all potential cases, the correctness is True.
