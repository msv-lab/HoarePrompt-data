Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses a linear search approach to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. However, this approach does not guarantee correctness in all cases, especially when the element `x` is not present in the array. For instance, consider the following input:

```
arr = [2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]
x = 4
```

In this case, the function will return `-1`, which is the correct result since `4` is not present in the array. However, the problem description does not explicitly state that the function should handle non-existent elements. The issue arises when we consider the requirement to find the last position of an element, which should return `-1` if the element is not found. The current implementation correctly returns `-1` when the element is not found, but it does not strictly follow the problem description's requirement to handle sorted arrays effectively.

To ensure the program meets the requirements, a more efficient binary search approach could be used, which would correctly handle both cases where the element is present and where it is not. However, based on the given assertions and the current implementation, the program does not fail in finding the last position if the element exists, but it might not be the most optimal solution for larger arrays or when performance is a concern.
