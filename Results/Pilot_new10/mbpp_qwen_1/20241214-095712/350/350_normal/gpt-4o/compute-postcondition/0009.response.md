Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`. If `arr[i] == x`, the function returns `len(arr) - 3`. Otherwise, no specific change occurs to the variables, and the function continues execution with the same values as before the if statement.***
