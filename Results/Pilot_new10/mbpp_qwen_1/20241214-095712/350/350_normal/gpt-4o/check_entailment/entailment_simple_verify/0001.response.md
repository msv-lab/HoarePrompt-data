Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array by iterating from the end to the beginning. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct index for the last occurrence of the element or `-1` if the element is not found. The test cases in the annotations also validate the function's correctness.
