Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. However, based on the output hints, the function actually finds the first occurrence of the element when iterating in reverse order. This means the function does not meet the requirement of finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
