Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both correctly describe the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function iterates through the list in reverse to find the last occurrence of the target value `x`, and it correctly handles cases where `x` is not found in the list by returning `-1`. The provided assertions and annotations align with this behavior, confirming that the function meets the requirements of finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
