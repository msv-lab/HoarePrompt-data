Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of a given `target` element in a sorted array `arr`. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that finds the last position of a specified element in a sorted array.
2. **Implementation**:
   - The function iterates over the array from the end to the beginning using a `for` loop with the range `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`.
   - It checks each element from the last to the first. As soon as it finds an element equal to the target, it returns the index `i`.
   - If no such element is found, it returns `-1`.

Given these points, the program correctly identifies the last occurrence of the target element in the array:
- If the target element exists in the array, the function will return its last index.
- If the target element does not exist in the array, the function correctly returns `-1`.

Since the program handles all cases (both when the target is present and when it is not), it accurately fulfills the requirement of finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. Therefore, the program is correct.
