Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original problem description accurately reflect that the function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of the target element in a sorted array. The function iterates over the array in reverse order, ensuring that it finds the last occurrence of the target element. If the target is not found, it returns -1, which is consistent with the problem description and the provided annotations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
