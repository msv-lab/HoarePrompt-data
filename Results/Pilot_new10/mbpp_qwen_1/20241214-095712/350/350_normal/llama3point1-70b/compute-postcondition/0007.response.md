According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse order starting from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `i` is set to `len(arr) - 2`.

For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Since `i` is currently `len(arr) - 2`, we need to adjust `i` to `len(arr) - 3` for the next iteration to ensure the loop condition is met.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` should be decreased by 1, making it `len(arr) - 3`.
- `i` must still be greater than or equal to `0`.

State: **`i` is an integer such that `i = len(arr) - 3` and `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`.**
