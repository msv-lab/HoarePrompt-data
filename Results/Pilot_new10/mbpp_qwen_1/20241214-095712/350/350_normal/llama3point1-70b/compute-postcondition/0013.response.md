The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It iterates over the list in reverse order to find the first occurrence of `target`. If `target` is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence. If `target` is not found, it returns -1.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The function starts by iterating over the list `arr` in reverse order.
2. It checks each element in the list to see if it matches `target`.
3. If `target` is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence.
4. If `target` is not found by the end of the iteration, it returns -1.

Considering the return postconditions and the code:

- The code correctly handles the case where `target` is found and returns its index.
- The code also correctly handles the case where `target` is not found and returns -1.

However, the annotations mention several specific postconditions that are not directly reflected in the code. For example, the annotations suggest that the function might return `len(arr) - 1` or `len(arr) - 2` under certain conditions, but these are not actually implemented in the code. The code only returns -1 when the target is not found.

Thus, the functionality of the function is accurately summarized by what the code actually does.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` if it is found; otherwise, it returns -1.**
