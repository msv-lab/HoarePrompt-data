According to the code, the loop iterates from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `target`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 and must still be within the bounds of the list. Since `i` was `len(arr) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, decrementing it by 1 would make `i` equal to `len(arr) - 2`.

Therefore, the new state for the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is `len(arr) - 2`
- `arr` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order
- `arr[i]` (which is now `arr[len(arr) - 2]`) is not equal to `target`

State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `target`**
