Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` rounds each number in the given list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function processes the input list as expected, rounding each element, calculating the sum, and then performing the multiplication. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as intended. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
