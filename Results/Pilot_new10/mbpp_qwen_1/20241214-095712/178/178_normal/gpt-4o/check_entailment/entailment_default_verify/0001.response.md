Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list using the `round()` function, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function handles the expected input (a list of numbers) and performs the required operations accurately. The function has been tested with various inputs, and the provided assertions demonstrate its correctness. There are no indications from the output hints or the problem description that suggest the function fails for any other valid inputs.
