Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list using the `round()` function, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The provided assertions test the function with various inputs, and it passes all of them, indicating that the function works as intended. The annotations confirm that the function processes a list of floating-point or integer numbers, rounds each number, calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the length of the list. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
