Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list and calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers, then multiplies it by the length of the list. The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected, and the annotations accurately describe the state of the program at different points. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
