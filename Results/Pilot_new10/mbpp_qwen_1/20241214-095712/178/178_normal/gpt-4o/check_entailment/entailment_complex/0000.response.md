Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to round every number in a given list and then print the total sum of these rounded numbers multiplied by the length of the list.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input.
   - It uses a list comprehension to round each number in the list to the nearest integer.
   - It calculates the sum of these rounded numbers.
   - It multiplies this sum by the length of the input list.
   - Finally, it returns the result.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions check the function with different lists of numbers and confirm that the output matches the expected results:
     - `func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5])` should return `243`.
     - `func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29])` should return `345`.
     - `func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2])` should return `513`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The rounding and summing operations are correctly performed.
   - The multiplication by the length of the list is also correctly implemented.
   - The function handles both floating-point and integer numbers correctly.

Since the function `func_1` meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and passes all the provided test cases, the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
