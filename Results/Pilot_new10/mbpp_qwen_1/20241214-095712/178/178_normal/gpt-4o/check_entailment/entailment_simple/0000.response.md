Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers (which can be either integers or floating-point numbers), rounds each number to the nearest integer using the `round()` function, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list. The function then returns the result.

The program meets the requirements because:
1. It rounds each number in the list.
2. It calculates the sum of these rounded numbers.
3. It multiplies this sum by the length of the list.
4. It returns the final result.

The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
