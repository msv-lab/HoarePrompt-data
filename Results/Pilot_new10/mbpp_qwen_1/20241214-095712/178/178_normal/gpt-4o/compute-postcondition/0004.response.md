The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of floating-point or integer numbers. The function returns the result which is `total_sum * len(numbers)` where `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `rounded_numbers` (assuming `rounded_numbers` is the list obtained by rounding each element in `numbers` to the nearest integer), and `len(numbers)` is the length of the list `numbers`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numbers and return the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the length of the list.
