Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list and calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers. It then multiplies this sum by the length of the list, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
