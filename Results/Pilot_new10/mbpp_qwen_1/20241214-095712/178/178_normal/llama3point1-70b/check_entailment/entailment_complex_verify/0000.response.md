Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both correctly reflect that the function `func_1` takes a list of numbers, rounds each number, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. This matches the problem description perfectly, and there are no logical errors or edge cases mentioned that would invalidate the original assessment.
