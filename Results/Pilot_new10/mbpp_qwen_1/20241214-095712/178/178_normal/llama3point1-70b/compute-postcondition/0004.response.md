Let's analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions step by step.

### Annotated Code Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   def func_1(numbers):
       rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
   ```
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `numbers` as input.
   - It creates a new list `rounded_numbers` where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   ```python
       total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
   ```
   - It calculates the sum of all elements in `rounded_numbers`.

3. **Return Statement**:
   ```python
       return total_sum * len(numbers)
   ```
   - It returns the product of `total_sum` and the length of the original list `numbers`.

4. **Postcondition**:
   - The program returns `total_sum` multiplied by the length of the list `numbers`.

### Return Postconditions
- The function returns the total sum of the rounded values of the elements in the list `numbers`, multiplied by the length of the list.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic

- **Empty List**: If `numbers` is an empty list, `rounded_numbers` will also be an empty list. The sum of an empty list is 0. Therefore, the return value will be `0 * len([])` which is `0`.
- **List of Floats**: The code correctly rounds each float to the nearest integer before summing them.
- **List of Integers**: If all elements in `numbers` are already integers, the rounding step does nothing, and the code still works correctly.

### Summary

Given the code and the annotations, the function `func_1` takes a list of numbers (floats or integers) and returns the sum of the rounded values of those numbers, multiplied by the length of the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the sum of the rounded values of the elements in the list, multiplied by the length of the list.**
