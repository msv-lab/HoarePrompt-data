Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly handles the described behavior for both non-empty and empty lists. 

- If `list1` is not empty, it replaces the last element of `list1` with the entire content of `list2`.
- If `list1` is empty, it updates `list1` to reference the same list object as `list2`, thereby retaining the original contents of `list2`.

Both scenarios match the problem description and the output hints. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case mentioned.
