Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both confirm that the function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`). The function handles both non-empty and empty lists appropriately, and the provided annotations clarify the state of the program after the if-else block, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
