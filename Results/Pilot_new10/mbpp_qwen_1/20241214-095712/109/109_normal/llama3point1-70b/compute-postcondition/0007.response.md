Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`. If `list1` is not empty, it updates `list1` such that its last element is replaced with the entire content of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it updates `list1` to reference the same list object as `list2`, thereby retaining the original contents of `list2`.**
