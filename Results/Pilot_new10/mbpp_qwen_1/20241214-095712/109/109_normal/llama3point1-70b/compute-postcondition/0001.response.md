The code `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. Since `list1` is not empty in the initial state, it has at least one element. After executing the code, the last element of `list1` will be replaced by `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` is updated such that its last element is now equal to `list2`, `list2` retains its original values.**
