Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list where the last element of `list1` is replaced by all elements of `list2`. The implementation using `list1[:-1] + list2` correctly achieves this by removing the last element of `list1` and appending all elements of `list2` to the resulting list. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including lists of different lengths and even edge cases like empty lists. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected in all tested cases. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case mentioned in the problem description.
