Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the XOR operation to find the positions where the two numbers differ. Then, it counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. If exactly one bit position differs, the count will be 1. This approach correctly identifies whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position for all potential cases. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios.
