Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The original assessment is accurate because the function uses the XOR operation to find differing bits and then counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. If the count is exactly 1, it means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The annotations support the original assessment's conclusion that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
