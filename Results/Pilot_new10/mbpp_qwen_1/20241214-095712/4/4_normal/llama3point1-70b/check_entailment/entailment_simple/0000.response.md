Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **XOR Operation**: The expression `num1 ^ num2` computes the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`. If two bits are different, the result will have a '1' at that position; if they are the same, the result will have a '0'.

2. **Binary Representation**: Converting the result of the XOR operation to its binary representation using `bin()` gives a string like `'0b101'`.

3. **Counting '1's**: The method `.count('1')` counts the number of '1's in this binary string. If the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, the result of the XOR operation will have exactly one '1', and the count will be 1.

4. **Returning the Result**: The function returns `True` if the count is exactly 1, indicating that the numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach works for all possible pairs of non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`, as it correctly identifies when their binary representations differ by exactly one bit. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
