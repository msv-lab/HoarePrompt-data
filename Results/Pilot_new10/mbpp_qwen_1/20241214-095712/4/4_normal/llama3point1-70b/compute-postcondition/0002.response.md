The annotated code states that the function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`. It then performs a bitwise XOR operation on these two numbers, counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result, and returns `True` if this count is exactly 1, otherwise it returns `False`. 

Upon reviewing the code, it is clear that the function indeed follows the steps described in the annotations. There are no apparent edge cases or missing logic in the provided code.
