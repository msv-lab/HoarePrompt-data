Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the provided test cases confirm that the function `func_1` correctly checks if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The logic used in the function is sound, and it passes all the given test cases. The annotation explains that the function returns `True` if `xor_result` is a power of 2 (i.e., `xor_result != 0` and `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`), which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
