Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The problem description requires the function to check whether two non-negative integers differ at exactly one bit position. 

The provided function `func_1` achieves this by using the following logic:
1. Compute the XOR of the two integers (`xor_result = a ^ b`).
2. Check if the XOR result is a power of 2 using the condition `xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`.

Let's break down the conditions:
- If the XOR result is zero (`xor_result == 0`), it means both numbers are identical, so they differ at no bit positions.
- If the XOR result is a power of 2, it means the numbers differ at exactly one bit position because a power of 2 has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).

The provided test cases cover various scenarios:
- When `13 ^ 9` results in `4` (binary `100`), which is a power of 2, so it returns `True`.
- When `15 ^ 8` results in `7` (binary `111`), which is not a power of 2, so it returns `False`.
- When `2 ^ 4` results in `6` (binary `110`), which is not a power of 2, so it returns `False`.
- When `2 ^ 3` results in `1` (binary `1`), which is a power of 2, so it returns `True`.
- When `5 ^ 1` results in `4` (binary `100`), which is a power of 2, so it returns `True`.
- When `1 ^ 5` results in `4` (binary `100`), which is a power of 2, so it returns `True`.

All the test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the function correctly checks whether the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.
