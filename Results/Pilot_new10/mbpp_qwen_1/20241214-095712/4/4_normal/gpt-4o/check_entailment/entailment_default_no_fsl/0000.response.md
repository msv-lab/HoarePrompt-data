Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The function uses the XOR operation to find the differing bits and then checks if the result is a power of 2 using the condition `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`. This condition is true if and only if the XOR result has exactly one bit set, which means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. All the test cases provided in the output hints also confirm that the function works correctly for those specific examples.
