Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This is achieved by using the XOR operation to find differing bits and then checking if the result has exactly one bit set. The expression `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` ensures that the result of the XOR operation has only one bit set, which means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. All the provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the function. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
