Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to take a tuple of numbers `(t_1,...,t_{N+1})` and return a new tuple of length `N` where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. 

- The function uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with its successor in the tuple.
- It then uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to create a new tuple containing the products of these pairs.
- This approach handles all cases without issues, including edge cases like tuples with only two elements (where the resulting tuple will be empty).

Since the program works correctly for all tested cases and no counterexample has been found, the program is correct.
