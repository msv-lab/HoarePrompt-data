The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a tuple of integers or floats with a length of N+1, where N is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple `t`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `t` of integers or floats with a length of N+1 and return a tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from `t`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a tuple of integers or floats with a length of N+1, and returns a tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from `t`.**
