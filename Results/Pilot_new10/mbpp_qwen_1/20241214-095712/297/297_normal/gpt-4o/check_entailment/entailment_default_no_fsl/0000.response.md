Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The code handles tuples with a minimum length of 2 and returns an empty tuple for tuples with fewer than 2 elements. All the provided test cases and the general logic of the code ensure that it works correctly for every potential case within the constraints mentioned.
