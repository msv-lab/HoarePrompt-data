Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function handles tuples of different lengths, including the edge case of a tuple with only one element, which returns an empty tuple. The output hints also confirm this functionality, indicating that the function accepts a tuple of integers or floats with a minimum length of 2 and returns a new tuple with the required products, or an empty tuple if the input tuple has fewer than 2 elements. The provided assertions and the problem description align with this behavior, making the original assessment correct.
