Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `t` of numbers (with a length of \(N+1\)) and returns a new tuple of length \(N\) where the \(i\)-th element is the product of \(t_i\) and \(t_{i+1}\). 

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature and Input Validation**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes a single argument `t`, which is a tuple.
   - There is no explicit validation for the type or the length of the tuple, but the problem description implicitly assumes that `t` is a tuple of integers or floats with a length of \(N+1\), where \(N\) is a positive integer. 

2. **Computation of the Result**:
   - The function uses a generator expression inside a `tuple()` constructor to compute the desired output.
   - The generator expression `t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1)` iterates over the indices of the tuple up to `len(t) - 2` (since we want pairs of consecutive elements).
   - For each index `i`, it multiplies the \(i\)-th element by the \((i+1)\)-th element and includes this product in the resulting tuple.

3. **Examples and Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs:
     - `func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))` returns `(5, 35, 56, 80)`.
     - `func_1((2, 4, 5, 6, 7))` returns `(8, 20, 30, 42)`.
     - `func_1((12, 13, 14, 9, 15))` returns `(156, 182, 126, 135)`.
     - `func_1((12,))` returns `()`, which is consistent because there are no consecutive elements to multiply.

Since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all tested cases, the correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
