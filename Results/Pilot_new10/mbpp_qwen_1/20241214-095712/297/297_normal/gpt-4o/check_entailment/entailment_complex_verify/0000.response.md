Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The annotated version of the code further clarifies that the function processes a tuple of integers or floats with a minimum length of 2 and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple. The provided test cases and the logic within the function support this conclusion. The function correctly handles the cases provided and the annotated version aligns with the original assessment, indicating that the function is indeed correct based on the problem description and the given examples.
