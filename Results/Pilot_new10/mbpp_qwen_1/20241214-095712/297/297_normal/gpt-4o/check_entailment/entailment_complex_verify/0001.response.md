Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the behavior of the `func_1` function. The function takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function handles tuples of different lengths, including the edge case of a tuple with only one element, which returns an empty tuple. The provided test cases in the annotations cover various scenarios and confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
