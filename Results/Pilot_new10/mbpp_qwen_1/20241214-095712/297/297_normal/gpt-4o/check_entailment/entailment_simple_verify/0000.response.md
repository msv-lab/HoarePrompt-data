Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of taking a tuple of numbers and returning a tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function processes the input tuple correctly, generating the expected output for the provided test cases. There are no issues or edge cases identified in the annotated version that would indicate the original assessment is incorrect.
