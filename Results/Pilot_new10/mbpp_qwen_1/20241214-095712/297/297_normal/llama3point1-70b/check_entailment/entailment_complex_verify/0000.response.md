Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement by pairing each element with its successor using `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` and then multiplying them. The function returns a tuple of the products of these pairs, which matches the problem description. The annotation also correctly states that the function handles all cases, including edge cases with tuples of only two elements, where the resulting tuple would be empty. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is supported by both the code and the annotations.
