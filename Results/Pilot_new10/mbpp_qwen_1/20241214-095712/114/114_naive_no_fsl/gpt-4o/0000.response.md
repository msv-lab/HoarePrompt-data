Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `count` method of the tuple, which only returns the number of occurrences of the specified element. However, the function signature and docstring imply that it should accept a tuple and an element, but the function definition does not match the expected behavior described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem description asks for a function that counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple, which the given function correctly implements. 

However, the issue lies in the fact that the function does not handle the case where the element is not present in the tuple, and it does not provide a clear error message or return a specific value for such cases. While the provided test cases do not cover this scenario explicitly, the function should still handle it gracefully. For example, if the tuple is `(),` (an empty tuple) and the element is `10`, the function should return `0`.

Since the function does not explicitly handle all potential edge cases, it is not fully robust according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
