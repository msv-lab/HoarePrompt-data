#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and element can be any type of object.
def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
    #The program returns the number of times 'element' appears in tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the number of times the element appears in the tuple.
