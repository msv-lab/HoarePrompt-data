Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the `count` method. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a tuple and an element and returns the number of times the element appears in the tuple. The original assessment incorrectly stated that the function is incorrect due to the use of `tup.count(element)`, which is appropriate for tuples in Python. The provided test cases validate this behavior, and there is no indication that the function should only work with other iterable types. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
