Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the original function `func_1` clearly show that the function correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. Given that the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., `tup` is a tuple and `elem` is a hashable object), the function meets the requirements of the problem description without any issues.
