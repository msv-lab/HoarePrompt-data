Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both accurately reflect the functionality of the provided Python function. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. The annotation specifies that `tup` is a tuple and `elem` is a hashable object, which aligns with the behavior of the `count` method. The function behaves as expected for all valid inputs, making the original assessment of correctness accurate.
