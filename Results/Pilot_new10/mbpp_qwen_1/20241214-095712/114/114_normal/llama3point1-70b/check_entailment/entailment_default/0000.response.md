Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the number of times `elem` appears in `tup` using the built-in `count` method of tuples. The code handles all potential cases, including cases where the element is not present in the tuple, and it works correctly for any hashable element and tuple. Therefore, the code satisfies the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
