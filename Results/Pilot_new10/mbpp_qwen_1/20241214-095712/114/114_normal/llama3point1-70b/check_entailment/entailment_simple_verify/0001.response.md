Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment are consistent. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. Given the problem description and the assumption that the input is always valid (i.e., `tup` is always a tuple and `elem` is always a hashable object), the program meets the requirements and behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
