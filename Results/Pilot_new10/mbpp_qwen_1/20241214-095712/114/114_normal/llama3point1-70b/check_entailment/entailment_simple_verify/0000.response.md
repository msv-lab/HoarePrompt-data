Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. Given that the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., `tup` is a tuple and `elem` is a hashable object), the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
