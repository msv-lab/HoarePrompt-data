Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a hashable object `elem`, and returns the number of times `elem` appears in `tup`.** 

This summary accurately reflects the functionality of the function based on the code. The function simply uses the `count` method of the tuple to determine how many times the specified element `elem` appears within the tuple `tup`. There are no additional functionalities or edge cases to consider as the `count` method handles all necessary cases.
