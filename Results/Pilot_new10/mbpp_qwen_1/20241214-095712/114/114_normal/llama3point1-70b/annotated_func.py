#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and elem is a hashable object.
def func_1(tup, elem):
    return tup.count(elem)
    #`The program returns the number of times 'elem' appears in the tuple 'tup'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a hashable object `elem`, and returns the number of times `elem` appears in `tup`.
