Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program uses `tup.count(element)` to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. However, the problem description does not specify that the function should only handle tuples. The function signature only mentions a tuple and an element, but the test cases provided use tuples, which means the function is correctly implemented according to the given examples. 

However, if the function were to be used with other iterable types (like lists or strings), the behavior might differ because `count` is a method specific to sequences like lists and strings, and tuples in Python do not have a `count` method. For tuples, the count operation would be performed using the same logic, but this behavior is not explicitly checked in the provided test cases.

Since the problem description does not specify that the function should only work with tuples and no other iterable types, we cannot conclude that the function is incorrect based solely on this information. But if the function is expected to work with only tuples, then the implementation is incorrect because it relies on a method that is not available for tuples directly. Given the provided examples and the problem description, the function should be correct. Therefore, the provided solution is correct based on the given examples, but if the function is expected to work with only tuples, it should be noted that the function name and docstring should clearly specify this.
