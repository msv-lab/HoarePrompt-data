Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements a recursive function to flatten a nested list. It checks each item in the input list, and if the item is a list itself, it recursively calls `func_1` on that item. Otherwise, it appends the item directly to the `flat_list`. This ensures that all nested lists are flattened properly, regardless of their depth. The examples given in the problem description and the assert statements also confirm that the function works as expected for various cases.
