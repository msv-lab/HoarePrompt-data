Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both correctly describe the behavior of the `func_1` function. The function indeed flattens a nested list structure by recursively processing each element, handling both integers and nested lists. The provided test cases validate that the function works as expected for various inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
