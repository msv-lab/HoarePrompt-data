Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively handling nested lists. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list containing integers or other lists at any depth and returns a flattened list. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness for various inputs, including different depths of nesting and repeated elements. Therefore, the original assessment is correct as the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the output hints.
