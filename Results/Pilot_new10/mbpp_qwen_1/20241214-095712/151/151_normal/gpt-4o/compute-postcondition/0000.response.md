The code initializes an empty list named `flat_list`. This does not affect the value of `nested_list`, which remains as a list that may contain integers or other lists. The only new information is that `flat_list` now exists and is an empty list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level); `flat_list` is an empty list**
