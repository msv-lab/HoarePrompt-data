Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It aims to flatten a nested list structure into a single, flat list. Here's why it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Base Case Handling**: When an element in `nested_list` is not a list (`type(i) != list`), it is directly appended to `flat_list`. This ensures all non-list elements are included in the final result.
2. **Recursive Case Handling**: When an element in `nested_list` is a list (`type(i) == list`), the function calls itself (`func_1(i)`) to process the nested list, effectively flattening it. The result of this recursive call is then extended into `flat_list` using `extend()`. This ensures that the nested structure is handled recursively.
3. **Final Result**: After the for loop processes all elements in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains all elements from the original nested list structure, flattened to a single list.

Given these points, the function `func_1` correctly flattens any given nested list structure, thus meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
