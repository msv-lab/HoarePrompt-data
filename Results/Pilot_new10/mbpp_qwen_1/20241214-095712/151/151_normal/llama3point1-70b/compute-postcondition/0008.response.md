The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` affects the `flat_list` variable. It extends `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(i)`. However, the function `func_1` and the value of `i` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact updated value of `flat_list`. We know that `nested_list` is a non-empty list and `flat_list` is an empty list extended by either the flattened version of the first element of the original `nested_list` if the first element was a list, or the first element itself if it was not a list.

Since `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values, but we can say that `flat_list` is extended by `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list, `flat_list` is an empty list extended by `func_1(i)`.**
