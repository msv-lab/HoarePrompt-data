`flat_list` has its `append` method called with `i` as the argument. This means that the value of `i` is added to the end of `flat_list`. The first element of `nested_list` is not directly mentioned in the code, but it is stated that if it was a list, it would be flattened and added to `flat_list`, otherwise, it would be added directly. Since the code only appends `i` to `flat_list`, the only change is to `flat_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list (excluding the first element), `flat_list` contains the value of `i` appended to it.**
