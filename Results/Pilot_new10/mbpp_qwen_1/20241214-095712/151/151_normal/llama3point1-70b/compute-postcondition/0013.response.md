The code `flat_list.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the `flat_list`. Since `i` is the first element of `nested_list` (from the initial state), `flat_list` will get its first element appended. 

Given the initial state:
- `nested_list` is a non-empty list.
- `flat_list` contains the flattened version of the previous first element if it was a list.

After the code executes, the first element of `nested_list` is appended to `flat_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list; `flat_list` is the original flattened version of the previous first element plus the first element of `nested_list`.**
