Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the Lucas sequence for the test cases given (`func_1(9) == 76`, `func_1(4) == 7`, `func_1(3) == 4`). However, the function does not handle negative inputs or non-integer inputs. According to the problem description, there is no explicit mention of how the function should behave with such inputs, but typically, a function to find the n'th Lucas number should either raise an error or return a specific value for such cases. For example:

- If `n` is a negative integer, the function should ideally raise an error or return a specific value indicating that the input is invalid.
- If `n` is not an integer, the function should also ideally raise an error or return a specific value indicating that the input is invalid.

Since the function does not handle these cases, it can be considered incorrect. Here is an example of a negative input case that the function does not handle:

```python
assert func_1(-1) == ValueError  # or some specific value indicating invalid input
```

To make the function fully correct, it should include input validation:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```
