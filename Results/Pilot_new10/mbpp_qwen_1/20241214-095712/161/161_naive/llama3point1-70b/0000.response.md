Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic for finding the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is defined as follows: L(0) = 2, L(1) = 1, and L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1. The program initializes the first two values of the sequence and then iteratively computes the subsequent values up to the n-th term. Given the base cases and the iterative update rule, the program will produce the correct result for any non-negative integer n. Therefore, there are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the problem description.
