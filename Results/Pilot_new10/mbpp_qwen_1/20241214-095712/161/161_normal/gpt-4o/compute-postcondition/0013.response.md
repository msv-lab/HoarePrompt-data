Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the nth Fibonacci number where the first Fibonacci number is 1 and the second is 2, `b` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number where the first Fibonacci number is 1 and the second is 2.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0 and 1.
   - `a` is 2.
   - `b` is 1.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(2, n + 1):
       a, b = b, a + b
   ```
   This loop iteratively updates `a` and `b` using the Fibonacci sequence rule. Specifically:
   - `a` and `b` start as the first and second Fibonacci numbers respectively (1 and 2).
   - In each iteration, `a` is updated to the value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`.

3. **Observation from Example Outputs**:
   - After 1 iteration: `a` is 3, `b` is 2.
   - After 2 iterations: `a` is 2, `b` is 5.
   - After 3 iterations: `a` is 7, `b` is 2.

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Each time the loop runs, `a` becomes the next Fibonacci number, and `b` becomes the previous Fibonacci number.
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n < 2`), then `a` remains 2 and `b` remains 1.

5. **Final Output State**:
   - Since `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, `a` will always be the nth Fibonacci number starting from 2 (which is the 3rd Fibonacci number) and `b` will be the (n-1)th Fibonacci number starting from 1 (which is the 2nd Fibonacci number).

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the nth Fibonacci number where the first Fibonacci number is 1 and the second is 2, and `b` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number where the first Fibonacci number is 1 and the second is 2.
