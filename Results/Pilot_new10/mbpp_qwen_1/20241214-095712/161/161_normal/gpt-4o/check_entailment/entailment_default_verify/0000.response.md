Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle negative inputs, even though the problem description does not specifically require it. The output hints confirm that the function only handles non-negative integers correctly, and it correctly returns the expected Lucas numbers for the given test cases. However, since the problem description implies the function should work for all non-negative integers, and the program does not account for negative inputs, it is considered incorrect.
