Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code implements a function that returns the (n-1)th Fibonacci number instead of the nth Lucas number. According to the problem description, the nth Lucas number is defined as follows:
- \(L(0) = 2\)
- \(L(1) = 1\)
- For \(n > 1\), \(L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\)

However, the code is implementing the Fibonacci sequence where:
- \(F(0) = 0\)
- \(F(1) = 1\)
- For \(n > 1\), \(F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\)

To correctly implement the Lucas sequence, the initial values should be \(L(0) = 2\) and \(L(1) = 1\), which is correct in the code. But the loop updates the variables as if they were Fibonacci numbers, which means the values returned are not the correct Lucas numbers. For example, \(L(2) = 3\) (since \(L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2\)), but the code returns 1 for \(n=2\).

The assertions provided in the test cases (e.g., `func_1(9) == 76`, `func_1(4) == 7`, `func_1(3) == 4`) suggest that the function is returning Fibonacci numbers instead of Lucas numbers. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
