You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the Lucas sequence for the test cases given (`func_1(9) == 76`, `func_1(4) == 7`, `func_1(3) == 4`). However, the function does not handle negative inputs or non-integer inputs. According to the problem description, there is no explicit mention of how the function should behave with such inputs, but typically, a function to find the n'th Lucas number should either raise an error or return a specific value for such cases. For example:

- If `n` is a negative integer, the function should ideally raise an error or return a specific value indicating that the input is invalid.
- If `n` is not an integer, the function should also ideally raise an error or return a specific value indicating that the input is invalid.

Since the function does not handle these cases, it can be considered incorrect. Here is an example of a negative input case that the function does not handle:

```python
assert func_1(-1) == ValueError  # or some specific value indicating invalid input
```

To make the function fully correct, it should include input validation:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the nth Fibonacci number where the first Fibonacci number is 1 and the second is 2, `b` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number where the first Fibonacci number is 1 and the second is 2.
            return b
            #`b`, which is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number where the first Fibonacci number is 1 and the second is 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 2 if `n` is 0, 1 if `n` is 1, and the (n-1)th Fibonacci number (where the first Fibonacci number is 1 and the second is 2) for any other non-negative integer `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
