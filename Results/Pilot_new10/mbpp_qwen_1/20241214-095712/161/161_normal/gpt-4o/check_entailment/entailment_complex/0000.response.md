Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number. However, the provided program implements a function that computes the n-th Fibonacci number with specific initial values (2 for the first number and 1 for the second). 

- The 0th Lucas number is 2.
- The 1st Lucas number is 1.
- For n > 1, the n-th Lucas number is the sum of the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Lucas numbers.

However, the program provided calculates the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number with initial values 1 and 2. While the initial values match those for the Lucas sequence, the sequence generated by the program is actually the Fibonacci sequence shifted by one position. Specifically:
- The 0th Fibonacci number is 0.
- The 1st Fibonacci number is 1.
- For n > 1, the n-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Fibonacci numbers.

Thus, the program does not generate the n-th Lucas number but rather the n-th Fibonacci number with specific initial conditions. This discrepancy means the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
