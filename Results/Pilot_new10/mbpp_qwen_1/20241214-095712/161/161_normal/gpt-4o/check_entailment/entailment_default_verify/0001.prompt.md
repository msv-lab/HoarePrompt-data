You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the Lucas sequence for the test cases given (`func_1(9) == 76`, `func_1(4) == 7`, `func_1(3) == 4`). However, the function does not handle negative inputs or non-integer inputs. According to the problem description, there is no explicit mention of how the function should behave with such inputs, but typically, a function to find the n'th Lucas number should either raise an error or return a specific value for such cases. For example:

- If `n` is a negative integer, the function should ideally raise an error or return a specific value indicating that the input is invalid.
- If `n` is not an integer, the function should also ideally raise an error or return a specific value indicating that the input is invalid.

Since the function does not handle these cases, it can be considered incorrect. Here is an example of a negative input case that the function does not handle:

```python
assert func_1(-1) == ValueError  # or some specific value indicating invalid input
```

To make the function fully correct, it should include input validation:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 2 if `n` is 0, 1 if `n` is 1, and the (n-1)th Fibonacci number (where the first Fibonacci number is 1 and the second is 2) for any other non-negative integer `n`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
