According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, and `n` must be at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3. This is because the loop starts at 2 and goes up to `n`. If `n` is 2, the loop would have already completed its iterations. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `n` must be increased to 3.

State: **`a` is 1, `b` is 3, `n` must be at least 3**
