The code initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the values 2 and 1, respectively. The initial value of `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1. Since no operations modify `n`, its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 1**
