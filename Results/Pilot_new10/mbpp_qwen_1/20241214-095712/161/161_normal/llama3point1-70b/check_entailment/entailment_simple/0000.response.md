Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the Lucas sequence as described in the problem statement. The problem description asks to find the n-th Lucas number, but the implementation provided calculates the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number instead.

### Why It Is Incorrect:
- **Base Cases Mismatch:** 
  - For \( n = 0 \), the function returns 2, which is correct for the 0-th Lucas number (\( L_0 = 2 \)).
  - For \( n = 1 \), the function returns 1, which is correct for the 1-st Lucas number (\( L_1 = 1 \)).
  
- **Calculation Logic Error:**
  - The code uses two variables \( a \) and \( b \) initialized as 2 and 1, respectively. These values correspond to the first two Lucas numbers \( L_0 \) and \( L_1 \).
  - However, the loop then iterates from 2 to \( n+1 \) and updates \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a \) becomes the next Lucas number and \( b \) becomes the next one. Therefore, at the end of the loop, \( b \) will be the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number, not the n-th Lucas number.
  
### Correct Implementation:
To correctly calculate the n-th Lucas number, the loop should iterate from 0 to \( n-1 \) and use the initial values \( L_0 = 2 \) and \( L_1 = 1 \).

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return a
```

In this corrected version, `a` will hold the n-th Lucas number after the loop completes.
