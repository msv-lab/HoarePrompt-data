Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the logic for finding the n-th Lucas number. However, based on the output hints, the program actually returns the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number for n â‰¥ 2, which is incorrect according to the definition of the Lucas sequence. The Lucas sequence is defined as L(0) = 2, L(1) = 1, and L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1. The program should return the n-th Lucas number, not the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
