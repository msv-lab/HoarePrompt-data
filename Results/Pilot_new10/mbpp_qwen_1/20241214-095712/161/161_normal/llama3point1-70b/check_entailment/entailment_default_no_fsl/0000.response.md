Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks for the n'th Lucas number, but the provided code actually returns the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number. This is evident from the output hints which state that for `n >= 2`, the function returns the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number, not the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

However, the code computes:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = F(n+2) for n > 1

Where F(n) is the n-th Fibonacci number. Since the Lucas numbers and Fibonacci numbers are different sequences, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
