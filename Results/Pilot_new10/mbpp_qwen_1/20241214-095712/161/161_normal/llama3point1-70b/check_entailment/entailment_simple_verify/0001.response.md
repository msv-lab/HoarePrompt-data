Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the n'th Lucas number. The function handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, and for other values of `n`, it correctly uses iterative updates to compute the Lucas sequence. The annotations clearly show that after the for loop, `a` and `b` hold the correct values corresponding to the Lucas sequence. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.
