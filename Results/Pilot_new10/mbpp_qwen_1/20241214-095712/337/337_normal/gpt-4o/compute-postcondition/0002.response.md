Let's break down the provided annotated code and return postconditions step by step to ensure we capture all potential cases and accurately summarize the functionality of the function.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

```python
# State of the program right before the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
    # The program returns the sum of unique integers from the list 'lst'
# Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers, and returns the sum of unique integers from the list.
```

### Key Points from the Annotated Code:
1. **Input Parameter**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
2. **Output**: The function returns the sum of unique elements in the list `lst`.
3. **Process**:
   - Convert the list `lst` to a set using `set(lst)`. This removes any duplicate elements from the list.
   - Use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the unique elements in the set.

### Return Postconditions:
- The function returns the sum of unique integers from the list `lst`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Empty List**: If the input list `lst` is empty, the set conversion will also result in an empty set, and the sum of an empty set is 0.
- **List with Duplicates**: If the list contains duplicate elements, the set will remove these duplicates, and the function will return the sum of the unique elements.
- **List with Unique Elements**: If the list already contains only unique elements, the set conversion will not change anything, and the function will return the sum of these elements.

### Summary of Functionality:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of the unique integers present in the list. This includes handling cases where the list is empty, contains duplicates, or already consists of unique elements.

### Final Summary:
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of unique integers from the list, handling cases where the list is empty, contains duplicates, or already consists of unique elements.**
