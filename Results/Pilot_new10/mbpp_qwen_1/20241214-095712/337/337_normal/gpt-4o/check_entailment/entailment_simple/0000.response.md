Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in the list. This is achieved by converting the list to a set, which inherently removes duplicate elements, and then using the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the remaining unique elements. 

The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- In the first test case, the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]` has unique elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, and their sum is `21`.
- In the second test case, the input `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]` has unique elements `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 45]`, and their sum is `71`.
- In the third test case, the input `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]` has unique elements `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2]`, and their sum is `78`.

Since the function consistently returns the correct sum of unique elements for the given test cases, it adheres to the problem description and is therefore correct.
