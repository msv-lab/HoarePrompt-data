Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly explains that the function `func_1` takes a list of integers and returns the sum of unique integers from the list. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in the given lists. The annotated version aligns with the provided assertions and the functionality described in the problem statement. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that would cause the program to fail for other inputs under the assumption of valid input.
