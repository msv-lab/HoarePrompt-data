Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly removes duplicates from the input list using the `set` data structure and then calculates the sum of the unique elements. The provided test cases validate the function for different scenarios, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations.
