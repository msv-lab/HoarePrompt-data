Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list by converting the list to a set to remove duplicates and then summing the unique elements. The output hints confirm that the function handles various cases, including empty lists and lists with duplicates, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is appropriate.
