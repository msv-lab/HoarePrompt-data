Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The generator expression filters out elements that appear more than once using `lst.count(i) == 1`, and the `sum` function adds up the remaining unique elements. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning 0 if the list is empty or all elements are duplicates. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or output hints that this program fails to handle correctly.
