Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list. The generator expression iterates over each element in the list and includes only those elements that appear exactly once, as determined by the condition `lst.count(i) == 1`. The output hints confirm that the function returns the sum of all unique integers in the list, and returns 0 if the list is empty or all elements are duplicates. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, and there are no edge cases or input scenarios mentioned in the output hints that suggest the function behaves incorrectly.
