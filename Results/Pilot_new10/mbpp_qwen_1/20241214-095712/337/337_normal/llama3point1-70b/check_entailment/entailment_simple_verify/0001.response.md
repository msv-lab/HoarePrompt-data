Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original program align with the problem description, which is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by using a generator expression to sum only those elements that appear exactly once in the list (`lst.count(i) == 1`). The annotation accurately describes the state of the program, confirming that the function works as intended under the given conditions. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
