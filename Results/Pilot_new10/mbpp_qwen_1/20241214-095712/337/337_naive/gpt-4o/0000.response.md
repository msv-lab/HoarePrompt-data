Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses `sum(set(lst))` to calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in the list. This approach works because converting the list to a set removes all duplicate elements, and then summing the set gives the sum of unique elements. 

Given the assertions:
- For `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the unique elements are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and their sum is `21`.
- For `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]`, the unique elements are `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 45]` and their sum is `71`.
- For `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]`, the unique elements are `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2]` and their sum is `78`.

The program handles the provided examples correctly and seems to handle the general case of finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. There are no obvious edge cases or potential errors in the logic that would cause the program to fail for other inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
