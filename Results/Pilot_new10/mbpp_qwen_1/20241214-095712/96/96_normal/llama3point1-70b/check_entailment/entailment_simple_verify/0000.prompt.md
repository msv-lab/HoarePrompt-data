You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set((type(x) for x in tup))) == 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It uses a set to store the unique types of elements in the tuple and checks if the size of this set is 1. This approach is correct because:

- It iterates through each element in the tuple once, determining its type using `type(x)`.
- It stores these types in a set, which automatically removes duplicates.
- If the set contains only one type, it means all elements in the tuple have the same data type.

This logic covers all potential cases where the tuple might contain elements of different or the same data types. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where this program would fail based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all elements in the tuple 'tup' are of the same type, otherwise it returns False


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
