Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The function `func_1` indeed checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type by converting each element to its type, storing these types in a set, and checking if the length of the set is 1. The annotation correctly describes the behavior of the function, and the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description.
