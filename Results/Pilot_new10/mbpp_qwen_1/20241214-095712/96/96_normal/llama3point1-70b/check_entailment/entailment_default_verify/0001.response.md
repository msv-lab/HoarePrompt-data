Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The function uses a set to store the unique types of elements in the tuple. If all elements have the same type, the length of the set will be 1. The output hints confirm that the function returns `True` if all elements in the tuple are of the same type and `False` otherwise. Since the function behaves as expected and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description, the original assessment is correct.
