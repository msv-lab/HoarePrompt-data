Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(tup)` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The function checks whether all elements in the input tuple `tup` are of the same data type. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Type Conversion and Uniqueness Check**: 
   - The expression `set(type(x) for x in tup)` converts each element `x` in the tuple `tup` to its corresponding type (e.g., `int`, `str`, `float`) and then creates a set from these types. A set inherently contains unique elements, so if all elements in the tuple are of the same type, the set will contain exactly one type.
   - The length of this set (`len(set(...))`) is checked against `1`. If the length is `1`, it means all elements in the tuple have the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the tuple is empty, the function still works correctly because an empty set has a length of `0`, which is not equal to `1`, so it returns `False` as expected.
   - The function handles tuples with elements of different types correctly, returning `False` when there are multiple distinct types.

3. **Comprehensive Approach**:
   - The approach leverages the properties of sets to efficiently check for uniformity in the types of elements, ensuring the function works consistently across various inputs.

Thus, the function `func_1` always meets the requirements specified in the problem description, making it correct.
