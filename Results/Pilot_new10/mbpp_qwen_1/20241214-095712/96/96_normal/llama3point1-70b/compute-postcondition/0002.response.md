Let's analyze the provided code step by step to ensure we capture all potential cases and accurately summarize the functionality.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1
    # The program returns True if all elements in the tuple 'tup' are of the same type, otherwise it returns False
```

### Return Postconditions:
The function returns `True` if all elements in the tuple `tup` are of the same type, otherwise it returns `False`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Parameter**: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple.
2. **Code Execution**:
   - The expression `type(x) for x in tup` generates a generator expression that yields the type of each element `x` in the tuple `tup`.
   - The `set()` function is used to remove duplicates from the types of the elements in the tuple.
   - The `len()` function checks if the length of this set is 1. If it is 1, it means all elements in the tuple are of the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Empty Tuple**: If `tup` is an empty tuple, the set of types would also be empty, and `len(set())` would be 0. This matches the condition `len(set()) == 1` because an empty set has a length of 0.
- **Single Element Tuple**: If `tup` contains only one element, the set of types would contain exactly one type, satisfying the condition `len(set()) == 1`.
- **Mixed Types**: If `tup` contains elements of different types, the set of types would have more than one element, and `len(set())` would be greater than 1, resulting in `False`.

### Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple are of the same type. It handles cases where the tuple is empty, contains only one element, or has mixed types appropriately.

### Functionality:
**The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple are of the same type, otherwise it returns `False`.**
