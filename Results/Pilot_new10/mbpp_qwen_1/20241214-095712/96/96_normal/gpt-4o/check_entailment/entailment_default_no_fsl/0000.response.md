Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It handles the case where the tuple is empty by returning `True`, which is correct according to the problem description. The code also iterates through the tuple, comparing the type of each element to the type of the first element, and returns `False` if any element has a different type. This logic ensures that the function behaves as described for all potential cases. Therefore, the code is correct.
