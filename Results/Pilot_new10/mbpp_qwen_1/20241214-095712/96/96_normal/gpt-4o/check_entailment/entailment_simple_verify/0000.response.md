Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the original assessment. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function behaves as expected. The original assessment is accurate because the function works correctly for the provided test cases and handles the edge case of an empty tuple.
