Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It handles an empty tuple correctly by returning `True`. For non-empty tuples, it determines the data type of the first element and then checks if all other elements match this type. The function works as expected for the given test cases and there doesn't seem to be any edge case that would cause it to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
