`total` is assigned the value of `total + (n % 10)`. Given the initial state where `n` is `n_original // 10` and `total` is `n_original % 10`, we can substitute these values into the equation.

Since `n = n_original // 10`, `n % 10` would be the last digit of `n`, which is the same as the last digit of `n_original // 10`. 

And since `total = n_original % 10`, `total` already holds the last digit of `n_original`.

Thus, adding `n % 10` to `total` will effectively add the last digit of `n_original // 10` to `total`, which is the same as the last digit of `n_original`.

Therefore, the new value of `total` will be the last digit of `n_original` plus itself, which means `total` doubles the last digit of `n_original`.

Output State: **`n` is `n_original // 10`, `total` is `2 * (n_original % 10)`, `n_original` must be greater than 0**
