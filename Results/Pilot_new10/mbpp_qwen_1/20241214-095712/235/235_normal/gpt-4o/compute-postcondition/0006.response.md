The code `n //= 10` divides `n` by 10 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. Initially, `n` is `n_original // 10`, so after executing the code, `n` will be updated to `(n_original // 10) // 10`, which simplifies to `n_original // 100`.

The variables `total` and `n_original` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `n_original // 100`, `total` is `2 * (n_original % 10)`, `n_original` must be greater than 0**
