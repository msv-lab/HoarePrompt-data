Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer as described in the problem statement. The assertions given cover various test cases, including a three-digit number (`345`), a two-digit number (`12`), and a two-digit number with a higher sum (`97`). The output hints also confirm that the function accepts a non-negative integer and returns the sum of its digits. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
