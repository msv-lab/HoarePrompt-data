Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function iterates through each digit of the input number by using the modulus operator `%` to get the last digit and integer division `//` to remove the last digit. This process continues until the number is reduced to 0. The test cases given (`func_1(345) == 12`, `func_1(12) == 3`, `func_1(97) == 16`) all pass, and based on the problem description and the output hints, the function works correctly for the given inputs. Since the function handles the tested cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement, it is reasonable to conclude that the function is correct for every potential case.
