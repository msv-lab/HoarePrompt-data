You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. This approach handles all non-negative integers correctly, including edge cases like 0, single-digit numbers, and multi-digit numbers. There doesn't appear to be any scenario where this function would fail based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of digits of the non-negative integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:Let's analyze the provided code and annotations step by step:

1. The function `func_1` takes a parameter `n`, which is specified to be a non-negative integer.
2. The return statement in the function uses a generator expression to convert each digit of `n` to an integer and sums them up.

From the code, we can see that:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- The function converts `n` to a string to iterate over each character (digit).
- Each character is converted to an integer.
- The integers are summed up and returned.

Given the annotations and the code, the function correctly performs the described operation without any missing functionality or edge cases that need special mention.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

**The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits.**

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
