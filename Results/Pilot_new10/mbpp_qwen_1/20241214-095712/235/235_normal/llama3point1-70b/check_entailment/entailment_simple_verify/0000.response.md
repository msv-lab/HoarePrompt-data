Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both accurately describe the functionality of the function `func_1`. The function correctly converts a non-negative integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. The annotations and the code clearly indicate that the function works as intended for all non-negative integers, including edge cases like 0 and single-digit numbers. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
