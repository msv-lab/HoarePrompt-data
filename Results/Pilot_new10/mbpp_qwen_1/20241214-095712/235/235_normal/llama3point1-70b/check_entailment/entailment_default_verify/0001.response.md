Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The output hints and the given examples (e.g., `n = 0`, `n = 123`, and `n = 9876543210`) confirm that the function works as expected for these cases. Since the problem description only requires handling non-negative integers and no additional constraints or edge cases were specified, the original assessment is accurate. The function handles all valid inputs correctly within the scope of the problem description.
