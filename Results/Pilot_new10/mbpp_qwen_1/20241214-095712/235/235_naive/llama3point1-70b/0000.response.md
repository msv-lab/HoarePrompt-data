Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. This approach handles all non-negative integers correctly, including edge cases like 0, single-digit numbers, and multi-digit numbers. There doesn't appear to be any scenario where this function would fail based on the problem description.
