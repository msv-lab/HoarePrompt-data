Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks whether every odd index in the given list `lst` contains an odd number. The program iterates through the list and checks if the number at each odd index is even. If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`.

Given the problem description, the program correctly implements the logic required. It checks all elements at odd indices and ensures they are odd. There are no edge cases or inputs where this program would fail to meet the requirements described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
