#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a non-empty list of integers, and the function returns `None` if no condition `i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0` is met during the loop execution. Otherwise, the function returns `False` if the condition is ever met at any point during the loop execution.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` of integers and returns `True` if no element at an odd index is even. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
