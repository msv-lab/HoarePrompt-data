Let's analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Parameters and Input:**
   - The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers.

2. **Function Execution Flow:**
   - The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the indices of the list `lst`.
   - For each index `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - `i % 2 != 0`: Checks if the index `i` is odd.
     - `lst[i] % 2 == 0`: Checks if the element at index `i` is even.

3. **Return Statements:**
   - If both conditions (`i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0`) are met at any point during the loop, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without meeting the condition, the function returns `True`.

4. **Postconditions and Edge Cases:**
   - The return postconditions provided are all indicating `False`, but this seems incorrect because the loop can also return `True` if no elements meet the specified condition.
   - The loop only returns `False` if it finds an odd index with an even element, and `True` if no such pair is found.

### Summary of Functionality:

The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers. It iterates through the list and checks if there is any odd-indexed element that is even. If such an element is found, it returns `False`. If no such element is found throughout the entire list, it returns `True`.

### Final Summary:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` of integers and returns `True` if no element at an odd index is even. Otherwise, it returns `False`.**
