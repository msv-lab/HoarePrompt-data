Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list `lst` contains an odd number. Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:

1. **Iterate Through the List**: The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through each index `i` of the list `lst`.

2. **Check Condition**: For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`) and if the element at that index is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are met for any index, the function immediately returns `False`.

3. **Return True if No Violation**: If the loop completes without finding any index `i` that satisfies `i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0`, the function returns `True`.

This logic ensures that the function adheres to the requirement that every odd index must contain an odd number. If any odd index contains an even number, the function will correctly return `False`. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
