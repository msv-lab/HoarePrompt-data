Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the explanation provided in the original assessment clearly indicate that the function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in the given list `lst` contains an odd number. The function correctly iterates through the list and checks if the number at each odd index is even. If it finds an even number at any odd index, it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`. This matches the problem description perfectly, and the annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected under all valid input conditions.
