Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list `lst` contains an odd number. The annotations also correctly describe the state of the program. The program iterates through the list, and if it finds an even number at any odd index, it returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding such a case, it returns `True`. The annotations indicate that the function returns `None` if no condition is met (which is implied as returning `True`), and returns `False` if the condition is ever met. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
