Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through the list and checks if every odd index contains an odd number. The condition `if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:` ensures that only elements at odd indices are checked, and those elements must be even for the function to return `False`. Since the function returns `True` only if no element at an odd index is even, it meets the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
