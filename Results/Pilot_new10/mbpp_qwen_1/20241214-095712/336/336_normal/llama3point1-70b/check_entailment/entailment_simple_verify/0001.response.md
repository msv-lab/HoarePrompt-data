Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is correct because it checks if every odd index contains an odd number. However, the annotated version of the code reveals that the function actually returns `True` only if no even number is found at an odd index. This means that the function does not correctly implement the requirement to check if every odd index contains an odd number; instead, it returns `True` as long as there is at least one odd index with an odd number. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate. The function should return `False` if there is any odd index with an even number, but it currently returns `True` in that case.
