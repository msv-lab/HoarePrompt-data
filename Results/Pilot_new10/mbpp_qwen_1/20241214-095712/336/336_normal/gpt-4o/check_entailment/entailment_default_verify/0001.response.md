Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The output hints correctly summarize the functionality of the function, indicating that it returns `False` if any element at an odd index is even, and `True` otherwise. The assertions provided validate this behavior, and there are no cases mentioned in the output hints that suggest the function is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
