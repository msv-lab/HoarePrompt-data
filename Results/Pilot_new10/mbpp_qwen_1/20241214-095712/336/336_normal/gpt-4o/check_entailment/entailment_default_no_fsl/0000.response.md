Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`. This matches the problem description and the provided assertions confirm its correctness for the given test cases. Therefore, the code works as expected for every potential case within the problem constraints.
