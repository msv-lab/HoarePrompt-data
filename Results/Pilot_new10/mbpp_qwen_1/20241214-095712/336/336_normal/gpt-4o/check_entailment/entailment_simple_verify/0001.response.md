Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after completing the iteration. The provided assertions also validate this behavior, confirming the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
