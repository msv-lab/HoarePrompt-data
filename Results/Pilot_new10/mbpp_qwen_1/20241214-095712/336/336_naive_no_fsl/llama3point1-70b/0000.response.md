Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through the given list `lst` and checks if every odd index contains an odd number. The function returns `False` as soon as it finds an even number at an odd index, and only returns `True` if no such case is found. This exactly matches the problem description. Since the function correctly implements the logic for all potential cases, it is correct.
