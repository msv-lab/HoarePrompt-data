Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a generator expression with `isinstance(x, int)` to check if each element in the list is an integer. It then passes this generator expression to `sum()`, which effectively counts the number of `True` values produced by the generator (since `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0` in a sum). This approach correctly counts the number of integer elements in the list for all potential cases. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
