Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate through the list and count how many elements are instances of the `int` class. This approach works for all potential cases:

- It correctly counts integers in the list (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
- It correctly handles mixed lists containing non-integer elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]`), counting only the integer elements.
- It correctly handles empty lists or lists with no integer elements (e.g., `[1.2, 'abc']` would return 0).

Since the function behaves as expected for all tested cases and there are no apparent edge cases that it fails to handle, the program is correct.
