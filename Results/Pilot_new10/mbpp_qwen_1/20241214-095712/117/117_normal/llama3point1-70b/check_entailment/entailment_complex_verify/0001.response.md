Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the list. The generator expression `isinstance(x, int) for x in lst` generates a sequence of `True` or `False` values based on whether each element in the list is an integer. The `sum()` function then counts these `True` values, effectively counting the number of integer elements. The original assessment accurately reflects this functionality, and the annotated version aligns with the problem description and the implementation details.
