Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. It uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to count the number of integer elements in the given list. The `isinstance(x, int)` checks if each element `x` in the list `lst` is an instance of the `int` class, and `sum()` adds up the `True` values (which are treated as 1) and `False` values (which are treated as 0) to give the total count of integer elements. This approach works for all potential cases, including edge cases like empty lists or lists containing non-integer types.
