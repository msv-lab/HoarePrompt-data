Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly uses a generator expression with `isinstance(x, int)` to count the number of integer elements in the list `lst`. The `sum()` function effectively counts the number of `True` values returned by the generator expression, as `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0`. This approach accurately meets the requirement of the problem description to return the number of integer elements in a given list. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
