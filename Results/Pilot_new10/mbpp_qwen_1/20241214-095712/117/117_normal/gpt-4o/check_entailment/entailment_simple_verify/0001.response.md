Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate through the list and count how many elements are instances of the `int` class. The provided test cases in the annotations demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different types of inputs, including lists with integers, non-integers, and mixed types. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
