Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list and returns the count of integer elements. The original assessment is accurate because the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases and handles various scenarios, including lists with mixed data types, empty lists, and lists with only non-integer elements. There are no apparent edge cases that the function fails to handle under the assumption of valid input.
