Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list and checks if it is an instance of `int`. The `sum` function then counts the number of `True` values generated by the expression, which corresponds to the number of integer elements in the list.

The examples given in the problem description confirm the functionality of the function:
- `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2`: There are two integers (1 and 2).
- `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3`: All three elements are integers.
- `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2`: There are two integers (1 and 4).

Since the function correctly handles these cases and the provided examples, and the logic within the function matches the problem description, the function is correct for every potential case.
