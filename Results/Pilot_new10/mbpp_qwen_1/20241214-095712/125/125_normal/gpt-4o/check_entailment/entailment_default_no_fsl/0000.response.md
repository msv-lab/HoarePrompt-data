Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. For any given list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, the function `func_1` divides the list into sublists where each sublist contains elements at intervals of `n`. The examples given in the output hints and the assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the provided cases. Since the function handles the logic correctly and the examples show no issues, the code is correct for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
