Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly states that the function is not correct. Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` does indeed split the list into sublists where each sublist contains every \(n\)-th element from the original list. The annotations clearly show that for each element in the list, the function appends it to the sublist indexed by its position modulo \(n\), which correctly achieves the desired functionality of splitting the list into sublists with every \(n\)-th element. Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
