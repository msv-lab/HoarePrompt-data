Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list `result` where each element is a list containing every \(n\)-th element from the original list `lst`. Specifically, the function creates a list of \(n\) sublists, and for each element in `lst`, it appends the element to the sublist indexed by its position modulo \(n\). This ensures that each sublist contains elements from `lst` at intervals of \(n\).**
