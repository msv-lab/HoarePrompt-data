The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\). The function returns a list `result` where each element is a list containing every \(n\)th element from the original list `lst`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list `result` where each element is a list containing every \(n\)th element from `lst`.**
