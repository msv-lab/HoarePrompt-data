Output State: **`lst` is a list with at least `n` elements, `result` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains every `n`-th element from `lst`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the `lst` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the element `element` from `lst`.
- The expression `i % n` determines the position in the `result` list where the current element `element` will be appended.
- After the loop completes, each list in `result` will contain elements from `lst` that are `n`-indexed apart.
- For example, if `n` is 3, the first list in `result` will contain elements from indices 0, 3, 6, etc., the second list will contain elements from indices 1, 4, 7, etc., and so on.
- The loop will execute exactly `len(lst)` times, as long as `lst` has at least `n` elements.
- If `lst` has fewer than `n` elements, the loop will still run, but the last list in `result` will be shorter than the others, depending on the number of remaining elements in `lst`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `result` will be a list of `n` lists, where each list contains every `n`-th element from `lst`.
