Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as input. It then returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains every nth element starting from index `i` for `i` in the range `[0, n)`. 

Here's why it is correct:

- The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of lists. For each `i` in the range `range(n)`, it slices the original list `lst` starting from index `i` with a step size of `n`.
- This ensures that each inner list will contain elements from the original list at intervals of `n`.
- The function handles all potential cases where `n` is within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ len(lst)), as it correctly processes the slicing operation without any boundary issues.

Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.
