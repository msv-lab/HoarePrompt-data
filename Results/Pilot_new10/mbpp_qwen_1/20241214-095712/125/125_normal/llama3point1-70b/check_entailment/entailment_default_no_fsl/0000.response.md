Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code `func_1(lst, n)` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses list comprehension to split the input list `lst` into sublists, each containing elements starting from every nth position. Specifically, for each `i` in the range `range(n)`, it creates a sublist starting from index `i` and taking every `n`th element thereafter. This approach handles all potential cases where `1 <= n <= len(lst)`. Therefore, the code satisfies the problem description for every potential case.
