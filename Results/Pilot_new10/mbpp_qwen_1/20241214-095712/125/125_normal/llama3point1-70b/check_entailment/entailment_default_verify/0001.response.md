Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` works correctly for all potential cases based on the problem description. However, upon reviewing the provided code and the output hints, it appears that the function does not handle the case when `n` is greater than the length of the list `lst`. According to the output hints, it should handle all potential cases where `n` is within the valid range (1 <= n <= len(lst)), but the current implementation will raise an error when `n` exceeds the length of the list because slicing with an invalid step will result in an empty list. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate as the function does not cover all potential cases as described.
