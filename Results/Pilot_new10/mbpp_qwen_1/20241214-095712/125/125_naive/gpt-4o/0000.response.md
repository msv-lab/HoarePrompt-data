Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not split the list for every nth element but instead groups elements by their index modulo n. This means that for the given examples, the function works as intended. However, the problem description asks for splitting the list into sublists where each sublist contains every nth element. 

For instance, if we consider the input `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` with `n=3`, the expected output would be `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`. However, the function produces the following sublists: `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`, which is actually grouping elements by their index modulo 3, not splitting the list every third element.

To achieve the desired functionality, the function should modify its logic to create sublists where each sublist contains every nth element starting from the first, second, etc., element. The current implementation does not meet this requirement.
