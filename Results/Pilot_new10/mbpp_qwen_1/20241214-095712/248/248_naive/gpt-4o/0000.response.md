Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The function takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing the same elements. The assertions provided in the code also correctly demonstrate this behavior for different inputs. Since the function works as expected for the given examples and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
