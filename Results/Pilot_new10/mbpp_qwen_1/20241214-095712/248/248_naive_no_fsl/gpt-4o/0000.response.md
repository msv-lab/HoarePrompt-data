Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as described in the problem statement. The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the input list to a tuple, which is exactly what the problem requires. All the provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected. Since there are no potential cases found where the program does not meet the requirements, the function is correct.
