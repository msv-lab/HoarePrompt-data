Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `input_list` as an argument and returns a tuple containing all elements from that list. This exactly matches the requirement to "Write a function to convert a list to a tuple." The function consistently performs this operation for any list input provided, thus adhering to the problem description in all cases.
