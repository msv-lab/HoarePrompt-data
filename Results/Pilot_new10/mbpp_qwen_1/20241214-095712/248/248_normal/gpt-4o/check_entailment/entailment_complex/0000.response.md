Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all the elements of the list. The assertions provided in the comments verify that the function works correctly for different lists, including lists with duplicate elements and lists with a single element. Since the function converts the list to a tuple without any modifications or additional operations, it satisfies the requirement of simply converting a list to a tuple. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
