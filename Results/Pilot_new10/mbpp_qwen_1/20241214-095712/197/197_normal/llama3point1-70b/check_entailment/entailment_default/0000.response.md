Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. It uses a generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` to count how many times each element in `lst` appears in `tup`, and then sums these counts using the `sum()` function. This approach ensures that all elements in `lst`, including duplicates, are counted correctly. The output hints confirm that the function returns the sum of counts of elements from `lst` that are present in `tup`, with elements not found in `tup` being counted as 0. Therefore, the code meets the problem description for every potential case.
