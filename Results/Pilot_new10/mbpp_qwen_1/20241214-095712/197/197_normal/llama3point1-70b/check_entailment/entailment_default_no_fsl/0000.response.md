Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to count the occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup`. However, this approach does not provide the desired output because:

- The `count` method of a tuple returns the number of times an element appears in the tuple. If an element from `lst` is not present in `tup`, `tup.count(element)` will return 0. Therefore, the generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` will yield 0 for each element not present in `tup`.
- The `sum` function sums up these counts, but it only gives the total count of all elements in `lst` that are present in `tup`, not the individual counts of each element.

To achieve the desired functionality, the code should return a dictionary or another collection type that maps each element from `lst` to its count in `tup`. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    result = {}
    for element in lst:
        result[element] = tup.count(element)
    return result
```

This version of the function will correctly count and return the occurrences of each element from `lst` that are present in `tup`.
