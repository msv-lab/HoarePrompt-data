#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and lst is a list.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the sum of counts of elements from list 'lst' that are present in tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the sum of counts of elements from `lst` that are present in `tup`. This includes all elements in `lst`, regardless of whether they are unique or repeated. If an element in `lst` is not found in `tup`, its count is considered as 0.
