Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and it returns the total number of occurrences of all elements from `elements` in `tup`. This is achieved by using a generator expression inside the `sum` function to count occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function correctly accepts two parameters: a tuple (`tup`) and a list (`elements`).
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The line `count = sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)` correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup` and sums them up.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns the total count, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

The assertions provided also validate different scenarios and confirm that the function behaves as expected across multiple test cases. Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
