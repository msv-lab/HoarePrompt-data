Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the list `elements` within the tuple `tup`. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. The annotated version clearly describes the states and the functionality of the program, indicating that it meets the requirements of the problem description. There are no issues or edge cases noted in the provided code and annotations that would suggest the original assessment is incorrect.
