Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the list `elements` within the tuple `tup`. The original assessment correctly identifies that the function works as intended based on the problem description and the provided test cases. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected, summing up the counts of specified elements in the given tuple, and the provided assertions validate this behavior. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
