Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the list in the given tuple. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the logic of the function is sound. The function iterates over each element in the `elements` list, counts its occurrences in the tuple `tup`, and sums these counts. The annotated version clearly describes the state of the program at different points, reinforcing the correctness of the function based on the problem description.
