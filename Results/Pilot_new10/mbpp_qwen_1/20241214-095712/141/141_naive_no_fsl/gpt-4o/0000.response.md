Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's verify this by considering various cases:

1. **Positive Cases:**
   - For `n = 1234`, the function returns `True` because the frequencies of digits are:
     - 1: 1 (≤ 1)
     - 2: 1 (≤ 2)
     - 3: 1 (≤ 3)
     - 4: 1 (≤ 4)
   - For `n = 321`, the function returns `True` because the frequencies of digits are:
     - 1: 1 (≤ 1)
     - 2: 1 (≤ 2)
     - 3: 1 (≤ 3)

2. **Negative Cases:**
   - For `n = 51241`, the function returns `False` because the frequency of the digit '5' is 1, but '5' itself is 5, which satisfies the condition, and the frequency of the digit '1' is 2, which is greater than '1', but the frequency of '2' is 1 (≤ 2), and so on. However, the condition is only violated for '5' being 1 and the frequency of '1' being 2, which is not a contradiction since '5' is checked before '1'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 0`, the function correctly returns `True` because there are no digits to check.
   - For `n = 99999`, the function returns `True` because each digit '9' appears up to 5 times, which is ≤ 9.
   - For `n = 1000`, the function returns `True` because the digit '1' appears once, and the other digits (0) appear zero times, which are both ≤ their respective values.

Since the function handles all tested cases correctly and no counterexamples were found, the function `func_1` is correct according to the problem description.
