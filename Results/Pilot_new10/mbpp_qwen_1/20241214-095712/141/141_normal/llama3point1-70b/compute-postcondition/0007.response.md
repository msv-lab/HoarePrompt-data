Postcondition: ***`str_n` is a string with at least one character, and the count of the digit in `str_n` is either less than or equal to the integer value of the next character in `str_n`. If the count of the digit in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of the next character, the function returns False. Otherwise, no change is made to the string `str_n`.***
