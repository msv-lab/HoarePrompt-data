Output State: **`str_n` is a string with at least one character, and for every digit in `str_n`, the count of that digit in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the next character in `str_n`. If any digit's count in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of the next character in `str_n`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns None.**
