According to the code, the loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string `str_n`. For the loop to execute, `str_n` must contain at least one character. The variable `n` being a non-negative integer and `str_n` being its string representation means that if `n` is 0, then `str_n` would be "0", which contains one character. Therefore, the loop can always execute given that `str_n` is a valid string representation of a non-negative integer.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Non-Negative Integer Check**: Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` will always be a valid string representation of a number.
2. **String Length Check**: For the loop to execute, `str_n` must contain at least one character. An empty string would not allow the loop to execute since there would be no digits to iterate over.

Given these points, we can conclude that the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is that `str_n` must have at least one character.

State: **`str_n` must have at least one character**
