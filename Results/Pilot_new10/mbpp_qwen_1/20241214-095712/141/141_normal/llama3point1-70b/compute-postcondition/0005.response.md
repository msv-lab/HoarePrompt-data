Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `str_n` must have at least one character.
   - The count of the digit in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `str_n`.
   - On each iteration, `digit` is set to the current character from `str_n`.

3. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `str_n`, the character `digit` will change in each iteration.
   - After the previous iteration, `digit` was set to one of the characters in `str_n`.
   - For the next iteration, `digit` will be set to the next character in `str_n`.
   - Therefore, `str_n` will remain the same as it had at least one character, but `digit` will now be the next character in `str_n`.

4. **New State**:
   - `str_n` must still have at least one character (since we haven't reached the end of `str_n` yet).
   - The count of the digit in `str_n` should now be checked against the new value of `digit`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`str_n` must have at least one character, and the count of the digit in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the next character in `str_n`**.
