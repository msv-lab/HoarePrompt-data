You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's verify this with some test cases:

1. For `n = 321`, the digit frequencies are:
   - '3' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 3 (True)
   - '2' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 2 (True)
   - '1' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 1 (True)
   The function returns `True`.

2. For `n = 124`, the digit frequencies are:
   - '1' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 1 (True)
   - '2' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 2 (True)
   - '4' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 4 (True)
   The function returns `True`.

3. For `n = 330`, the digit frequencies are:
   - '3' appears 2 times, but 2 > 3 (False)
   The function returns `False`.

4. For `n = 9876543210`, the digit frequencies are:
   - '9' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 9 (True)
   - '8' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 8 (True)
   - '7' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 7 (True)
   - '6' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 6 (True)
   - '5' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 5 (True)
   - '4' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 4 (True)
   - '3' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 3 (True)
   - '2' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 2 (True)
   - '1' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 1 (True)
   - '0' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 0 (False)
   The function returns `False`.

Since the function handles all tested cases correctly and the logic appears sound, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `str_n` is a string with at least one character, and for every digit in `str_n`, the count of that digit in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the next character in `str_n`. If any digit's count in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of the next character in `str_n`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns None.
    return True
    #The program returns True


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
