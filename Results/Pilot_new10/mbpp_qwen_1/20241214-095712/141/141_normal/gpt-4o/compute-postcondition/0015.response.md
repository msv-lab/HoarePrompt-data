Postcondition: ***`digit_str` must contain at least one character. If `digit` is already in `frequency`, its count is incremented by one. If `digit` is not in `frequency`, it is added to `frequency` with a count of 1. Regardless of whether the if condition is true or false, `digit` is ensured to be in `frequency` with its count updated accordingly.***
