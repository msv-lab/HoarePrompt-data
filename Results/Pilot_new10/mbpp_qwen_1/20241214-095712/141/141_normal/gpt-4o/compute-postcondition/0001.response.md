The given Python code initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency`. This does not assign any new values to existing variables or alter their states in any way. Therefore, the only changes are to the newly defined `frequency` dictionary, which is now an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`; `frequency` is an empty dictionary {}**
