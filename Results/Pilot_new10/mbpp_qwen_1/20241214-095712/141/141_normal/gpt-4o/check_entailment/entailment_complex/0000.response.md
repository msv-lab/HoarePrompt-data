Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Conversion to String**: The program first converts the input integer `n` to a string using `str(n)`. This step ensures that we can iterate over each digit individually.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: It then creates a dictionary `frequency` to count the occurrences of each digit in the string representation of `n`.

3. **Validation of Digits**: After calculating the frequency of each digit, the program iterates through the items in the `frequency` dictionary. For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit is less than or equal to the digit itself (converted to an integer using `int(digit)`). If any digit violates this condition, the function immediately returns `False`.

4. **Return Statement**: If no digit violates the condition during the iteration, the function returns `True`.

The provided test cases also align with the problem description:
- `func_1(1234)` returns `True` because the frequencies `[1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1]` are all valid.
- `func_1(51241)` returns `False` because the frequency of `5` is `1`, but `5` is greater than `1`.
- `func_1(321)` returns `True` because the frequencies `[3:1, 2:1, 1:1]` are all valid.

Since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is `True`.
