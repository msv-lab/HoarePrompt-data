Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input, which is then converted to a string `digit_str`. This conversion allows us to easily iterate over each digit and count its occurrences.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: A dictionary `frequency` is used to store the count of each digit found in `digit_str`. The loop iterates over each character in `digit_str`, updating the count for each digit in the dictionary.

3. **Validation**: After calculating the frequency of each digit, the function checks if the count of any digit is greater than the digit itself. If such a condition is found, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions check different scenarios:
   - `func_1(1234)` returns `True` because all digits (1, 2, 3, 4) have counts less than or equal to themselves.
   - `func_1(51241)` returns `False` because the digit '5' appears once but the digit itself is also '5', violating the condition.
   - `func_1(321)` returns `True` because all digits (3, 2, 1) have counts less than or equal to themselves.

Since the program correctly checks the frequency of each digit and ensures that the frequency of any digit is less than or equal to the digit itself, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
