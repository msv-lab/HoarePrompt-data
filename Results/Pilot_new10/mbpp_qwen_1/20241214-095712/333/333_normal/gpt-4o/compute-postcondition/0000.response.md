The code initializes an empty list called `stack`. The initial state specifies that `expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces. After executing the line of code, the stack is initialized, but no changes are made to `expr`. Therefore, the value of `expr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces; `stack` is an empty list**
