Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is either an empty list or contains `char`, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. If `char` is in the set of values of `matching_pairs` and the stack is not empty or the popped element from the stack is equal to the corresponding opening bracket of `char`, then the state remains unchanged. If `char` is not in the set of values of `matching_pairs`, the state also remains unchanged.***
