To solve this task, let's break down the information given and the logic of the loop:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
   - `stack` is either an empty list or contains characters (opening brackets).
   - `matching_pairs` is a dictionary where `)` maps to `'('`, `]` maps to `'['`, and `}` maps to `'{'`.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - For each character (`char`) in `expr`, the loop checks if `char` is a closing bracket.
   - If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, it checks if the stack is not empty and if the top element of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket of `char`.
     - If true, the top element is popped from the stack, and the state remains unchanged.
     - If false, the state remains unchanged.
   - If `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, the state remains unchanged.

Given the initial conditions, we need to determine the state after one iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `expr` is a string of mixed parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
   - `stack` is either empty or contains some opening brackets.
   - `matching_pairs` is `{')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}`.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - Consider the first character (`char`) in `expr`.
   - There are two scenarios to consider based on whether `char` is an opening or closing bracket.

#### Scenario 1: `char` is an Opening Bracket
- If `char` is an opening bracket, it is added to the stack.
- The state remains unchanged.

#### Scenario 2: `char` is a Closing Bracket
- If `char` is a closing bracket, the following must be true for the state to change:
  - The stack is not empty.
  - The top element of the stack is the matching opening bracket for `char`.

If both conditions are met, the top element is popped from the stack, and the state remains unchanged. If either condition fails, the state remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
Since the problem does not provide a specific character `char` or the current state of `stack`, we need to consider the most general case where no specific changes are made to the state during the first iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is either an empty list or contains characters, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.**

This answer reflects that the state does not change unless a specific character `char` causes a change, but since no such change is specified, the state remains the same.
