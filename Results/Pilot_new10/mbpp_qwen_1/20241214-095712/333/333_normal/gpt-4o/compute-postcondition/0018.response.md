According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the current state of the `stack`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `expr`. If `char` is an opening bracket (i.e., '(', '[', or '{'), it is added to the `stack`. If `char` is a closing bracket (i.e., ')', ']', or '}'), the loop checks if the `stack` is not empty and if the top of the `stack` matches the corresponding opening bracket according to the `matching_pairs`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
- `stack` is either an empty list or contains characters.
- `matching_pairs` is `{')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character (`char`) must be either an opening or a closing bracket. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the possible values for `char`:**
   - `char` can be any of the following: '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}'

2. **Adjust the state based on `char`:**
   - If `char` is an opening bracket ('(', '[', '{'):
     - It will be added to the `stack`.
   - If `char` is a closing bracket (')', ']', '}'):
     - The loop will check if the `stack` is not empty and if the top of the `stack` matches the corresponding opening bracket according to `matching_pairs`.
     - If the check fails, the function will return `False` and the loop will not continue.

Since the loop is about to execute again, the next character (`char`) must be one of the possible values listed above. However, without knowing the exact value of `char`, we cannot determine the exact contents of the `stack` yet. But we know the loop will continue as long as `char` is a valid character from the set of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on the value of `char`, but the general state remains the same.

State: **`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is either an empty list or contains characters, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}**.
