Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the provided annotated code and the original assessment, the function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced. The annotations confirm that the function uses a stack to track opening brackets and ensures that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket. The function handles all potential cases for balanced expressions involving `{`, `}`, `[`, and `]`. The provided test cases also validate its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
