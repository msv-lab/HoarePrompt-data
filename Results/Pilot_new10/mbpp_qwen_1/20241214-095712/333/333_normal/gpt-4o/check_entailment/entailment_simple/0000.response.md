Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks if a given string containing parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces is balanced. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check if the given expression is balanced or not. An expression is considered balanced if all types of brackets (parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces) are properly opened and closed in the correct order.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - A stack is used to keep track of opening brackets.
   - For each character in the expression:
     - If it's an opening bracket, it is pushed onto the stack.
     - If it's a closing bracket, the function checks whether the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, the expression is unbalanced, and the function returns `False`.
   - After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the expression is balanced, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the expression is unbalanced, and the function returns `False`.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1('{()}[{}]') == True`: The expression is balanced.
   - `func_1('{()}[{]') == False`: The expression is unbalanced because there is an unmatched closing square bracket.
   - `func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True`: The expression is balanced despite having multiple pairs of brackets.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles empty strings gracefully as it would return `True` since there are no unmatched brackets.
   - It correctly handles nested and interleaved brackets.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to check if the expression is balanced and passes all the provided test cases, it satisfies the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
