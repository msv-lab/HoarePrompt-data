Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a given expression containing parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces is balanced. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check if the expression has correctly matched opening and closing brackets.
2. **Implementation**: 
   - A stack is used to keep track of opening brackets.
   - For each character in the expression, if it is an opening bracket (i.e., `(`, `[`, `{`), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If it is a closing bracket (i.e., `)`, `]`, `}`), it checks whether the stack is empty or if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket. If not, the function returns `False`.
   - After processing all characters, the function returns `True` only if the stack is empty, indicating all opening brackets have matching closing brackets in the correct order.

Given these points, the program accurately checks the balance of brackets in any given expression according to the provided problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
