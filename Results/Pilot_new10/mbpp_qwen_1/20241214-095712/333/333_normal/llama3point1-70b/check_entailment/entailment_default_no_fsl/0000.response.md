Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if a given expression containing parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces is balanced. It uses a stack to match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The function returns `True` if the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, indicating all brackets are correctly matched, and `False` otherwise. This implementation handles all potential cases where the expression contains various combinations of these brackets, ensuring that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct sequence. Since the code matches the problem description and the output hints, it works correctly for every potential case.
