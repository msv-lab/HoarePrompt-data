Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement a function to check if a given expression is balanced in terms of its parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces. The function uses a stack to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The output hints confirm that the function returns `True` if the expression has correctly matched opening and closing brackets, and `False` otherwise. After reviewing the code and the hints, there doesn't seem to be any case where the program would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
