Postcondition: **`expression` must contain at least one character, `stack` is an empty list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}. If the character `char` is in the keys of the `brackets` dictionary, `stack` will either remain empty or contain `[char]` based on whether the corresponding closing bracket matches the top element of the stack. If `char` is in the values of the `brackets` dictionary and the stack is not empty or the popped character from the stack is equal to the corresponding opening bracket of `char`, the program continues execution with the updated state. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the initial state.**
