The code snippet `stack.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the `stack`. Given the initial conditions:

- `expression` must contain at least one character.
- `stack` is either empty or contains the most recent opening bracket.
- `brackets` is a dictionary containing matching brackets.

After executing the code, the `stack` will contain the new character appended to its previous contents (if any). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` must contain at least one character, `stack` contains the most recent opening bracket and the newly appended `char`, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}**
