Postcondition: ***`expression` must contain at least one character, `stack` is either empty or contains the most recent opening bracket. If `char` is in `brackets`, `stack` will contain the most recent opening bracket and the appended character `char`. If `char` is not in `brackets`, the function returns False if the top element of `stack` does not match the corresponding closing bracket for `char`, otherwise, `stack` remains unchanged.***
