Output State: **`expression` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is empty or contains a sequence of opening brackets that correspond to the correct order of closing brackets, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}. If the loop completes without returning False, the `expression` is correctly matched with no unmatched opening or closing brackets, and `stack` will be empty. Otherwise, if the loop returns False, the `expression` is incorrectly matched, and `stack` will contain unmatched opening brackets.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `expression` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
   - `stack` is an empty list.
   - `brackets` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each character `char` in `expression`:
     - If `char` is an opening bracket (i.e., `char` is in the keys of `brackets`), it is pushed onto the stack.
     - If `char` is a closing bracket (i.e., `char` is in the values of `brackets`), the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`.

3. **Final State After Loop Execution**:
   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means that all opening brackets have been properly closed in the correct order, and `stack` will be empty.
   - If the loop returns `False` at any point, it means there is at least one unmatched opening bracket left in the stack.

Thus, the final state of the program after the loop executes is that `expression` is correctly matched if `stack` is empty, and `expression` is incorrectly matched if `stack` contains unmatched opening brackets.
