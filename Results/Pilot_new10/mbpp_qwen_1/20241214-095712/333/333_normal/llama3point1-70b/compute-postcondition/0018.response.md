Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `expression` must contain at least one character.
   - `stack` is either empty or contains the most recent opening bracket.
   - If the `char` is a closing bracket and the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the `expression`.

3. **Loop Body**: During each iteration, the following steps occur:
   - The current `char` from the `expression` is checked.
   - If `char` is an opening bracket, it is pushed onto the `stack`.
   - If `char` is a closing bracket, the top element of the `stack` (if not empty) is popped and checked against `char` to determine if they match.
     - If they match, the function continues.
     - If they do not match, the function returns `False`.

4. **End of Current Iteration**: After processing one character, we need to update the state for the next iteration.

5. **Next Iteration State**: For the loop to continue, the next character from the `expression` needs to be processed. This means the `expression` should still contain characters, and the `stack` should be in a valid state to process the next character.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- Since the loop is about to process the next character, the `expression` must still contain characters.
- The `stack` must be either empty or contain the most recent opening bracket for the next character to be processed.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`expression` must contain at least one character, `stack` is either empty or contains the most recent opening bracket.**
