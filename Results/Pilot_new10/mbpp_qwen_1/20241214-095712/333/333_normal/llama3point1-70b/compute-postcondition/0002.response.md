According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `expression`. The loop will execute if `expression` contains at least one character.

Before the loop starts, the given states are:
- `expression` is a string containing only parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}').
- `stack` is an empty list.
- `brackets` is a dictionary mapping opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `expression` is not empty, as an empty string would prevent the loop from running.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

- `expression` must contain at least one character.

So, the final state should be:

State: **`expression` must contain at least one character, `stack` is an empty list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}**
