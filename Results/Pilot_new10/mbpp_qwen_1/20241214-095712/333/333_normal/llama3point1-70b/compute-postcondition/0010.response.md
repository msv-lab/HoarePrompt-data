Postcondition: ***`expression` must contain at least one character, `stack` is an empty list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']',}, the character `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary. If `char` is in the values of the `brackets` dictionary and the stack is not empty or the popped character from the stack is equal to the corresponding closing bracket of `char`, the program continues execution with the updated state. Otherwise, the program also continues execution with the same initial state since no changes were made.***
