Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It searches for the given `element` in the `array` using the `index` method. If the element is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns `(False, -1)`. This covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and output hints.
