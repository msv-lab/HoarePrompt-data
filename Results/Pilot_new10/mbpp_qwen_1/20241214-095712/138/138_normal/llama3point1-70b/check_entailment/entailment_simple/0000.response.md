Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `array` (a list of elements) and `element` (the value to search for within the array).
2. **Search Logic**: The function uses the `index` method of the list to find the index of the `element` in `array`.
3. **Success Case**: If the `element` is found in `array`, the function returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of `element` in `array`.
4. **Failure Case**: If the `element` is not found in `array`, a `ValueError` is raised, which is caught by the except block. In this case, the function returns a tuple `(False, -1)`.

This implementation adheres to the problem description in all cases:
- It returns a tuple with a boolean indicating whether the element was found.
- The second element of the tuple is the index of the element if found, otherwise `-1`.

Thus, the program is correct as it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all possible cases.
