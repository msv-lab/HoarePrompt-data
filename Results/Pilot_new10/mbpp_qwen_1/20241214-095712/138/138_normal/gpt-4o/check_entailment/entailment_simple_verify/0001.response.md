Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return a tuple with a boolean indicating whether the element is present and its index position or `-1` if not found. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected:

- When the element is found in the array, the function correctly returns `(True, index)`.
- When the element is not found, the function correctly returns `(False, -1)`.

The provided test cases also cover typical scenarios and demonstrate the expected behavior. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
