Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both correctly describe the behavior of the `func_1` function. The function iterates through the array and returns the correct tuple indicating whether the element is found and its index. The provided test cases cover typical scenarios, and the function handles them correctly. The annotations also correctly reflect the state of the program at different points. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
