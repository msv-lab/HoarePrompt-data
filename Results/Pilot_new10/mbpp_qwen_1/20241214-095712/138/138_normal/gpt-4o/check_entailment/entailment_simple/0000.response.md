Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes in an array (`arr`) and an element (`element`), and returns a tuple with two values:

1. A boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array.
2. The index of the element if found, otherwise `-1`.

The program uses a `for` loop to iterate through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and value of each element. If the current element matches the search element, it immediately returns a tuple `(True, index)` indicating the element was found and its index. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`. 

This approach ensures that the function behaves as specified in all cases. The provided test cases also align with this behavior:

- In the first test case, `31` is found at index `3`, so the function returns `(True, 3)`.
- In the second test case, `61` is found at index `7`, so the function returns `(True, 7)`.
- In the third test case, `48` is found at index `6`, so the function returns `(True, 6)`.

Thus, the program correctly implements the required functionality for any given input array and element.
