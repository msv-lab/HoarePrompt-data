Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks for only one pair of consecutive digits in the middle of the string representation of the number to determine if the number is undulating. An undulating number is defined as a number where the digits alternate in a specific pattern (e.g., 121212, 353535). However, the current implementation only checks one such pair and will return `True` for numbers that do not meet the full criteria for being undulating.

For example, consider the number `1234`. The function will check if `2 < 3` and `3 < 4`, which is true, but it will also check the condition for the next pair (`3 < 4` and `4 < 5`), which is not applicable since there is no digit after `4`. Since the loop only runs up to `len(n) - 2`, it will incorrectly return `True` for numbers like `1234`.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that the alternating pattern holds for the entire length of the number, including checking both possible patterns (increasing then decreasing or decreasing then increasing) for each pair of consecutive digits throughout the entire string.
