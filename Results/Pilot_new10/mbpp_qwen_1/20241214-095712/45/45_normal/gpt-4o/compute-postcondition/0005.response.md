The code assigns the second character of the string `s` to the variable `second_digit`. Since `s` is a string representation of a positive integer `n` and the length of `s` is at least 3, the variable `second_digit` will be the character at index 1 of the string `s`.

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `s` remains the string representation of `n`.
- `first_digit` remains the first character of `s`.

The Output State is:

**`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`.**
