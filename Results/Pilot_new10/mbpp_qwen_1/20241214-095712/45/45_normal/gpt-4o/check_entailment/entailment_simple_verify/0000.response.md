Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the logic and behavior described in the original assessment. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a given number is undulating by ensuring that the digits alternate between two distinct digits. The provided test cases and the annotations confirm that the function handles the problem description accurately. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
