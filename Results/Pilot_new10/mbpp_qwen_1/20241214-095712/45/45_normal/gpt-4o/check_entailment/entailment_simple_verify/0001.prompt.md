You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(1212121) == True
assert func_1(1991) == False
assert func_1(121) == True

def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is defined as a number that has an alternating pattern of digits (e.g., 121, 353, 12121). The function converts the number to a string and then checks if the length of the string is at least 3. It then ensures that the first two digits are different and iterates through the rest of the string, checking that the digits at even indices match the first digit and the digits at odd indices match the second digit. Based on the provided test cases and the logic implemented, the function correctly identifies undulating numbers and returns `False` for non-undulating numbers. No edge cases or potential inputs were found where the function fails to meet the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(1212121) == True
assert func_1(1991) == False
assert func_1(121) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if (len(s) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if (first_digit == second_digit) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, and the loop has executed for all valid `i` values such that `2 <= i < len(s)`. If any condition inside the loop evaluates to `False`, the function returns `False` at that point. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.
    return True
    #The program returns True


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
