The code `undulating = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `undulating`. The initial value of `n` remains unchanged as a string representation of a positive integer. Therefore, the only variable that gets updated is `undulating`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer, `undulating` is True**
