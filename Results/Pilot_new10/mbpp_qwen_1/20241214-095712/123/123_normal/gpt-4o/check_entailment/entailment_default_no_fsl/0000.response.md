Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts based on the given integer `L`. It returns a tuple containing the first part of the list (up to index `L`) and the second part of the list (starting from index `L`). The function handles all the provided test cases correctly, including edge cases like when `L` is 0 or equal to the length of the list. The function also respects the constraints `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, ensuring it only slices the list within valid bounds. Therefore, the code works as expected for every potential case described in the problem.
