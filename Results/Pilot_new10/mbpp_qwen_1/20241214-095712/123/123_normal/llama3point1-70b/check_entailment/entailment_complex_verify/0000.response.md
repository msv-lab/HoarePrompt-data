Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`, and the second part contains the remaining elements. The annotated version clearly describes that the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the `L`-th element, and the second list contains elements from the `L`-th element to the end of `lst`. This matches the problem description perfectly, and the function works correctly for any valid list and integer `L` within the specified range.
