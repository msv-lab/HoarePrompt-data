The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `L`, which is an integer such that \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)}\). The function returns two lists: the first list contains the elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the `L`-th element, and the second list contains the elements from the `L`-th element to the end of `lst`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and return two lists as specified.
