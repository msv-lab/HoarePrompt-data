Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and the second part contains the remaining elements. This behavior matches the problem description for all potential cases. The slicing operation `lst[:L]` creates a sublist containing the first `L` elements, and `lst[L:]` creates a sublist containing the remaining elements after the first `L` elements. Therefore, the function works correctly for any list and any valid value of `L` (where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`).
