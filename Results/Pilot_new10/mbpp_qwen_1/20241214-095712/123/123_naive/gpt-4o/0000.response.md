Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`, and returns them as a tuple. The examples given also demonstrate that the function works as expected for different types of inputs (integer and string lists). Since the function handles the specified cases correctly and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
