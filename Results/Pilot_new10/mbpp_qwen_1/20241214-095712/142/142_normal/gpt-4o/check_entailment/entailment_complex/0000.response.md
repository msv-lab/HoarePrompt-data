Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an element `element` as input and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Loop Through the List**: The function iterates through each item in the list using a `for` loop. It checks if each item is not equal to the given element.
2. **Return False on Mismatch**: If any item in the list is found to be different from the given element, the function immediately returns `False`.
3. **Return True on Match**: If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it means all items in the list are equal to the given element, and thus the function returns `True`.

The test cases provided also confirm its correctness:
- `assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False`: The list contains elements that are not 'blue', so the function should return `False`.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False`: The list contains elements that are not `7`, so the function should return `False`.
- `assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True`: All elements in the list are 'green', so the function should return `True`.

Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description for all given cases, the program is correct.
