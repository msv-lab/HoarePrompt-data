Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the provided test cases confirm that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The original assessment is accurate because the function logic is sound, and the test cases cover various scenarios, including both positive and negative cases. The annotated version further clarifies the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the original assessment. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
