#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is a value.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list, `item` is equal to `element`, and the function returns True if all elements in `lst` are not equal to `element`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `lst` is empty), the function returns True.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`, and returns `False` if any element in `lst` matches `element`; otherwise, it returns `True`.
