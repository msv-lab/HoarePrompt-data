Output State: **`lst` is a list, `item` is equal to `element`, and the function returns True if all elements in `lst` are not equal to `element`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `lst` is empty), the function returns True.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Conditions:** The list `lst` must exist, and `element` is a value we are checking against each element in the list.
- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop iterates over each `item` in `lst`.
  - If any `item` in `lst` is not equal to `element`, the function immediately returns `False`.
  - If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`.

- **Final State After Loop Completion:**
  - If the loop completes (i.e., `lst` is not empty), it means no element in `lst` was found to be different from `element`, so the function returns `True`.
  - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `lst` is empty), the function implicitly returns `True` because there are no elements to check, satisfying the condition that all elements (none) are not different from `element`.

Thus, the output state captures both scenarios: when the loop completes and when it does not.
