Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element using the `all()` function and a generator expression. The output hints accurately summarize the functionality of the function, indicating that it returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element and `False` otherwise. There is no indication in the problem description or the code that the function fails to handle any edge cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
