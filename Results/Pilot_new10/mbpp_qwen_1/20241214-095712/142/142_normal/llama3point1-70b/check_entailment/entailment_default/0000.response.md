Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an element `element`, and it returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element. It uses the built-in `all()` function along with a generator expression to check if every item in the list matches the given element. If any item does not match, `all()` will immediately return `False`. This implementation works for all potential cases, including edge cases like an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. Therefore, the code satisfies the problem description for every potential case.
