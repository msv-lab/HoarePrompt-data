Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses the built-in `all()` function to check if all elements in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a sequence of boolean values, where each value indicates whether the corresponding item in `lst` is equal to `element`. The `all()` function then returns `True` only if all these boolean values are `True`, meaning all items in the list are equal to the given element. This logic matches the problem description accurately for every potential case.
