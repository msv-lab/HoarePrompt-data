Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The use of the `all()` function combined with a generator expression ensures that the function returns `True` only if every item in the list matches the given element, which aligns perfectly with the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
