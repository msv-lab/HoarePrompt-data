Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The program imports the `math` module to use \(\pi\) and performs the calculation as described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
