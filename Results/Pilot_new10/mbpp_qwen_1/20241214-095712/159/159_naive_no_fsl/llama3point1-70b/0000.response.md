Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume. Given the problem description to find the volume of a cone, this function meets the requirement and works for all valid inputs (i.e., non-negative values for `radius` and `height`). Since there are no identified cases where the program does not meet the requirements, the correctness is True.
