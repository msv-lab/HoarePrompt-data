Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are non-negative floating-point numbers as specified in the problem description. The function then computes the volume using the provided formula and returns the result.

The assertions at the beginning of the program validate the function with different sets of input values and compare the results with expected values using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance of 0.001. These checks ensure that the function produces accurate results for the given test cases.

Since the function correctly implements the required formula and the provided test cases are verified to be accurate, the program meets the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
