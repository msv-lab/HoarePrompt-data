Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume. The output hints confirm that the function accepts two non-negative parameters `radius` and `height` and returns the volume of a cone using the specified formula. Given the problem description and the output hints, the function meets the requirements and works for all valid inputs as assumed. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
