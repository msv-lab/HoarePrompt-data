Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone, \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are assumed to be non-negative numbers. Since the problem description asks for a function to find the volume of a cone and the provided code accurately implements this, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
