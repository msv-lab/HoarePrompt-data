Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly removes characters from the given string `s` that have odd index values. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string and includes only those characters whose index is even. This matches the problem description perfectly. The examples given (`func_1('abcdef') == 'ace'`, `func_1('python') == 'pto'`, `func_1('data') == 'dt'`, `func_1('lambs') == 'lms'`) all demonstrate that the function works as expected. Since the function returns a new string containing characters from the original string at even indices, it satisfies the problem description for every potential case.
