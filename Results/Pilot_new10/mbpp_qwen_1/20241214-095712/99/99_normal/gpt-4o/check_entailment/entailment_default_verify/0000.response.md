Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing characters from `s` at even indices. The examples given in both the problem description and the output hints align with the function's behavior, and there are no indications that the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
