Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly indicates that the function `func_1` returns a string containing every second character from the original string `s`, starting from the first character. This aligns with the problem description which asks to remove characters from a given string that have odd index values. The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the logic to achieve the desired outcome.
