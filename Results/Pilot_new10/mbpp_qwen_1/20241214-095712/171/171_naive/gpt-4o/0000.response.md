Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns the opposite of what the problem description asks for. The description states that the function should determine whether the parity of a given number is odd, which would mean returning `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, the function uses `n % 2 != 0`, which checks if the number is odd, but the function returns `False` in this case. Therefore, for even numbers, the function incorrectly returns `False`.

For example, for the input `12`, the correct output should be `False` (since 12 is even), but the function also returns `False`, which is correct according to the provided test cases. However, for the input `6`, the function should return `False` (since 6 is even), but it will actually return `True`, which is incorrect. Hence, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
