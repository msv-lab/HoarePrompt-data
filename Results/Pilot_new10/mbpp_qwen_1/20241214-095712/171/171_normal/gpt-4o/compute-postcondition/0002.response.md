Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even.** 

This summary is derived directly from the code, which uses the modulus operator (`%`) to determine if `n` is odd or even. The code checks if `n % 2 != 0`, which correctly identifies odd numbers. If `n` is even, `n % 2` would be `0`, making the condition false and returning `False`. Therefore, the function works as intended without any missing logic or edge cases that need to be addressed.
