Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd, which means it should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, the current implementation checks if the number is odd using `return n % 2 != 0`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should check if the number is even using `return n % 2 == 0`.

To fix this, the function should be:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

This corrected function will return `True` for even numbers and `False` for odd numbers, which matches the problem description.
