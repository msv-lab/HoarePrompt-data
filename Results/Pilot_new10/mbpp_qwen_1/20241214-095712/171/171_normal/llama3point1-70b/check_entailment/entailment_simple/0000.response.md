Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks for a function that determines whether the parity (odd or even) of a given number is odd. However, the provided function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. This means the function actually checks if a number is odd, not if its parity is odd.

To correctly implement the functionality as per the problem description, the function should check if the number has odd parity (i.e., if the number itself is odd). The current implementation already does this, but there seems to be a misunderstanding in the problem description since checking if a number is odd is equivalent to checking if its parity is odd. 

If the intention was to check if the number's parity is odd (which would mean the number is odd), then the current implementation is correct. Therefore, if the problem description is interpreted to mean checking if the number itself is odd, the program is correct. But if the intention was to check if the number's parity is odd (which would mean checking if the number is odd), then the program is also correct.

Given the typical interpretation of parity (odd/even nature of a number), the function correctly identifies whether the number is odd, which aligns with checking the parity being odd. Hence, if the problem description meant to check if the number is odd, the function is correct.
