Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the parity of a given number as per the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should check whether the parity of a given number is odd. However, the function currently returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. This contradicts the problem description. The function should return `True` if the number has an even parity (i.e., is even) and `False` if the number has an odd parity (i.e., is odd). Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the function needs to be corrected to meet the requirements.
