Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks the parity of a given number `n` by using the expression `n % 2 != 0`, which returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. The annotated version clearly explains that the function returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer, aligning with the problem description of finding whether the parity of a given number is odd. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
