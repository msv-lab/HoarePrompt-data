Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code correctly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`, which returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. Based on the problem description, the task is to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. According to standard mathematical definitions, a number has odd parity if it is odd. Therefore, the function as written is actually returning the correct result for the given problem. The original assessment was based on a misunderstanding of the mathematical definition of parity. The function correctly identifies the parity of a number as odd, which aligns with the problem description.
