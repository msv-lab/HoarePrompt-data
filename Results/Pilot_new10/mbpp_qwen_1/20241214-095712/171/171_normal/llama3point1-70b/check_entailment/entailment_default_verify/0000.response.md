Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly determines whether a given integer `n` has odd parity. The output hints confirm that the function returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers, which aligns with the problem description. The function handles all potential cases for integer inputs as expected, making the original assessment of correctness true.
