Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns the list with the highest sum of its elements. This is achieved by using the `max` function with `key=sum`, which compares the sums of the lists and returns the one with the maximum sum. Given the problem description, this function will work correctly for all potential cases since it handles all lists, including edge cases like empty lists or lists containing negative numbers. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
