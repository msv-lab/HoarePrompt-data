Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The function must return the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
   
2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` as an empty list.
   - It iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
   - For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements (`current_sum`).
   - If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist.
   - After iterating through all sublists, it returns `max_list`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
     - A list of multiple sublists with varying sums (e.g., [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]).
     - A list with a single sublist (e.g., [[2, 3, 1]]).
     - Sublists with similar sums but one having a higher sum overall (e.g., [[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]).

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum and returns it.
   - The logic ensures that even if multiple sublists have the same highest sum, any one of them will be returned (due to the assignment inside the `if` statement).
   - The use of `float('-inf')` ensures that any list sum will be greater, initializing `max_sum` correctly.

Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
