Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the provided code and the annotations, the function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at different points, and the original assessment correctly notes that the function works as expected for the provided examples and there are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that are not handled. The annotations confirm that the function iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates the maximum sum and corresponding sublist as needed. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
