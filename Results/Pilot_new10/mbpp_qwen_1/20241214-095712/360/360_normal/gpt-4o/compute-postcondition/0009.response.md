The code `current_sum = sum(sublist)` calculates the sum of elements in `sublist`. However, the initial state does not specify which sublist is being referred to, only that `list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists. The `current_sum` variable is assigned the sum of one of these sublists, but the exact sublist is not specified.

Given this, we can state that `current_sum` is now the sum of one of the sublists in `list_of_lists`, while the rest of the lists and `list_of_lists` itself remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists, `current_sum` is the sum of one of its sublists**
