The code assigns the value of `sublist` to `max_list`. Since `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is updated to be the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least one sublist, `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`**
