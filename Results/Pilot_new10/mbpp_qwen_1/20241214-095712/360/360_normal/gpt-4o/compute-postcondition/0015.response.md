The code `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to the current value of `current_sum`. Since the initial state does not specify any specific values for `current_sum` or `max_sum`, we can only say that `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the current sublist, `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is either unchanged (if `current_sum` is less than `max_sum`) or updated to `current_sum` and the current sublist (if `current_sum` is greater than or equal to `max_sum`).**
