Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the functionality of the `func_1` function. It takes a list of lists of integers as input and returns the sublist with the highest sum of its elements. The original assessment correctly identified that the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The annotated version reinforces this by clearly stating the behavior of the function and confirming that it handles all valid cases, including edge cases like empty lists or lists containing negative numbers. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
