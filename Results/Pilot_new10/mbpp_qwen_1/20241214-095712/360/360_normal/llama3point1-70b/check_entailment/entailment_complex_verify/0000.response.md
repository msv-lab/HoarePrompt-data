Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes that the function `func_1` correctly finds and returns the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. Given the problem description and the provided code, the function behaves as expected. The `max` function with `key=sum` correctly compares the sums of the lists and returns the one with the maximum sum. The annotated version reinforces this understanding, and there are no issues or edge cases identified that would render the original assessment incorrect.
