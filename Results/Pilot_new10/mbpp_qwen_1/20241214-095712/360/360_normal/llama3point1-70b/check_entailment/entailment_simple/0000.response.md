Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists of integers. This aligns with the problem description that mentions "a list of lists of integers."

2. **Function Logic**: Inside the function, the `max` function is used with the `key=sum` argument. The `key=sum` specifies that the maximum should be determined based on the sum of the elements within each sublist. This exactly matches the requirement of returning the list with the highest sum of elements.

3. **Output**: The function returns the list from `lists` that has the maximum sum when the elements of each sublist are added together. This perfectly aligns with the problem description.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the specified functionality for any valid input, making it correct according to the problem description.
