Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses the `max` function with `key=sum` to find the sublist within the input `lists` that has the highest sum of its elements. This ensures that the function will always return the sublist with the maximum sum, meeting the requirements of the problem description. Since the function logic aligns with the specified behavior, it will work correctly for any input list of lists of integers, including cases where multiple sublists have the same highest sum.
