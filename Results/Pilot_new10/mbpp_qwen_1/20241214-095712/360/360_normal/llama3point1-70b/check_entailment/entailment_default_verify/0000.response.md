Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists using the `max` function with `key=sum`. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list of lists of integers and returns the sublist with the highest sum of its elements, which aligns with the problem description. The function works correctly for any valid input list of lists, and there are no edge cases or specific inputs that this function would fail to handle based on the given problem description.
