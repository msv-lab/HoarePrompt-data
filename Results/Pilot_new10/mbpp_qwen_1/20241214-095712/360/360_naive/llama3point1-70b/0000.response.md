Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The `max` function with `key=sum` will compare the sums of the lists and return the one with the maximum sum. This approach handles all potential cases where the input is a list of lists, and it works correctly for any such input. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that this function would fail to handle based on the given problem description.
