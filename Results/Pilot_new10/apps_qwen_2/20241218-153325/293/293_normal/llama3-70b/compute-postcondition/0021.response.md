The function `func` accepts two parameters: `h` and `n`. The parameter `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), and the parameter `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\). 

Case_1: The function returns `h`.
Case_2: The function returns `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `h` and `n`, where `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\) inclusive, and it returns `h` in one case and `n` in another case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `h` and `n`, where `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\), and returns `h` in one case and `n` in another case.**
