Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Algorithm Mismatch**: The given algorithm in the problem description uses an infinite command string "LRLRLRL..." to navigate through the binary tree. However, the provided program does not simulate this behavior. Instead, it uses a different approach to calculate the number of nodes visited.

2. **Calculation Logic**: The program calculates the number of nodes visited by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 and adding either `n // 2 - 1` or `n // 2` to `ans` based on whether `n` is even or odd. This logic does not accurately reflect the described algorithm. Specifically:
   - The algorithm moves through the tree based on a pattern of 'L' and 'R', and the program's logic does not account for the skipping and backtracking rules mentioned in the problem description.
   - The program assumes a linear path rather than the zigzag pattern ("LRLRLRL...") that the player follows.

3. **Expected Behavior**: According to the problem description, the player should follow the pattern "LRLRLRL..." to determine the path. For example, in the first test case (`1 2`), the player would follow the path "L" (left child), which directly leads to the exit. In the second test case (`2 3`), the path would be "LLR" (left, left, right). The program, however, does not simulate these steps.

To meet the requirements of the problem, the program should simulate the traversal according to the specified algorithm. A correct implementation would involve maintaining the state of the current node and following the "LRLRLRL..." pattern to determine the path.
