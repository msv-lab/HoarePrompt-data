Postcondition: ***`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 2, `path` is the remaining part of the original path (one character shorter), `current_level` is 1, `current_node` is either 3 or 4 depending on the value of `direction`. If `direction` is '0', `current_node` is either 3 or 5. Otherwise, `current_node` is either 4 or 6 depending on the first character of the original `path`.***
