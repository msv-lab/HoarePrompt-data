The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` updates the value of `current_node`. Initially, `current_node` is 0. Plugging this into the equation:

- `current_node` becomes `2 * 0 + 1`, which results in `1`.

The other variables (`total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, `current_level`, `direction`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is the binary representation of `n - 1`, padded to length `h` with leading zeros, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 1, the direction is '0'**
