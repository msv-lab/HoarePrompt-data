The code initializes an empty list named `cycle`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `not visited[2]` also remains true. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `not visited[2]` is true, and `cycle` is an empty list.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `not visited[2]` is true, `cycle` is an empty list**
