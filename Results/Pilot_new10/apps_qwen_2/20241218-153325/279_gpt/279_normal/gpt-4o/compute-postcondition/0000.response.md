The line `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This means that instead of using the usual `input()` function to read input, the program will now use `sys.stdin.read` to read the entire input at once. However, this does not change the values of `n`, `p`, or `b`. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and all p_i are unique), `b` is a list of n integers consisting of zeros and ones, and `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`.**
