The code `x = p[x] - 1` impacts the variable `x`. Initially, `x` is 0, and `p` is not defined in the given state. However, based on the initial state, `p` should be a list that contains `cycle`, which is `[1, 0]`. 

Given `x` is initially 0, `p[x]` would refer to `p[0]`, which is 1. Thus, `x` will be updated to `1 - 1`, which is 0.

The states of other variables (`i`, `n`, `cycle`, `x`, and `visited[0]`) remain unchanged except for `x`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `cycle` is [1, 0], `x` is 0, `visited[0]` is True**
