Functionality: **The function `func_2(a, b)` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers between 1 and \(10^9\). It calculates the product of `a` and `b`, divides this product by the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`, and returns the integer division of the result. The function does not handle cases where `func_1(a, b)` might return zero or negative values, which would lead to a division by zero error or non-integer results.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
- If `func_1(a, b)` returns a negative number, the function will still attempt the division, potentially resulting in a negative quotient or a non-integer value, which will be converted to an integer due to the integer division operation.
