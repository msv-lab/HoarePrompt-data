The line `min_lcm = current_lcm` assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. This means that `min_lcm` now holds the same value as `current_lcm`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `a` is `(a + new_candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is `b + new_candidate - 1`, `new_b` is `(b + new_candidate + candidate - 2) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is the minimum \( k \) value found so far such that `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `new_candidate < min_k`).

Output State: **`a` is `(a + new_candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is `b + new_candidate - 1`, `new_b` is `(b + new_candidate + candidate - 2) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is `current_lcm`, `min_k` is the minimum \( k \) value found so far such that `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `new_candidate < min_k`).**
