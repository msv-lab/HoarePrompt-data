Postcondition: ***`new_a` is \((a + c - 1) // c * c\), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`, `k` is a positive integer, and `diff // k` is an integer; `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is a value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`). Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.***
