Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\). `diff` is the absolute value of \(a - b\), and `k` is the value of `min_k` when the loop exits. If `diff % k == 0`, then `a` is the smallest multiple of `min_k` that is greater than or equal to `a + min_k - 1`, `b` is the smallest multiple of `min_k` that is greater than or equal to `b + min_k - 1`, and `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`. If `diff % k != 0`, no changes are made to the values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, and `k`.**
