Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States
- `i` is 1.
- `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`.
- `dp[2]` is the maximum value of `dp[1] + cakes[2][0]` or `dp[2] + cakes[2][0]`.
- For every `k` in the range of `2` to `n-1`, `dp[k+1]` is the maximum value between `max_value_1` and `dp[j] + cakes[k+1][0]` for some valid `j` (where `j` can be any index from `1` to `k`).

### For Loop Analysis
The for loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop will run as long as `j` is in the range from `0` to `i-1`.

### Determining Necessary Adjustments
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop will iterate as long as `j < i`.
   - Given `i` is 1, the loop will only run if `j` is 0 (since `range(1)` generates `0`).

2. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop will iterate over values of `j` starting from 0 up to `i-1`.
   - Since `i` is 1, `j` will take the value 0 during the first iteration of the loop.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `dp[1]` is already set to `cakes[1][0]`.
   - `dp[2]` is already defined as the maximum value of `dp[1] + cakes[2][0]` or `dp[2] + cakes[2][0]`.
   - For `k` in the range `2` to `n-1`, `dp[k+1]` is precomputed based on the previous values of `dp` and `cakes`.

### Conclusion
Given the initial state and the loop condition, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

- `i` must be greater than 0.
- `j` must be 0 for the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the required state adjustments are:
- `i` is 1 (already given).
- `j` must be 0 for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 1, `j` must be 0**
