The code `min_length += min_speed` updates the value of `min_length` by adding the value of `min_speed` to it. Let's analyze the impact:

- `min_speed` is defined as \(\min(M + d, \text{max_speed})\).
- `max_length` is the original value of `max_length` plus \(2 \times \text{max_speed}\).
- `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed` are defined as \(\max(\text{max_speed} - d, M)\).
- `max_length`, `min_length` is `max_length + \min(M + d, \text{max_speed})`.
- `i` is 2.

Given these definitions, we can calculate the updated value of `min_length`:

- Initially, `min_length` is `max_length + \min(M + d, \text{max_speed})`.
- After executing `min_length += min_speed`, `min_length` becomes `max_length + \min(M + d, \text{max_speed}) + \min(M + d, \text{max_speed})`.

So, the new value of `min_length` is `max_length + 2 \times \min(M + d, \text{max_speed})`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`min_length` is `max_length + 2 \times \min(M + d, \text{max_speed})`; `max_length` is the original value of `max_length` plus \(2 \times \text{max\_speed}\); `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed` is \(\max(\text{max\_speed} - d, M)\); `i` is 2.**
