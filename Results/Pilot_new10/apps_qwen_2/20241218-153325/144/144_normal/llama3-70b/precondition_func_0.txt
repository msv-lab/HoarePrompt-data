The function takes no input parameters. The input consists of two lines read from standard input: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array.
