#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The input consists of two lines read from standard input: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    mex = 1
    for num in arr:
        if num == mex:
            mex += 1
        elif num > mex:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`.
    print(mex)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer \( n \) and an array of \( n \) integers from standard input. It then sorts the array and calculates the smallest positive integer (Mexican Hat or Mex) that is not present in the array. The function prints this integer to standard output and does not return any value. The function handles edge cases such as when the array is empty or contains only positive integers starting from 1 up to a certain point. If the array contains all integers from 1 to \( n \), the function correctly identifies \( n+1 \) as the Mex. However, it does not handle the case where the input might contain non-integer or non-positive values, which would result in incorrect behavior.
