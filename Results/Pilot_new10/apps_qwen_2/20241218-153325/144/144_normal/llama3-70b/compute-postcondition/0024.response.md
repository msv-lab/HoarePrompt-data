The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from standard input where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. Based on the input, the function processes the array but does not return anything explicitly.

However, following the given format and understanding that the function does not return anything explicitly in the function signature, we can describe the functionality as:

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers from standard input, processes the array, but does not return any value.**
