`arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The value of `n` remains the same as the integer input from the first line of standard input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), and the `arr` list is updated to be sorted. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer input from the first line of standard input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000); `arr` is a sorted list of integers from the second line of standard input.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the first line of standard input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000); `arr` is a sorted list of integers from the second line of standard input**
