Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the sorted list `arr`.
- If the current element `num` in `arr` is equal to `mex`, then `mex` is incremented by 1.
- If the current element `num` in `arr` is greater than `mex`, the loop breaks.

After the loop completes all iterations:
- `mex` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in `arr`. This is because the loop continues to increment `mex` until it finds an element in `arr` that is greater than `mex`, indicating that `mex` is missing from the list.
- Since the list `arr` is initially provided and remains unchanged during the loop, its state will be the same as its initial state.
- The integer `n` is also unaffected by the loop and will retain its initial value.

Thus, the final state of the variables is determined by the smallest positive integer that is not present in the sorted list `arr`.
