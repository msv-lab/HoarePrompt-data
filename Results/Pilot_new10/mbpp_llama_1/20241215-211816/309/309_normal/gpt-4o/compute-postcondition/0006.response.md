The code provided simply returns `False`, which is a boolean value indicating a false condition. This return statement does not depend on the values of `s`, `first_char`, or `char`. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `first_char` is `s[0]`, which means it's the first character of the string `s`.
- The initial value of `char` is `s[0]` (or the same as `first_char`), but the current value of `char` is not equal to `first_char`. This implies `char` has been modified to be different from the first character of `s`.

However, these details about `s`, `first_char`, and `char` do not affect the return statement, as it explicitly returns `False` regardless of their values.

Output State: **The program returns False**
