According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with at least two characters, `first_char` is `s[0]`, `char` is `s[1]`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 3 characters and `char` must be `s[2]`. The state of `first_char` remains unchanged as it is always `s[0]`. 
State: **`s` is a string with at least three characters, `first_char` is `s[0]`, `char` is `s[2]`**
