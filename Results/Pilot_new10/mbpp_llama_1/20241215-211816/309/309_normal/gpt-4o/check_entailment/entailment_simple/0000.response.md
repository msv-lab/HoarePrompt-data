Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function checks if the input string `s` is empty. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string are the same (since there are no characters). This is a valid base case.

2. If the string is not empty, the function stores the first character of the string in the variable `first_char`.

3. The function then iterates over each character in the string. If it finds a character that is not equal to `first_char`, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all characters in the string are the same.

4. If the function iterates over the entire string without finding any characters that are not equal to `first_char`, it returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string are the same.

This logic correctly implements the problem description, which requires the function to check whether all characters in a given string are the same.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function:

- `func_1('python')` returns `False` because not all characters in the string "python" are the same.
- `func_1('aaa')` returns `True` because all characters in the string "aaa" are the same.
- `func_1('data')` returns `False` because not all characters in the string "data" are the same.

Overall, the function behaves as expected and correctly implements the problem description, so its correctness is `True`.
