You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(s)` checks whether all the characters in a string `s` are the same or not. It uses the `set()` function to remove duplicate characters from the string. If all characters are the same, the set will contain only one character, and its length will be 1.

This function works correctly for all potential cases:

- If the string is empty, `len(set(s))` will return 0, which is not equal to 1, indicating that the function considers an empty string as not having all characters the same.
- If the string has one unique character, `len(set(s))` will return 1, indicating that all characters are the same.
- If the string has multiple unique characters, `len(set(s))` will return a value greater than 1, indicating that not all characters are the same.

The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It correctly handles strings with any number of characters, including empty strings, and strings with any combination of characters.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all characters in string `s` are the same, False otherwise


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
