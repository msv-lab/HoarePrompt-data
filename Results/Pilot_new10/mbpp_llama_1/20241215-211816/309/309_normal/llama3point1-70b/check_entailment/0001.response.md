Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(s)` checks whether all the characters in a string `s` are the same or not. It uses the `set()` function to remove duplicate characters from the string. If all characters are the same, the set will contain only one character, and its length will be 1.

This function works correctly for all potential cases:

- If the string is empty, `len(set(s))` will return 0, which is not equal to 1, indicating that the function considers an empty string as not having all characters the same.
- If the string has one unique character, `len(set(s))` will return 1, indicating that all characters are the same.
- If the string has multiple unique characters, `len(set(s))` will return a value greater than 1, indicating that not all characters are the same.

The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It correctly handles strings with any number of characters, including empty strings, and strings with any combination of characters.
