Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not check for the case where the input string `s` might be `None` or a non-string type. The function will throw an error when trying to convert `None` or a non-string type into a set. Additionally, it will fail when the input string `s` is an empty string because the function will return `True` for an empty string (since the length of the set of an empty string is 0, which equals 1 is `False` but it assumes the string is not empty), but the problem description implies that the function should return `False` for an empty string (or handle it explicitly) because "all characters are the same" does not apply to an empty string.

However, a case where it is not working as expected, for instance, when the string `s` is `None` and when the function throws an error instead of returning `False` because there are no characters to check if they are the same.

It seems like the code provided does handle correctly strings with all the same character and those with different characters. The issue, however, is that the function should handle all possible inputs, including `None` and empty strings. 

If we modify the code slightly, this could be handled, for example:
```python
def func_1(s):
    if not isinstance(s, str) or len(s) == 0:
        return False
    return len(set(s)) == 1
```
