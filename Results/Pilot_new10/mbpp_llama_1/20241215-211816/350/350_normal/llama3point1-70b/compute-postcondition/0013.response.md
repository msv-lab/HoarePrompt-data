The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `arr` and a `target` element. It iterates over the list in reverse order and returns the index of the `target` if found. If the `target` is not found, it returns -1. 

Upon closer examination of the code, it appears that the function will return the index of the last occurrence of the `target` in the list, not just any specific position as mentioned in the annotations. The code does not discriminate between different indices where the target might be found; it simply returns the first index it encounters while iterating in reverse order, which will be the last occurrence of the target in the list.

The annotations also mention specific cases where the function returns the last index, second last index, or third last index of the sorted list `arr`, but this is not accurate. The function's behavior is not dependent on these specific indices but rather on the position of the `target` in the list.

The function handles the case where the target is not found in the list by returning -1 after iterating over the entire list without finding a match.

In terms of edge cases, if the input list `arr` is empty, the function will not throw an error but will simply return -1, indicating that the target is not found.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and a `target` element, then returns the index of the last occurrence of the `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise returns -1, handling the case where the target is not present or the list is empty **
