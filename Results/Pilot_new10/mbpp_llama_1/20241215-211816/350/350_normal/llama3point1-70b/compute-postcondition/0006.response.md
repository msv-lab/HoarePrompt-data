Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements with at least 2 elements, `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`, and `i` is the second last index of `arr`. If `arr` at index `i` equals `target`, the function returns the second last index `i` of `arr`. If `arr` at index `i` does not equal `target`, no specific action is taken, maintaining the original state of `arr`, `target`, and `i`.**
