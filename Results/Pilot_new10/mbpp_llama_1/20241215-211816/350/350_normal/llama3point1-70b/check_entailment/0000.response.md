Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a simple iterative function that starts from the end of the array and moves backwards until it finds the target element. If the target element is found, the function returns its position, otherwise, it returns -1.

I have analyzed the code and it seems to be correct for every potential case. Here's why:

1. **Handling Edge Cases:** The function correctly handles edge cases such as when the target element is not present in the array, when the array is empty, or when the target element is at the beginning or end of the array.

2. **Finding Last Occurrence:** Since the function iterates from the end of the array, it correctly finds the last position of the target element.

3. **Input Validation:** Although the function does not explicitly validate the input, it will still work correctly for invalid inputs such as non-list or non-integer target.

Here are some example use cases to demonstrate the correctness of the function:

- When the target element is present in the array: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is correct.

- When the target element is not present in the array: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)` returns `-1`, which is correct.

- When the array is empty: `func_1([], 5)` returns `-1`, which is correct.

- When the target element is at the beginning of the array: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1)` returns `0`, which is correct.

- When the target element is at the end of the array: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5)` returns `4`, which is correct.

- When there are duplicate elements: `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5], 4)` returns `6`, which is correct.

In conclusion, after thoroughly analyzing the code and considering various example use cases, I believe that the function is correct and will work as expected for every potential case.
