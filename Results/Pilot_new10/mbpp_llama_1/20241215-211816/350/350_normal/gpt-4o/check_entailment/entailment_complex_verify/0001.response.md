Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array by iterating through the array in reverse order.

The annotated version of the code further confirms the correctness of the function. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program before and after the function call, as well as the behavior of the function when the target element is found or not found.

The function's approach of starting from the end of the array and returning the index of the first occurrence of the target element (which is the last occurrence due to the reverse iteration) is correct. The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function.

One potential issue that could be raised is that the function does not handle the case where the input array is empty. However, according to the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, this is not considered a problem.

Overall, the original assessment is accurate, and the annotated version of the code confirms the correctness of the function.

Final: **True**
