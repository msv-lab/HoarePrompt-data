Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is correct and meets the requirements described in the problem. It successfully finds the last position of an element in a sorted array.

Here's why the code is correct:

- The function iterates through the array in reverse order using a for loop, starting from the last element (`len(arr) - 1`) down to the first element (`-1`).
- As soon as it encounters the target element `x`, it immediately returns the index `i` of that element.
- If the target element is not found in the array after iterating through all elements, the function returns `-1`.

This approach ensures that the function returns the last occurrence of the target element in the sorted array because it starts searching from the end.

All the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) pass successfully, which further confirms the correctness of the function.

No cases were found where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
