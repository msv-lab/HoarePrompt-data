The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `arr` and an element `x` as parameters. According to the annotated code, it iterates through the list in reverse order and returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` that it finds. If `x` is not found in the list, or if the list is empty, it returns -1.

However, the return postconditions suggest specific cases where the function returns the index of the last, second last, or third last element of `arr`, but the code does not support these claims. In reality, the function will return the index of `x` as soon as it finds a match while iterating from the end of the list, regardless of whether `x` is the last, second last, or third last element.

The annotations also mention that the function returns the index of `x` if it matches the last, second last, or third last element of `arr`, but this is not entirely accurate. The function will return the index of `x` as long as it is found in the list, not just if it is one of the last three elements.

Therefore, considering the actual code, the functionality of the function is to search for the element `x` in the sorted list `arr` from the end towards the beginning and return its index if found. If `x` is not found in `arr`, or if `arr` is empty, the function returns -1.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and an element `x`, and returns the index of `x` if it is found in `arr` while iterating from the end towards the beginning; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that `x` was not found in `arr` or `arr` is empty. **
