To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the provided Python code snippet.

Given:
- `arr` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements.
- `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`.
- `i` is set to the second last index of `arr`.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
return i
```

Since `i` is set to the second last index of `arr`, and we know `arr` has at least 2 elements, `i` will always be a valid index within `arr`. The value of `x` does not affect the determination of `i` because `i` is derived from the structure of `arr` itself, not from its contents or the presence of a specific element like `x`.

Therefore, when the program returns `i`, it returns the index of the second last element in the sorted list `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the index of the second last element in the sorted list `arr`.**
