According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `arr`. The loop iterates over the indices of `arr` in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is set to the last index of `arr`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, because the loop iterates in reverse order. So, `i` should be set to the second last index of `arr`. 

Since `arr` must have at least 1 element and `i` is set to the last index of `arr` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 2 elements. 

The state of `x` does not affect the execution of the loop, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, `i` is set to the second last index of `arr`**
