You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` seems to correctly implement the described functionality. It rounds each number in the input list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list.

The function uses a list comprehension to round each number in the list, which is a concise and efficient way to perform this operation. The built-in `sum` function is then used to calculate the total sum of the rounded numbers. Finally, the result is multiplied by the length of the input list, which is obtained using the `len` function.

The provided unit tests also suggest that the function behaves correctly for various inputs, including lists with positive and negative numbers, as well as lists with a mix of integers and floating-point numbers.

To further verify the correctness of the function, one can consider additional test cases, such as:

* An empty list: `func_1([])` should raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to multiply by the length of the list, which is zero.
* A list with a single element: `func_1([5.5])` should return the rounded value multiplied by 1, which is 6.
* A list with very large or very small numbers: `func_1([1e10, 2e-10])` should return the correct result, taking into account the rounding of these numbers.

Since the function handles these edge cases correctly and there are no obvious errors in the implementation, it can be concluded that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers. It returns 0 for an empty list but does not handle lists with non-numeric values, potentially resulting in a TypeError.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
