The original assessment states that the program is correct, which means it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. However, the annotated version of the code points out that the function does not handle lists with non-numeric values, potentially resulting in a TypeError. 

Moreover, the function is supposed to print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list but instead, it returns the result. This discrepancy between the problem description and the actual implementation of the function suggests that the original assessment may not be entirely accurate.

Additionally, the annotated version mentions that the function returns 0 for an empty list, but this behavior is not explicitly tested or mentioned in the problem description. While this might not be an issue given the assumption that the input will always be valid, it's still worth noting that the function does not explicitly handle this edge case.

Given these observations, the original assessment seems to be too optimistic. The function does meet the basic requirements but has some limitations and discrepancies with the problem description.

Final: **False**
