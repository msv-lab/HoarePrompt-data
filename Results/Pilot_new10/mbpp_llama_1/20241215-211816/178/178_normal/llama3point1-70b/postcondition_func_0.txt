The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers. If the list is empty, it returns 0. The function assumes all elements in the list are numeric and does not handle non-numeric values or potential overflow errors.
