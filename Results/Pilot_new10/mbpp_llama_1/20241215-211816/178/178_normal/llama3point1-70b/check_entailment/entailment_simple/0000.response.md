Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Rounding every number in the list:** The program uses a list comprehension to create a new list `rounded_numbers` where each number from the input list `numbers` is rounded to the nearest integer using the `round` function.

2. **Calculating the total sum:** The program then calculates the sum of these rounded numbers using the built-in `sum` function and stores it in the `total_sum` variable.

3. **Multiplying by the length of the list:** Finally, the program multiplies the `total_sum` by the length of the input list `numbers` (obtained using `len(numbers)`) and returns this product.

However, it's worth noting that the problem description asks the function to "print" the total sum multiplied by the length of the list, but the provided function returns this value instead of printing it. To perfectly match the problem description, the function should be modified to print the result instead of returning it. 

The corrected version would be:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    print(total_sum * len(numbers))
```

In its current form, if we strictly interpret the problem description as requiring the function to print the result, the program does not follow the instructions perfectly. But in terms of the mathematical operation described, it is correct. Therefore, considering the provided function does not exactly match the problem description due to the return vs print discrepancy, a more precise assessment would be:

Correctness: **False**

This is because the function does not print the result as specified in the problem description; it returns the result instead.
