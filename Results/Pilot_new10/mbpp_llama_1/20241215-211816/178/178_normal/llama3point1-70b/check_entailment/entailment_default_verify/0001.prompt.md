You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number in the list using the `round` function, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the length of the input list.

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's a breakdown:

1. It rounds every number in the given list using a list comprehension: `[round(num) for num in numbers]`.
2. It calculates the sum of these rounded numbers using the built-in `sum` function: `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)`.
3. It multiplies the total sum by the length of the input list: `return total_sum * len(numbers)`.

Considering various potential cases:

- **Empty list**: If an empty list is passed, the `sum` function will return 0 (since the sum of no numbers is 0), and `len(numbers)` will return 0, resulting in a return value of 0 * 0 = 0, which aligns with the mathematical interpretation of the operation on an empty set of numbers.
- **List with integers**: The `round` function will not change integer values, so the function behaves as expected by summing the integers and multiplying by the count of integers.
- **List with floats**: The `round` function will round each float to the nearest integer, and then the function proceeds as expected, summing these rounded values and multiplying by the count of floats.

Since the code handles all identified potential cases and edge cases correctly according to the problem description, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers. If the list is empty, it returns 0. The function assumes all elements in the list are numeric and does not handle non-numeric values or potential overflow errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
