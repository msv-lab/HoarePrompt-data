You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the length of the input list. 

Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list of numbers as input, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Rounding Numbers**: The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` correctly rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The `sum(rounded_numbers)` line correctly calculates the sum of the rounded numbers.

4. **Multiplication by List Length**: The product of the sum of rounded numbers and the length of the input list is calculated and returned.

Given these steps, the function performs exactly as the problem description requires. It rounds every number in the given list, calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list, returning the result.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to not work as described, assuming the input is a list of numbers. The function does not handle non-numeric inputs explicitly, but it will raise a TypeError if the list contains non-numeric values, which is a reasonable behavior for a function with a specific numeric input requirement. However, the problem description does not specify the behavior for non-numeric inputs, so in the context of the task (focusing strictly on lists of numbers), the function behaves correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers. If the list is empty, it returns 0. The function assumes all elements in the list are numeric and does not handle non-numeric values or potential overflow errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
