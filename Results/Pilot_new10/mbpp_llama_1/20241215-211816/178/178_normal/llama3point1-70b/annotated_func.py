#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of the sum of rounded numbers and the total count of numbers, where each rounded number is obtained by rounding the corresponding number in the list `numbers` to the nearest integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers. If the list is empty, it returns 0. The function assumes all elements in the list are numeric and does not handle non-numeric values or potential overflow errors.
