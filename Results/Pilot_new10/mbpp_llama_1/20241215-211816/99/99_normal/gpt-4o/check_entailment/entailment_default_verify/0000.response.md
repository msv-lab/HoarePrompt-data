The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**, which means it is believed to accurately solve the problem as described. Upon reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it's clear that the function `func_1` indeed removes characters at odd index values from a given string, adhering to zero-based indexing, where index 0 is considered even.

The code uses a list comprehension to select characters at even indices (`i % 2 == 0`) and joins them into a new string, which directly addresses the problem statement. The unit tests provided (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various strings, showing the expected output for each case.

The output hints further support the original assessment by noting that the function works as intended for strings of any length, including empty strings, and will return a string consisting of characters at even indices. Although the hints mention potential errors for non-string inputs or `None`, the problem description and the assumption of valid input (as stated) mean that these scenarios are outside the scope of the assessment.

Given this analysis, the output hints do not contradict the original assessment but rather reinforce it by describing the function's behavior in line with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness remains accurate.

Final: **True**
