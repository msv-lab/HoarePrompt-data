Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, effectively removes characters at odd index values from a given string, as required by the problem description. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over the string `s` and selects characters at indices where `i % 2 == 0`, which corresponds to even indices (0-based indexing). The selected characters are then joined back into a string using `''.join()`. 

The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings, without raising any errors for these cases, as demonstrated by the unit tests provided (e.g., `assert func_1('abcdef') == 'ace'`, `assert func_1('python') == 'pto'`, etc.). The output hints mention potential issues with non-string inputs or `None`, but these cases aren't directly related to the functionality described in the problem, which specifically asks for handling strings.

Given the function's implementation and the examples provided, there's no indication that it fails to meet the requirements for any potential string input. The function is designed to correctly process strings and has been tested with various string lengths and contents, all of which align with the expected behavior described in the problem statement. Therefore, based on the information provided and the strict format required for the response, the correctness of the function is considered to be true.
