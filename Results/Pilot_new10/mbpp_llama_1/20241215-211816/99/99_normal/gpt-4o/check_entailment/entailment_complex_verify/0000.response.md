The original assessment is None, which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness.

Looking at the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` seems to be correctly implemented. It uses list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the input string `s` and includes only the characters at even indices (0-based indexing) in the output string.

The annotated version of the code also confirms this, stating that the function returns a string consisting of characters from `s` that are at even indices.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1('abcdef') == 'ace'` and `assert func_1('python') == 'pto'`, also support the correctness of the function.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations, I believe the program is correct.

Final: **True**
