The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters at odd index values from a given string. The function utilizes a generator expression to iterate over the string `s` with a step of 2, effectively selecting only the characters at even index positions. 

This is in line with the problem description, which requires the function to remove characters at odd indices. The output hints also confirm the correctness of the function, stating that it handles all cases, including empty strings, single-character strings, and strings of varying lengths, and returns a new string consisting of characters from `s` that are at even indices.

The original assessment correctly explains the function's behavior, highlighting the zero-based indexing of strings in Python and the use of the `range(0, len(s), 2)` function to generate indices starting from 0 up to `len(s)` with a step size of 2, thereby skipping characters at odd index positions.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate, and the function is considered correct.

Final: **True**
