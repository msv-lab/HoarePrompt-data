Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function in Python. The output hints agree with the code and state that the function returns the Unicode point for the first character of the string. Since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, this is equivalent to the ASCII value for characters that have an ASCII representation. 

The function will raise an error if the input is empty, as there is no character to get the ASCII value from. This is consistent with the output hints, which state that a TypeError is raised if the string is empty.

For every potential case, such as when the input is a single character, the function should return the correct ASCII value. For example, `func_1('a')` will return `97`, which is the ASCII value of 'a'. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, it appears that the code is correct and should work for all potential cases.
