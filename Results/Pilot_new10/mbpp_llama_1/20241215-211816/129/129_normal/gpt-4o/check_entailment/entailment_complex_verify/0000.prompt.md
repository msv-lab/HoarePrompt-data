You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in Python function `ord()` to find the ASCII value of a character. This function works correctly for all possible input characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

The `ord()` function returns an integer representing the Unicode character, and since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, it correctly returns the ASCII value for ASCII characters. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1('A') == 65`, `assert func_1('R') == 82`, and `assert func_1('S') == 83`, demonstrate the function's correctness for specific cases.

In general, for any input character `char`, `ord(char)` will return its corresponding ASCII value. This function does not have any edge cases where it fails to work as expected, making it correct according to the problem description. 

However, it's worth noting that this function does not include any error checking. If the input is not a single character, the function may not behave as expected. For example, if the input is a string of length greater than 1, or if the input is not a string at all, the function may raise an error or return an incorrect result. But based on the given unit tests and the problem description, the function seems to be correct. 

To make the function more robust, you could add error checking to ensure that the input is a single character. But based on the provided information, the function is correct as it is.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the Unicode value of the single character 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter and returns its Unicode value if it is a single character, but it may throw an error if the input is not a single character or not a string at all.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
