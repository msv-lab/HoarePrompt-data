Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided uses the built-in Python function `ord()` to return the Unicode value of a character. This function works correctly for any single character, regardless of whether it's an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit, or special character. The `ord()` function takes a single character as input and returns its corresponding Unicode value.

The unit tests provided in the problem description (`assert func_1('A') == 65`, `assert func_1('R') == 82`, `assert func_1('S') == 83`) all pass when using the `ord()` function, which further confirms its correctness.

While the output hints mention that the function may throw an error if the input is not a single character or not a string at all, the `ord()` function will indeed raise a `TypeError` if the input is not a string, or a `TypeError` if the string is not of length 1. However, since the problem description specifically asks for the ASCII value of a character and does not specify any error handling for invalid inputs, it can be assumed that the input will always be a single character. 

Therefore, the code works as expected according to the problem description, and there are no potential cases where it would not work correctly, assuming the input is always a single character.
