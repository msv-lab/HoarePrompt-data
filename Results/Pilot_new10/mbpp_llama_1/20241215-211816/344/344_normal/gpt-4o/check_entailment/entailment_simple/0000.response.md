Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order, which means finding the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

The provided function, `func_1`, uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

The `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the number of elements in the sorted list that are less than or equal to the given value, which is the correct index for insertion. The function handles both cases where the value is already present in the list (inserting after the existing value) and where the value is not present (inserting at the correct position to maintain sorted order).

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function for different scenarios, including inserting before, after, and at the end of the sorted list.

In general, the `bisect` module is designed for binary search and insertion in sorted lists, and `bisect.bisect_right` specifically returns the insertion point that maintains sorted order, making it a suitable implementation for the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
