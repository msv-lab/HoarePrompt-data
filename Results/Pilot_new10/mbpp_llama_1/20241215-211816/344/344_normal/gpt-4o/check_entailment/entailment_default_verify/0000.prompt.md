You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program uses the `bisect` module's `bisect_right` function to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The `bisect_right` function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different scenarios:

- When the value is greater than all elements in the list, the function returns the length of the list, which is the correct insertion point.
- When the value is between two elements in the list, the function returns the index of the larger element, which is the correct insertion point to maintain the sorted order.
- When the value is greater than the largest element in the list, the function returns the length of the list, which is the correct insertion point.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, it appears that the function works correctly for all possible scenarios, including:

- An empty list: Although not explicitly tested, `bisect.bisect_right` will return 0 for an empty list, which is the correct insertion point for any value.
- A list with duplicate elements: The function will return the index of the first occurrence of the value if it already exists in the list, or the index where it should be inserted if it does not exist.
- A list with negative numbers or zero: The function will work correctly with negative numbers and zero, as the `bisect` module's comparison is based on the numerical values of the elements.

Since no potential case has been found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a sorted list and a value, and returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which is the number of elements in the list that are strictly less than the given value. The function assumes the input list is sorted and the value is comparable with the list elements, and it handles edge cases such as an empty list or a value outside the range of the list elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
