The original assessment was "None", which means there was no initial judgment made about the program's correctness.

After examining the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, we can see that the function `func_1` uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list.

The annotated version of the code explains that the function returns the index where the `value` should be inserted in `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order, which is the number of elements in `sorted_list` that are less than or equal to `value`. However, it also mentions that the function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which is the number of elements in the list that are strictly less than the given value. This seems to be a contradiction.

Upon closer inspection, we can see that `bisect.bisect_right` actually returns the index where the `value` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which is the number of elements in `sorted_list` that are strictly less than the given value.

The provided unit tests also support this, as they check that the function returns the correct index for different scenarios.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
