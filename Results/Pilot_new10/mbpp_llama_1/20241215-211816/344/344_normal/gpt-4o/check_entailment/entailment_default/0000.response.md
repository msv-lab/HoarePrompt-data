Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from Python's built-in `bisect` module, which returns the index where the given value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. This function is specifically designed to handle such cases, including edge cases like an empty list or a value outside the range of the list elements.

The function `func_1` directly returns the result of `bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)`, which means it correctly identifies the right insertion point for the specified value in the sorted list. The `bisect.bisect_right` function is inclusive of equal elements, meaning if the value already exists in the list, it returns the index of the rightmost occurrence of that value plus one, effectively indicating where a new occurrence of that value should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

Given the provided assertions and understanding of how `bisect.bisect_right` works, the code accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement. For every potential case, including edge cases like inserting at the beginning, middle, or end of the list, or handling duplicate values, the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
