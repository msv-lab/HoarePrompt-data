The function accepts a sorted list and a value, and returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which is the number of elements in the list that are strictly less than the given value. The function assumes the input list is sorted and the value is comparable with the list elements, and it handles edge cases such as an empty list or a value outside the range of the list elements.
