#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a sorted list of elements, and value is an element that can be compared with the elements in sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` remains a sorted list of elements, `value` remains an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, and the function either returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value` or returns `None` if no such element is found.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the number of elements in the sorted list 'sorted_list'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list and a value, returning the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the given value. If no such element is found, it returns the total number of elements in the list, effectively handling cases where the value exceeds all elements in the list or when the input list is empty.
