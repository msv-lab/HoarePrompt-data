The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list` and `value`. `sorted_list` is a sorted list of elements, and `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`. After executing the function body, the function returns different values based on the following conditions: 
Case_1: The function returns index `i` which is 0, indicating the position in `sorted_list` where the value at that index is greater than or equal to the given `value`. 
Case_2: The function returns 1. 
Case_3: The function returns 2. 
Case_4: The function returns the number of elements in the sorted list 'sorted_list'. 
Since these cases are mutually exclusive, only one of them will be fulfilled, and the function will return the corresponding value. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list and a value, and returns either the index where the value is greater than or equal to the given value, or specific integers (1 or 2), or the total number of elements in the list.**
