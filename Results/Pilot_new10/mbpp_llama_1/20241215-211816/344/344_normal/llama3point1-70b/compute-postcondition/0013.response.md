The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value `value`. It iterates over the list to find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the given `value`. If such an element is found, the function returns its index. If no such element is found after iterating over the entire list, the function returns the length of the `sorted_list`, which represents the number of elements in the list.

Upon reviewing the code, it's clear that the return postconditions provided (Case_1 to Case_4) are somewhat misleading, as they do not accurately reflect the behavior of the function as described by the code itself. The code does not return specific integers like 1 or 2 based on any condition described in the return postconditions. Instead, it either returns the index of the first element greater than or equal to the given value or the length of the list if no such element is found.

The code does not handle the case where the input list is empty explicitly, but based on how Python handles ranges and list indices, if the list is empty, the for loop will not execute, and the function will return 0, which is the length of an empty list.

Given the code's logic, potential edge cases include an empty input list, a list with a single element, a list with duplicate elements, and a list where all elements are less than the given value. The function handles these cases by returning the length of the list when the value is greater than all elements in the list or when the list is empty.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a sorted list and a value, returning the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the given value. If no such element is found, it returns the total number of elements in the list, effectively handling cases where the value exceeds all elements in the list or when the input list is empty. **
