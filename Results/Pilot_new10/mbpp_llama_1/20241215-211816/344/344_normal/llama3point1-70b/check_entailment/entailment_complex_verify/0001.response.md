Based on the provided information, the original assessment is "None", which implies that there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness.

After examining the problem description, the original program, and the annotated version, I can conclude that the program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function returns the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the given value. If no such element is found, it returns the total number of elements in the list, effectively handling cases where the value exceeds all elements in the list or when the input list is empty.

The only potential issue is with the comment in the annotated code, which states that the function returns `None` if no such element is found. However, the code itself returns `len(sorted_list)`, not `None`, which is consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment of "None" does not provide any information about the correctness of the program. However, based on the provided code and annotations, I believe that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
