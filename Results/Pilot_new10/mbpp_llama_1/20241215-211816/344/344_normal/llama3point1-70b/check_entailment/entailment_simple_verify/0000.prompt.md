You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It iterates through the list and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such element is found, it returns the length of the list, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.

This approach works because the list is sorted, so any element greater than the specified value will be to its right, and any element less than the specified value will be to its left. The function returns the first index where the element is greater than or equal to the specified value, which is where the specified value should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

For example, if the sorted list is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` and the specified value is `6`, the function will return `3`, which is the correct insertion point. If the specified value is `10`, the function will return `5`, which is also correct.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program handles edge cases, such as when the specified value is less than the smallest element in the list or greater than the largest element in the list, correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a sorted list of elements, and value is an element that can be compared with the elements in sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` remains a sorted list of elements, `value` remains an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, and the function either returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value` or returns `None` if no such element is found.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the number of elements in the sorted list 'sorted_list'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
