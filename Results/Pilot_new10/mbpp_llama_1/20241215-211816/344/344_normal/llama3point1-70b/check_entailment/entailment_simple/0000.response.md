Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value `value` as input.
2. It iterates over the list using a for loop, checking each element to see if it's greater than or equal to the `value`.
3. If it finds such an element, it immediately returns the index `i` of that element. This index is the right insertion point for the `value` to maintain the sorted order of the list.
4. If the loop completes without finding an element greater than or equal to the `value`, it means the `value` is greater than all elements in the list. In this case, the function returns the length of the list, which is the correct insertion point to maintain the sorted order.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

- If the `value` is less than the smallest element in the list, the function will return 0, which is the correct insertion point.
- If the `value` is equal to an element in the list, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of that element, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.
- If the `value` is greater than the largest element in the list, the function will return the length of the list, which is the correct insertion point.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description by finding the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list.
