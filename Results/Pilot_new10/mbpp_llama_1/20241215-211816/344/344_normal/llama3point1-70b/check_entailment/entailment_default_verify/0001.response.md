The original assessment is "None", which implies that no initial assessment of the program's correctness was provided. 

Upon reviewing the problem description, the code, and the output hints, it appears that the function `func_1` is correctly implemented to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The code iterates through the sorted list and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the given value. If no such element is found, it returns the total number of elements in the list, effectively handling cases where the value exceeds all elements in the list or when the input list is empty.

The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the given value, or the total number of elements in the list if no such element is found. 

Given this information, it seems that the original assessment was not provided, but the code and output hints suggest that the function is correctly implemented. 

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
