Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it appears that the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list.

The function iterates through the list and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the given value. If no such element is found, it returns the total number of elements in the list, effectively handling cases where the value exceeds all elements in the list or when the input list is empty.

The output hints also confirm this behavior, stating that the function accepts a sorted list and a value, returning the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the given value. If no such element is found, it returns the total number of elements in the list.

Therefore, I see no reason to dispute the original assessment, as the code and output hints match the problem description.

Final: **True**
