Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function iterates through the sorted list using a for loop, checking each element to see if it is greater than or equal to the given value.
2. If it finds an element that meets this condition, it immediately returns the index of that element, which is the correct insertion point for the value to maintain the sorted order.
3. If the loop completes without finding an element greater than or equal to the value, it means the value is greater than all elements in the list. In this case, the function returns the length of the sorted list, which is equivalent to the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
4. This approach also handles the case where the input list is empty, as the function will return 0, which is the correct insertion point for any value in an empty list.

The key insight here is that the function is using the fact that the input list is sorted to efficiently locate the insertion point. By returning the index of the first element greater than or equal to the value, or the length of the list if no such element is found, the function ensures that the value can be inserted at the correct position to maintain the sorted order.

Overall, the program correctly implements the desired functionality, and it does so in a way that is efficient and easy to understand.
