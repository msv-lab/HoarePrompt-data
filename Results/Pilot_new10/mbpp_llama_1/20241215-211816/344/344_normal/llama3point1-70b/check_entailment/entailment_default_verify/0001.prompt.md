You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, appears to be a correct implementation of a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. 

Here's why:

1. **Correct Handling of Insertion Points**: For a sorted list, if we're looking for the insertion point of a new value, we should insert it at the first position where the existing element is greater than or equal to the new value. The function does this correctly by iterating through the list and returning the index `i` as soon as it finds `sorted_list[i] >= value`.

2. **Handling the End of the List**: If the value to be inserted is greater than all elements in the sorted list, the function correctly returns the length of the list, indicating that the new value should be appended to the end of the list.

3. **Handling Empty List**: If the `sorted_list` is empty, the function will return `0`, which is the correct insertion point for any value since the list is empty.

4. **Sorted List Assumption**: The function assumes that the input list is sorted, which is a requirement stated in the problem description. Under this assumption, the function works as expected.

Given that the function handles the start, middle, and end cases correctly, and accounts for an empty list scenario, and given the assumption that the input list is sorted, the function appears to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the function is confirmed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a sorted list and a value, returning the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the given value. If no such element is found, it returns the total number of elements in the list, effectively handling cases where the value exceeds all elements in the list or when the input list is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
