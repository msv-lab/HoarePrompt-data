Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, appears to be a correct implementation of a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. 

Here's why:

1. **Correct Handling of Insertion Points**: For a sorted list, if we're looking for the insertion point of a new value, we should insert it at the first position where the existing element is greater than or equal to the new value. The function does this correctly by iterating through the list and returning the index `i` as soon as it finds `sorted_list[i] >= value`.

2. **Handling the End of the List**: If the value to be inserted is greater than all elements in the sorted list, the function correctly returns the length of the list, indicating that the new value should be appended to the end of the list.

3. **Handling Empty List**: If the `sorted_list` is empty, the function will return `0`, which is the correct insertion point for any value since the list is empty.

4. **Sorted List Assumption**: The function assumes that the input list is sorted, which is a requirement stated in the problem description. Under this assumption, the function works as expected.

Given that the function handles the start, middle, and end cases correctly, and accounts for an empty list scenario, and given the assumption that the input list is sorted, the function appears to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the function is confirmed.
