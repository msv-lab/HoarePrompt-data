You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, appears to be a correct implementation of a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. 

Here's why:

1. **Correct Handling of Insertion Points**: For a sorted list, if we're looking for the insertion point of a new value, we should insert it at the first position where the existing element is greater than or equal to the new value. The function does this correctly by iterating through the list and returning the index `i` as soon as it finds `sorted_list[i] >= value`.

2. **Handling the End of the List**: If the value to be inserted is greater than all elements in the sorted list, the function correctly returns the length of the list, indicating that the new value should be appended to the end of the list.

3. **Handling Empty List**: If the `sorted_list` is empty, the function will return `0`, which is the correct insertion point for any value since the list is empty.

4. **Sorted List Assumption**: The function assumes that the input list is sorted, which is a requirement stated in the problem description. Under this assumption, the function works as expected.

Given that the function handles the start, middle, and end cases correctly, and accounts for an empty list scenario, and given the assumption that the input list is sorted, the function appears to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the function is confirmed.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a sorted list of elements, and value is an element that can be compared with the elements in sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` remains a sorted list of elements, `value` remains an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, and the function either returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value` or returns `None` if no such element is found.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the number of elements in the sorted list 'sorted_list'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
