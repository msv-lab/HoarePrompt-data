Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, it can be concluded that the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`.

The code uses a dictionary comprehension, which is a straightforward and efficient way to achieve the desired functionality. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program for different input scenarios.

The annotated version of the code does not reveal any potential issues or inconsistencies with the original assessment. It accurately describes the state of the program before the function call and the expected return value.

Since we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors, the program does not need to handle edge cases such as an empty dictionary or invalid input types. The original assessment correctly identifies that the program handles all potential cases correctly, including when the input dictionary is empty or when all values are less than `n`.

Therefore, based on all the available information, it can be concluded that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
