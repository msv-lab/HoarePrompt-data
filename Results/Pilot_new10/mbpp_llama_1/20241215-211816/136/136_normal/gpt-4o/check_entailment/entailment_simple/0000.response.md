Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It filters the input dictionary `d` to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. This is achieved through the dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}`, which iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary and only includes the pair in the resulting dictionary if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program for different scenarios. For example, the first test case checks that the function correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to 170. The second and third test cases verify that the function behaves as expected when the threshold value `n` is increased to 180 and 190, respectively.

The program's correctness can be attributed to the following reasons:

1. **Dictionary comprehension**: The program uses a dictionary comprehension, which is a concise and efficient way to create a new dictionary by iterating over an existing dictionary and applying a condition to each key-value pair.
2. **Correct condition**: The condition `v >= n` is applied to each value `v` in the dictionary, ensuring that only entries with values greater than or equal to `n` are included in the resulting dictionary.
3. **Comprehensive unit tests**: The provided unit tests cover a range of scenarios, demonstrating the program's correctness for different inputs and edge cases.

In summary, the program correctly filters the input dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`, making it a valid solution to the problem described.
