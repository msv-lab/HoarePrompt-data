Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as input and returns a new dictionary containing only the entries from `d` with values greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the entries, which is a concise and efficient way to achieve this.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

*   When the input dictionary is empty, the function returns an empty dictionary, which is the expected behavior.
*   When all values in the dictionary are less than `n`, the function returns an empty dictionary, which is the expected behavior.
*   When all values in the dictionary are greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns the original dictionary, which is the expected behavior.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program for different input scenarios. Since we cannot find a single case where the program does not work correctly, we can conclude that the program is correct.
