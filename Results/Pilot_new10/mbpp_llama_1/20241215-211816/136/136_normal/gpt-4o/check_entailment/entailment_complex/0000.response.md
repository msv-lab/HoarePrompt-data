Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as input, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This is achieved through a dictionary comprehension that iterates over the items in `d` and includes only those where the value meets the condition.

The program correctly handles the cases specified in the problem description, as demonstrated by the provided assertions. For example, when the input dictionary is `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` and `n` is `170`, the function returns `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which are the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `170`.

The program also correctly handles cases where `n` is equal to a value in the dictionary, as demonstrated by the assertion where `n` is `180` and the function returns `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`.

However, it's worth noting that the program does not explicitly handle edge cases such as empty dictionaries, non-integer values, negative or zero `n`, or `None` inputs, which may result in unexpected behavior or errors. But based on the provided problem description and assertions, the program is correct for the specified inputs and requirements. 

In general, to make this function more robust, you might want to add some error checking code to handle these edge cases. For example, you could add checks to ensure that `d` is a dictionary, `n` is an integer, and that all values in `d` are integers. But for the purposes of this problem, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
