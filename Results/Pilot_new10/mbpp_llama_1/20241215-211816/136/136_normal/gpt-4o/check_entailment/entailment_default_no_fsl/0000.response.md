Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. For example, it does not check if the input dictionary `d` is actually a dictionary or if the input integer `n` is actually an integer. It also does not handle edge cases such as empty dictionaries, non-integer values, negative or zero `n`, or `None` inputs.

A specific example where the program does not work correctly is when the input dictionary contains non-integer values, such as strings or floats. In this case, the program will throw an error when it tries to compare the value to `n` using the `>=` operator.

For instance, if we call `func_1({'Cierra Vega': '175', 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 170)`, the program will throw an error because it cannot compare the string `'175'` to the integer `170`.

Additionally, if we pass `None` as the input dictionary or integer, the program will also throw an error. For example, calling `func_1(None, 170)` or `func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, None)` will result in an error.

To fix these issues, the program should include error checking code to handle these edge cases and ensure that the inputs are valid before attempting to filter the dictionary.
