Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` filters a dictionary `d` to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the integer `n`. The given unit tests and the output hints agree with the code.

The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}` correctly iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary `d` and includes the pair in the new dictionary if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. This approach handles all edge cases, including empty dictionaries, non-integer values are implicitly handled as they are excluded by the condition `v >= n`, and negative or zero `n` values are handled as expected.

The only possible edge case that could be considered is when the input dictionary `d` is `None`, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. However, even in this case, the code would raise a `TypeError`, which might be considered the expected behavior for an invalid input.

In general, the code seems to be correct and robust, and it should work as expected for all valid inputs.
