The function accepts a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`, handling edge cases such as empty dictionaries and negative `n` values, but may raise an error if `d` contains non-comparable values.
