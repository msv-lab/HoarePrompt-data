#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`, handling edge cases such as empty dictionaries and negative `n` values, but may raise an error if `d` contains non-comparable values.
