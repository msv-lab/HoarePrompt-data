Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(d, n)` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as input and returns a new dictionary that includes only the entries from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This function uses dictionary comprehension to filter the dictionary.

Here's why the code is correct:

- It correctly handles dictionaries with mixed data types (e.g., strings, integers, floats) as values, but it will only work as expected if the values are comparable with `n` using the `>=` operator.
- It correctly handles empty dictionaries by returning an empty dictionary.
- It correctly handles cases where `n` is greater than all values in the dictionary, returning an empty dictionary.
- It correctly handles cases where `n` is less than or equal to all values in the dictionary, returning a dictionary with all entries from the original dictionary.
- It does not modify the original dictionary, creating a new one instead, which is often a desirable behavior to avoid side effects.

The function does not have any explicit error checking for edge cases such as a non-dictionary input for `d` or a non-integer input for `n`. However, based on the problem description provided, the primary focus is on filtering the dictionary based on the given condition, and the function achieves this correctly assuming that the inputs are of the expected types (dictionary and integer). 

For example, if `d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}` and `n = 2`, the function will correctly return `{'b': 2, 'c': 3}`. 

Therefore, given the strict focus on the task of filtering a dictionary based on a threshold value without explicit mention of error handling for type mismatches, the function works as described.
