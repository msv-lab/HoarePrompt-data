You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n.
Program:
```
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}` iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary `d` and only includes the pair in the new dictionary if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.

This program handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty dictionaries: The function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
* Dictionaries with no values greater than or equal to `n`: The function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
* Dictionaries with all values greater than or equal to `n`: The function will return a copy of the original dictionary, which is the expected result.
* Dictionaries with a mix of values greater than or equal to `n` and values less than `n`: The function will return a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`, which is the expected result.

The function also correctly handles non-integer values and non-numeric values in the dictionary, although the problem description does not specify how these cases should be handled. In Python, attempting to compare a non-numeric value to an integer using `>=` will raise a TypeError. If the problem description intended to specify that the dictionary should only contain numeric values, the function may need to be modified to handle or raise an error for non-numeric values. However, based on the provided problem description, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`, handling edge cases such as empty dictionaries and negative `n` values, but may raise an error if `d` contains non-comparable values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
