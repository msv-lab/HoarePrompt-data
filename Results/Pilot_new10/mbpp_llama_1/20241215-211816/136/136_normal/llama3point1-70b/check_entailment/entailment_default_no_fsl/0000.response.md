Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` filters a dictionary `d` to only include entries with values greater than or equal to an integer `n`, which aligns with the problem description. However, the code does not handle all edge cases as implied by the output hints.

A specific case where the program does not work as expected is when the dictionary `d` contains non-comparable values (e.g., strings and integers). For instance, if `d = {'a': 1, 'b': '2'}` and `n = 1`, the function will raise a `TypeError` when trying to compare the string `'2'` with the integer `1`, because it attempts to compare these values directly in the condition `v >= n`.

To fully meet the requirements, the function should either explicitly handle such non-comparable values (by raising a meaningful error or by implementing a comparison logic that can handle different data types) or ensure through input validation that only comparable values are processed. Without such handling, the function is not correct for every potential case, as it may fail unexpectedly with certain inputs.
