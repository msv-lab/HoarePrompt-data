Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. 

The function achieves this by using Python's list slicing feature. The expression `list1[:-1]` returns a new list that includes all elements in `list1` except the last one. This new list is then concatenated with `list2` using the `+` operator, effectively replacing the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])` returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`, which is the expected result.

It's worth noting that the problem description only specifies the behavior for non-empty `list1`. However, the function also handles the case where `list1` is empty correctly, as it simply returns a copy of `list2` in this case. 

The only potential issue could be if the problem description intended for the function to modify the original `list1` instead of returning a new list. However, the provided unit tests and the overall context of the problem description suggest that returning a new list is the intended behavior.
