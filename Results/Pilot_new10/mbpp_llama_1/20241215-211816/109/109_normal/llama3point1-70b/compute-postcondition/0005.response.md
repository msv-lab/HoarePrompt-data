Given that list1 and list2 are lists and list1 is not empty, the code provided returns list1. Since list1's last element is replaced by the elements of list2, list1 will now contain all its original elements except the last one, which is replaced by all elements of list2.

Output State: **The program returns list1, which contains all its original elements except the last one, replaced by all elements of list2.**
