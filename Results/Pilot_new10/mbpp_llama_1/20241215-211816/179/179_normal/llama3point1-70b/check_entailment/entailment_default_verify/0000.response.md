The original assessment claims that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the range of even numbers from 2 to `n * 2` (inclusive), with a step size of 2, and sums up the cubes of these numbers.

However, the output hints provided suggest that the function returns the sum of the cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) if `n` is a positive integer. This means that the function actually calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even numbers up to `2n`, not exactly the first `n` even natural numbers as stated in the problem description.

For example, if `n` is 3, the function will calculate the sum of the cubes of even numbers from 2 to 6 (inclusive), which are 2, 4, and 6. This aligns with the problem description. However, the function does not handle the case when `n` is less than or equal to 0, as stated in the output hints. In such cases, the function should return 0, but the provided code does not explicitly handle this case.

Upon closer inspection of the provided code, it can be observed that the function will return 0 when `n` is less than or equal to 0, because the range function will not generate any numbers in such cases. Therefore, the function implicitly handles this case.

Despite this, the original assessment seems accurate because the function does calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers for positive `n`. The output hints provide additional information about the function's behavior but do not contradict the original assessment.

The reason to keep the original assessment is that the function correctly implements the desired functionality as described in the problem description for the expected input (a positive integer). The output hints do not reveal any cases where the function fails to meet the problem description for valid inputs.

Final: **True**
