Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the range of even numbers from 2 to `n * 2` (inclusive), with a step size of 2. This ensures that only even numbers are considered. 

For each even number `i` in this range, the function calculates `i` cubed (`i ** 3`) and sums up these values.

The function correctly handles the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 3, the function will calculate the sum of the cubes of the first 3 even natural numbers: 2, 4, and 6. 

The function will return `2 ** 3 + 4 ** 3 + 6 ** 3`, which is the correct cube sum of the first 3 even natural numbers.

There are no apparent edge cases or potential errors in the function that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct for all potential cases.
