Based on the problem description, the program, and the output hints, I have evaluated the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a function to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The provided program defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of the cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive).

The output hints suggest that the function returns the correct sum for positive integer inputs `n`, but it does not mention what happens when `n` is less than or equal to 0. However, the provided code does not explicitly handle this case, but since we assume that the input will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

The original assessment is "None", implying that there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness.

Upon reviewing the code, I notice that it correctly generates the sequence of even numbers from 2 to `2n` and calculates the sum of their cubes. The use of a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` ensures efficient computation.

The output hints are consistent with the problem description and the provided code. They indicate that the function behaves as expected for positive integer inputs `n`.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
