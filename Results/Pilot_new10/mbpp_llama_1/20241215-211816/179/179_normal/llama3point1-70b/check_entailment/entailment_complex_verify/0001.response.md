The original assessment claims that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. This assessment is based on the fact that the function generates even numbers starting from 2 up to `n * 2` (inclusive) and calculates the cube of each even number.

However, the annotated version of the code states that the function returns the sum of the cubes of even numbers from 2 to 2n (inclusive) if `n` is a positive integer, and returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 0. This is a key point because the original assessment does not consider the case when `n` is less than or equal to 0.

But since we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we can disregard the case when `n` is less than or equal to 0.

The function does correctly calculate the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers as it generates the even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) and calculates the cube of each even number.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
