Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1(n)`, correctly calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]` generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers.
2. The generator expression `(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` calculates the cube of each even number in the list.
3. The built-in `sum` function adds up all the cubes calculated in the previous step.

To verify the correctness, let's consider a few examples:

* For `n = 2`, the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4. The sum of their cubes is `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`, which matches the provided assertion.
* For `n = 3`, the first three even natural numbers are 2, 4, and 6. The sum of their cubes is `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`, which matches the provided assertion.
* For `n = 4`, the first four even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, and 8. The sum of their cubes is `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`, which matches the provided assertion.

Since the provided assertions match the expected results, and the code seems to handle all potential cases correctly, the program is considered correct.
