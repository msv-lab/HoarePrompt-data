To determine the correctness of the program, we need to evaluate whether it accurately calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

The problem description asks for the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The first n even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6,..., 2n.

The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the cube sum of the numbers generated by the list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This list comprehension generates the numbers 2, 4, 6,..., 2n, which are indeed the first n even natural numbers.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function calculates the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to 2n, where n is a positive integer.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(2) == 72` and `assert func_1(3) == 288`, can be used to verify the correctness of the function. For example, the first n = 2 even natural numbers are 2 and 4. The cube sum of these numbers is 2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72, which matches the expected result.

Since the code accurately implements the calculation of the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers, and the unit tests confirm its correctness, the original assessment (which is None) does not provide any contradictory information.

Final: **True**
