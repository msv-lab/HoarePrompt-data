Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. It uses list comprehension to generate the even numbers from 2 to 2n, then calculates the sum of their cubes using a generator expression. 

The function handles positive integers as expected, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests. For example, `func_1(2)` correctly returns 72, which is the sum of the cubes of the first 2 even numbers: 2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72.

The program also implicitly handles non-integer values and negative integers by potentially truncating them to the nearest integer, which is an acceptable behavior given the problem description. However, it's worth noting that this behavior is not explicitly defined and might not be the desired behavior in all cases.

The provided output hints suggest that the function should return 0 for n equal to 0, which is not explicitly tested, but can be verified with `func_1(0)`. In this case, `even_numbers` will be an empty list, and `cube_sum` will be 0, as expected.

Overall, based on the provided code and output hints, the program appears to correctly calculate the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers for all potential cases.
