Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1(n)`, calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. **Even Numbers Generation**: The function generates the first `n` even natural numbers using the list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This is correct because the first `n` even natural numbers are indeed `2, 4, 6,..., 2n`.

2. **Cube Sum Calculation**: The function calculates the sum of cubes of these even numbers using a generator expression `(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` inside the built-in `sum` function. This is also correct because it accurately calculates the sum of cubes of the generated even numbers.

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(2) == 72` and `assert func_1(3) == 288` and `assert func_1(4) == 800` also validate the correctness of the function.

To further verify the correctness of the function, let's manually calculate the cube sum for `n = 2` and `n = 3`:

- For `n = 2`, the first two even natural numbers are `2` and `4`. The sum of their cubes is `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`, which matches the expected result.
- For `n = 3`, the first three even natural numbers are `2`, `4`, and `6`. The sum of their cubes is `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`, which also matches the expected result.
- For `n = 4`, the first four even natural numbers are `2`, `4`, `6`, and `8`. The sum of their cubes is `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`, which matches the expected result.

Since the function correctly calculates the cube sum for the provided unit tests and manually verified cases, I conclude that the code is correct.
