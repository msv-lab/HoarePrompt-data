The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to `2n`, handling positive integers as expected, returning 0 for `n` equal to 0, and potentially handling negative integers and non-integer values by returning 0 or truncating `n` to the nearest integer, respectively.
