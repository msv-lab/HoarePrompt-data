To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `sum` is 1

Given code:
```python
sum += math.comb(n, i)
```

The `math.comb(n, i)` function calculates the number of ways to choose `i` items from `n` items without repetition and without order. This is also known as the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as `n! / (i! * (n-i)!)`.

Given that `i` is 1, `math.comb(n, i)` simplifies to `n! / (1! * (n-1)!)`, which further simplifies to `n` because `n! / (n-1)! = n` and `1! = 1`.

So, the expression becomes:
```python
sum += n
```

Given the initial state, `sum` is 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `sum` will be `1 + n`.

The states of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `sum` is `1 + n`**
