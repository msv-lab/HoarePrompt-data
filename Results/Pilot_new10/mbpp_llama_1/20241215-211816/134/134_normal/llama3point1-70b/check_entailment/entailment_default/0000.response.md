Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function, `func_1(n)`, correctly calculates the sum of binomial coefficients for even indices up to `n`. The function utilizes the `math.comb(n, i)` function from Python's standard library to calculate "n choose i" for each `i` from 0 to `n`. It checks if `i` is even with the condition `if i % 2 == 0`, and if so, adds the corresponding binomial coefficient to the sum.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that it returns the sum of binomial coefficients "n choose i" for all even `i` from 0 to `n`. Given that the function iterates over all possible values of `i` from 0 to `n` and correctly identifies even indices, it should work as expected for all positive integer inputs of `n`.

There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to deviate from the problem description. The use of `math.comb(n, i)` ensures accurate calculation of binomial coefficients, and the loop correctly sums these coefficients for even indices. Therefore, based on the provided code and output hints, it appears that the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.
