You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
    return sum


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` accurately calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:
1. The function uses the `math.comb(n, i)` function to calculate the binomial coefficient, which is a built-in function in Python that calculates the number of ways to choose `i` items from `n` items without repetition and without order.
2. It iterates over all possible values of `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum.
4. Finally, it returns the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices.

This code correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases. The function works for any positive integer `n`, and it correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients. There are no obvious edge cases that the code does not handle, and it should work as expected for all valid inputs. 

For example, if we take `n = 3`, the function will calculate the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices as follows: 
- `math.comb(3, 0)` = 1 (even index 0)
- `math.comb(3, 2)` = 3 (even index 2)

The function will return `1 + 3 = 4`, which is the correct sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices for `n = 3`. 

Therefore, the code is correct, and it should work as expected for all valid inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer n and returns the sum of binomial coefficients "n choose i" for all even i from 0 to n

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
