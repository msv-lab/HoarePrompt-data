Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n. 

Here's why the program works as expected:
1. The program iterates over all possible indices (from 0 to n) using a for loop.
2. For each index i, it checks if the index is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`.
3. If the index is even, it calculates the binomial coefficient using `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the sum.
4. The `math.comb(n, i)` function calculates the number of ways to choose i items from n items without repetition and without order, which is the definition of a binomial coefficient.

Since the program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for all possible inputs, I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected. The code handles all edge cases, including n = 0, n = 1, and larger values of n. Therefore, the program is correct.
