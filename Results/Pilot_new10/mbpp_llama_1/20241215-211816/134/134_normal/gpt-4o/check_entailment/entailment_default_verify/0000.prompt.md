You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is a simple function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

This function works based on the mathematical property that the sum of the binomial coefficients of even indices for the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` is equal to `2^(n-1)`. This property is utilized in the function to directly calculate the sum without actually calculating the individual binomial coefficients.

The unit tests provided, such as `func_1(4) == 8`, `func_1(6) == 32`, and `func_1(2) == 2`, all pass, confirming that the function works correctly for these cases.

Moreover, this property applies to all positive integers `n`, and there is no apparent edge case that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, we can confidently conclude that the function is correct for all potential inputs. 

It's worth noting that the function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer. However, as the problem description specifies that `n` is a positive integer, it can be assumed that the function will only be used with valid inputs. If the function were to be used with other types of inputs, additional error checking would be necessary. But based on the given problem description, the function appears to be correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer n and returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1) without validating whether n is a positive integer, which may lead to unexpected results for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
