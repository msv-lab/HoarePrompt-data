You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is a simple function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

This function works based on the mathematical property that the sum of the binomial coefficients of even indices for the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` is equal to `2^(n-1)`. This property is utilized in the function to directly calculate the sum without actually calculating the individual binomial coefficients.

The unit tests provided, such as `func_1(4) == 8`, `func_1(6) == 32`, and `func_1(2) == 2`, all pass, confirming that the function works correctly for these cases.

Moreover, this property applies to all positive integers `n`, and there is no apparent edge case that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, we can confidently conclude that the function is correct for all potential inputs. 

It's worth noting that the function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer. However, as the problem description specifies that `n` is a positive integer, it can be assumed that the function will only be used with valid inputs. If the function were to be used with other types of inputs, additional error checking would be necessary. But based on the given problem description, the function appears to be correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1), where n is a positive integer


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
