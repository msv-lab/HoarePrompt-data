You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. This function uses the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients of a given power is equal to `2^(n-1)`.

To verify the correctness of this program, we need to understand the mathematical concept it is based on and test it with various inputs.

The formula for the sum of even index binomial coefficients is based on the Binomial Theorem, which states that `(x + y)^n = âˆ‘[k=0 to n] (n choose k) * x^(n-k) * y^k`. When `x = 1` and `y = 1`, the sum of all binomial coefficients is `2^n`. The sum of even index binomial coefficients can be found by taking the average of `(1 + 1)^n` and `(1 - 1)^n`, which simplifies to `(2^n + 0)/2 = 2^(n-1)`.

After analyzing the given code, it appears to correctly calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients using this mathematical property.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function:

- `func_1(4)` returns `8`, which is `2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8`.
- `func_1(6)` returns `32`, which is `2^(6-1) = 2^5 = 32`.
- `func_1(2)` returns `2`, which is `2^(2-1) = 2^1 = 2`.

Since the code matches the mathematical property for the given test cases and does not contain any apparent logical errors or edge cases that it does not handle, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer n and returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1) without validating whether n is a positive integer, which may lead to unexpected results for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
