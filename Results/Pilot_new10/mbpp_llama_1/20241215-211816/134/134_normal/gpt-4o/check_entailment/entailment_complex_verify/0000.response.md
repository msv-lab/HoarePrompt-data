The original assessment concludes that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` is correct based on the mathematical property that the sum of the binomial coefficients of even indices for the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` is equal to `2^(n-1)`. This property is indeed utilized in the function to directly calculate the sum without actually calculating the individual binomial coefficients.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by noting that the function returns `2` raised to the power of `(n - 1)`, where `n` is a positive integer. Since we assume that the input to the program will be valid and will not cause any errors, the lack of validation for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs does not affect the correctness of the function for valid inputs.

The unit tests provided, such as `func_1(4) == 8`, `func_1(6) == 32`, and `func_1(2) == 2`, all pass, confirming that the function works correctly for these cases. Moreover, the mathematical property utilized in the function applies to all positive integers `n`, which further supports the correctness of the function.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the original assessment is accurate, and the function is correct according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
