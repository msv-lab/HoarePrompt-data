The function func_1 accepts an integer n and returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1). 

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the function does not include any error checking to handle cases where n is not a positive integer. Therefore, the function may not behave as expected for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs.

For instance, if n is 0 or a negative integer, the function will still return a value, but it may not be meaningful in the context of the problem. Similarly, if n is a non-integer, the function will return a value, but it may not be accurate.

Considering these potential edge cases, the functionality of the function is to calculate and return 2 raised to the power of (n - 1) for any input n, without validating whether n is a positive integer or not.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer n and returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1) without validating whether n is a positive integer, which may lead to unexpected results for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs. **
