To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze both the description and the code.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the smallest number in a list. The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers `lst` as input and returns the smallest integer in the list.

The function uses Python's built-in `min()` function to find the smallest element in the list. This approach directly aligns with the problem description's requirement to find the smallest number in a list.

However, there's an additional note in the annotated program that mentions the function should raise a `ValueError` if the list is empty. Let's examine how the provided function behaves with an empty list:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
```

If we call `func_1([])`, it will raise a `ValueError` because the `min()` function with an empty sequence raises a `ValueError`. This behavior matches the annotation's note about raising a `ValueError` for an empty list, although the function itself does not explicitly include a check for an empty list before calling `min()`. This is because the `min()` function inherently handles the empty list case by raising an exception.

Given these points, the program does meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for non-empty lists and inherently handles the empty list case as described in the annotations.

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it finds the smallest number in a non-empty list and, by virtue of using the `min()` function, it also correctly raises a `ValueError` when given an empty list, aligning with the problem description's implicit requirement (as detailed in the annotations) to handle empty lists in such a manner.
