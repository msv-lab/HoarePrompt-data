Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the output hints, the function should raise a ValueError if the list is empty. However, the code does not include this check and will simply return an error when trying to find the minimum of an empty list. 

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to include a check for an empty list, like so:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        raise ValueError("List is empty")
    return min(lst)
```

This way, the function will correctly handle all potential cases, including the empty list scenario. Without this check, the function does not fully follow the problem description and output hints, resulting in a correctness classification of False.
