Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, we can assess the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the smallest number in a list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in the list.

The original assessment is None, which means there is no initial evaluation of the program's correctness.

The output hints provide additional information about the expected behavior of the function. Specifically, they state that the function should return the smallest integer in the list if it is non-empty, or raise a ValueError if the list is empty.

However, the provided code does not match this expected behavior. The `min` function will raise a ValueError if the list is empty, but this is not explicitly handled in the code. Moreover, the code does not include any error handling or checks for empty lists.

Despite this, the `min` function in Python will indeed raise a ValueError if the input list is empty. Therefore, the code is actually correct based on the output hints.

Final: **True**
