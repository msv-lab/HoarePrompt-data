You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function is designed to return the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list) or the smallest of two or more arguments.

The function meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly returns the smallest number from the list for all potential cases. 

Here are a few reasons why this code is correct:

1.  **Handling empty lists**: However, the code does not have error checking for empty lists. If an empty list is passed to the function, it will raise a `ValueError` exception because the `min` function cannot find the smallest item in an empty sequence. This is a potential edge case that the code does not handle.

2.  **Non-numeric values**: Another edge case is if the list contains non-numeric values. The `min` function can handle non-numeric values, but it may not behave as expected. For example, if the list contains a mix of numbers and strings, the `min` function will return the smallest string, not the smallest number.

3.  **Handling duplicate smallest numbers**: If there are multiple instances of the smallest number in the list, the function will still return the correct smallest number. This is because the `min` function returns the first smallest item it finds.

4.  **Handling negative numbers and zero**: The function correctly handles negative numbers and zero as the smallest number in the list.

In general, this code is correct for lists containing only numbers, but it may not behave as expected for lists containing non-numeric values or empty lists.

It would be more robust to add error checking code to handle these edge cases, such as checking if the list is empty before trying to find the smallest number, or checking if all elements in the list are numbers before trying to find the smallest number.

Here is a version of the function with error checking:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        raise ValueError("List is empty")
    if not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in lst):
        raise ValueError("List contains non-numeric values")
    return min(lst)
```
With these checks in place, the function is more robust and will behave correctly for a wider range of inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a non-empty list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the smallest integer in the list `lst`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the smallest integer in the list if it is non-empty, or raises a ValueError if the list is empty

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
