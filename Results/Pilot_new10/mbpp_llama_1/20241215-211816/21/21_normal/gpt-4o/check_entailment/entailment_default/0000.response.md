Correctness: **True**

The given code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the smallest integer in the list using the built-in `min` function. The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns the smallest integer in the list if it is non-empty.

The provided unit tests confirm that the function behaves as expected for non-empty lists:
- `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` returns `1`, which is the smallest number in the list.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `1`, which is the smallest number in the list.
- `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` returns `45`, which is the smallest number in the list.

However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where the input list is empty, which the output hints mention should raise a `ValueError`. In Python, calling `min` on an empty list does indeed raise a `ValueError`:
```python
>>> min([])
ValueError: min() arg is an empty sequence
```
Since the `min` function itself raises a `ValueError` when given an empty list, the code implicitly handles this case without needing explicit error handling. Therefore, the code works as expected for all potential cases, including non-empty and empty lists.

Given that the code matches the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, including raising an exception for empty lists due to the behavior of the `min` function, it is considered correct.
