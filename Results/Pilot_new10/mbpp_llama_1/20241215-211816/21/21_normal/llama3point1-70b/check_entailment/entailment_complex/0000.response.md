Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes a non-empty list of numbers `nums` as input and returns the smallest number in the list using the built-in `min` function.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Handling non-empty list of numbers**: The function uses the `min` function to find the smallest number in the list, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.
2. **Throwing ValueError for empty list**: Although not explicitly handled, the `min` function in Python throws a `ValueError` when called with an empty sequence, which aligns with the annotation.
3. **Throwing TypeError for non-numeric values**: The `min` function also throws a `TypeError` when the list contains non-numeric values, as it cannot compare them to determine the minimum.

However, it's worth noting that the function does not explicitly check for these edge cases, but the built-in `min` function handles them as expected.

The function behaves correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Non-empty list of numbers: Returns the smallest number in the list.
* Empty list: Throws a `ValueError`.
* List with non-numeric values: Throws a `TypeError`.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is **True**.
