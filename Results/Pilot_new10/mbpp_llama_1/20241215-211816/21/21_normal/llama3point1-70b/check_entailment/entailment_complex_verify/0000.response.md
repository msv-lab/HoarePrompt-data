To assess the correctness of the program, we need to evaluate it against the problem description and the provided annotations.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the smallest number in a list. The original program provided is:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)
```
Given this program, the original assessment is "None," which implies a lack of evaluation or judgment on the program's correctness.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the program's behavior:
```python
# State of the program right before the function call: nums is a non-empty list of numbers.
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)
    # The program returns the smallest number in the list 'nums'
# Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers `nums` and returns the smallest number in the list. However, if the list is empty, it throws a ValueError, and if the list contains non-numeric values, it throws a TypeError.
```
Based on the problem description, the program is designed to find the smallest number in a list, which it does by using the built-in `min()` function in Python. This function indeed returns the smallest item in an iterable (like a list) or the smallest of two or more arguments.

The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected for its intended use case (a non-empty list of numbers), returning the smallest number in the list. Additionally, the annotations highlight two edge cases:
1. If the list is empty, `min()` throws a `ValueError`.
2. If the list contains non-numeric values, `min()` may throw a `TypeError`, depending on the specific values (for example, comparing strings will not throw an error but will return the "smallest" based on lexicographical order).

Given these details:
- The program meets the requirements under the assumption of valid input (a non-empty list of numbers).
- The annotations correctly describe the behavior of the program, including its handling of edge cases.

However, the original assessment's lack of comment does not provide any insight into the program's correctness. The annotated version provides clarity that the program is correct under the assumption of valid input, as per the guidelines of the task.

Therefore, considering the program description, the code itself, and the annotations, the final assessment is:
Final: **True**
