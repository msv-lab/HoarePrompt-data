The original assessment is based on the understanding that the `min()` function in Python will correctly return the smallest number in a list for all potential cases, including lists with positive and negative numbers, lists with duplicate smallest numbers, and lists with a single element. However, the original assessment also mentions the edge case where the input list is empty, which would cause the `min()` function to raise a `ValueError`.

The output hints provided support the original assessment in that the function is designed to return the smallest number in a list and will behave as expected for non-empty lists containing numeric values. The hints also correctly point out the behavior for edge cases such as an empty list (`ValueError`) and a list containing non-numeric values (`TypeError`).

Given the problem description asks for a function to find the smallest number in a list, and considering we assume the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of numbers), the original assessment aligns well with the expected behavior of the provided Python function `func_1(nums)`. The function does indeed find the smallest number in a list correctly for the assumed valid inputs.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the assumption of valid input (non-empty list of numbers), the original assessment is accurate. The program behaves as expected under the given constraints and correctly identifies the smallest number in the list.

Final: **True**
