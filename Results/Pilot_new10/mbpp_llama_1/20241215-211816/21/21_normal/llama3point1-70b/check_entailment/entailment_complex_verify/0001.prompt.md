You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly finds the smallest number in a list. The built-in `min()` function in Python returns the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list) or the smallest of two or more arguments. 

The function works as expected for lists containing positive and negative integers, as well as lists containing duplicate values. It will also work correctly for lists containing a single element, as the smallest number in a list with one element is that element itself.

For example, if you call `func_1([5, 2, 9, 1, 7])`, the function will return `1`, which is the smallest number in the list. 

This function assumes that the input list is non-empty. If the input list is empty, the `min()` function will raise a `ValueError` because it cannot find the smallest item in an empty list. However, since the problem description does not specify how the function should handle empty lists, and the function does correctly find the smallest number in non-empty lists, we can conclude that the function is correct for the specified task. 

No edge cases were found where the code did not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a non-empty list of numbers.
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)
    #The program returns the smallest number in the list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers `nums` and returns the smallest number in the list. However, if the list is empty, it throws a ValueError, and if the list contains non-numeric values, it throws a TypeError.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
