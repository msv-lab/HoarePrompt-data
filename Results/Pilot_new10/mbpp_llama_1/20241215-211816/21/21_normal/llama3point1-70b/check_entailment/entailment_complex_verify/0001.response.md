The original assessment is "None", which implies that no initial assessment was made. 

The problem description requires a function to find the smallest number in a list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest number in the list using the built-in `min` function.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function accepts a non-empty list of numbers and returns the smallest number in the list. It also mentions that if the list is empty, it throws a `ValueError`, and if the list contains non-numeric values, it throws a `TypeError`. However, these edge cases are not explicitly handled in the provided code, but the `min` function in Python does indeed raise these exceptions when given an empty list or a list containing non-numeric values.

Given the assumption that the input to the program will be valid and will not cause any errors, the program is correct. It meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the annotated version of the code.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
