Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, it appears that the original assessment is accurate. 

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the smallest number in a list. The original assessment correctly states that the given function `func_1` uses the built-in `min()` function in Python to find the smallest item in the list, which achieves the desired functionality.

The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment, as it states that the function accepts a non-empty list of numbers `nums` and returns the smallest number in the list. Although it mentions potential errors if the list is empty or contains non-numeric values, the problem description and the original assessment assume that the input list is non-empty and contains only numeric values.

Given that we are assuming the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the potential errors mentioned in the annotated version do not affect the correctness of the function for the specified task.

Therefore, based on the information available, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
