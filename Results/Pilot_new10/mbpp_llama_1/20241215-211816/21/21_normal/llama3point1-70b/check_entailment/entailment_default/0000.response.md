Correctness: **False**.

The code does not handle the case when the input list is empty. According to the Python documentation, the built-in `min()` function raises a ValueError when given an empty sequence. This behavior is mentioned in the output hints. However, the problem description simply asks to find the smallest number in a list without specifying what should happen for an empty list. The code does not provide any checks or error handling for this case, which could be considered as not meeting the problem description for every potential case.

Another case where the code may not work as expected is when the list contains non-numeric values. The `min()` function will raise a TypeError when comparing different data types, which is also mentioned in the output hints. However, the problem description does not explicitly state what should happen for non-numeric input.

To make the code correct, it could include error checking to handle these cases, for example, by checking if the list is empty or contains non-numeric values and returning a suitable error message or handling the error accordingly. 

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to handle these cases:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    if not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in nums):
        raise TypeError("Input list contains non-numeric values")
    return min(nums)
```
