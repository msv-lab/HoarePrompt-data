The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, both of which are integers. After executing the function body, it returns a boolean value based on the binary representation of the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`. The return value is `True` if the binary representation of the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` has exactly one '1' bit, and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, num1 and num2, and returns True if the binary representation of their bitwise XOR has exactly one '1' bit, False otherwise.**
