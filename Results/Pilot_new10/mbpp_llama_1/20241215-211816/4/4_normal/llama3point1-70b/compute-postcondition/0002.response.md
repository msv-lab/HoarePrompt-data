The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `num1` and `num2`. It calculates the bitwise XOR of these two integers and then checks if the binary representation of the result has exactly one '1' bit. 

Upon examining the code, it is apparent that the code does what the annotations describe: it checks for the presence of exactly one '1' bit in the binary representation of the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` and returns True if this condition is met, False otherwise. 

However, it's essential to consider potential edge cases and the code's behavior under various input conditions. For example, if both `num1` and `num2` are the same, their bitwise XOR will be 0, which has no '1' bits, so the function will return False. If the two numbers are different but their bitwise XOR results in a binary number with more than one '1' bit, the function will also return False.

There are no apparent missing functionality or discrepancies between the annotations and the code's actual behavior based on the given information. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `num1` and `num2`, calculates their bitwise XOR, and returns True if the binary representation of the result has exactly one '1' bit, False otherwise, covering all cases including when `num1` equals `num2`, and when the XOR operation results in binary numbers with zero or more than one '1' bits. **
