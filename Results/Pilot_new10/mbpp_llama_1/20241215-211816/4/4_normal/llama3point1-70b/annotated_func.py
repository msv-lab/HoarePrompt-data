#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns True if the binary representation of the bitwise XOR of num1 and num2 has exactly one '1' bit, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `num1` and `num2`, calculates their bitwise XOR, and returns True if the binary representation of the result has exactly one '1' bit, False otherwise, covering all cases including when `num1` equals `num2`, and when the XOR operation results in binary numbers with zero or more than one '1' bits.
