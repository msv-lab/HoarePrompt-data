Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. The function uses the XOR operation (`^`) to compare the two numbers. The XOR operation returns a binary number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits in the two input numbers are different.

The function then converts the result of the XOR operation to a binary string using `bin()` and counts the number of '1' bits in the string using `count('1')`. If the count is 1, it means that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

This approach correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the two numbers are equal, the XOR operation returns 0, and `bin()` returns '0b0', so `count('1')` returns 0, indicating that the numbers do not differ at one bit position.
* When the two numbers differ at one bit position, the XOR operation returns a number with exactly one '1' bit, so `count('1')` returns 1.
* When the two numbers differ at more than one bit position, the XOR operation returns a number with more than one '1' bit, so `count('1')` returns a value greater than 1.

The function correctly handles all edge cases, including negative numbers and zero. The XOR operation and binary conversion work correctly even when the input numbers have different signs or are zero.

Since I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
