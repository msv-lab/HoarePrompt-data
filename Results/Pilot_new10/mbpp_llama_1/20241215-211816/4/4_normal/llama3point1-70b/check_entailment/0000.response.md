Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(num1, num2)` checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. The function uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to compare the bits of `num1` and `num2`. The XOR operation returns 1 for each position where the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` are different.

The `bin()` function is used to convert the result of the XOR operation to a binary string. The `count('1')` method is then used to count the number of 1s in the binary string, which represents the number of bit positions where `num1` and `num2` differ.

If the count of 1s is equal to 1, it means that `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function works correctly for all possible inputs because the XOR operation and the count of 1s in the binary string accurately reflect the number of bit positions where the two numbers differ.

For example, if `num1 = 5` (binary 101) and `num2 = 3` (binary 011), the XOR operation will result in `6` (binary 110), which has two 1s. Therefore, the function will correctly return `False` because `num1` and `num2` differ at two bit positions, not one.

On the other hand, if `num1 = 5` (binary 101) and `num2 = 4` (binary 100), the XOR operation will result in `1` (binary 001), which has one 1. Therefore, the function will correctly return `True` because `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position.
