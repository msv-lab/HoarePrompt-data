Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(num1, num2)` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only. Here's why:

1. The XOR operation (`num1 ^ num2`) is used to compare the bits of `num1` and `num2`. In binary XOR operation, a result bit is 1 only if the corresponding bits in the operands are different. Therefore, the result of `num1 ^ num2` will have bits set (1) only where `num1` and `num2` differ.

2. The `bin()` function is used to convert the result of `num1 ^ num2` into a binary string. This allows us to easily count the number of bits where `num1` and `num2` differ.

3. The `count('1') == 1` condition checks if there is exactly one bit position where `num1` and `num2` differ. If this condition is true, it means `num1` and `num2` differ at one bit position only, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function handles all possible cases:

- When `num1` equals `num2`, the XOR operation results in 0, and `bin(0).count('1')` returns 0, so the function correctly returns `False`.

- When the XOR operation results in binary numbers with zero '1' bits (i.e., `num1 == num2`), the function correctly returns `False`.

- When the XOR operation results in binary numbers with more than one '1' bits (i.e., `num1` and `num2` differ at more than one bit position), the function correctly returns `False`.

- When the XOR operation results in binary numbers with exactly one '1' bit (i.e., `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position), the function correctly returns `True`.

Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
