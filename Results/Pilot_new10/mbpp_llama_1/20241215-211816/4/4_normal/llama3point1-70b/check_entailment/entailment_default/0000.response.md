Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(num1, num2)` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only. The expression `bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1` calculates the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`, converts the result to a binary string, and counts the number of '1' bits. If the count is 1, it means that only one bit position differs between `num1` and `num2`.

This approach works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* When `num1` equals `num2`: In this case, the XOR operation results in 0, which has no '1' bits, so the function correctly returns `False`.
* When the XOR operation results in a binary number with zero or more than one '1' bits: The function correctly returns `False` in these cases.
* When the XOR operation results in a binary number with exactly one '1' bit: The function correctly returns `True` in this case.

The output hints agree with the code, and they provide a clear description of the function's behavior. The code is concise and efficient, and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
