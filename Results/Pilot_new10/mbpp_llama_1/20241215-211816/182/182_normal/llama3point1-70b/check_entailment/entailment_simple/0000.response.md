Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. 

This is achieved through a list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]`, where `s[-1]` refers to the last character of each string `s` in the tuple `strings`. This is a standard Python way to access the last element of a sequence (in this case, a string).

The program will work correctly for all potential cases, including:

- An empty tuple, in which case it will return an empty list `[]`.
- A tuple containing strings of varying lengths, in which case it will return a list of the last characters of each string.
- A tuple containing empty strings, in which case it will raise an `IndexError`, because there is no last character to access. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, so it can be considered as an edge case that is not covered.
- A tuple containing non-string elements, in which case it will raise a `TypeError`, because the `[-1]` indexing operation is not defined for non-sequence types. Again, this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

However, assuming the input is a tuple of strings (as stated in the problem description), the program will always return a list of the last characters of each string, which meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
