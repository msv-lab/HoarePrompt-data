The original assessment seems to be mostly accurate, as the provided function `func_1` indeed takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string. The list comprehension used in the function is a concise and readable way to achieve this.

However, upon closer inspection, it's noticed that the original assessment mentions the function will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception when encountering empty strings. While this is a valid edge case, the problem description and the annotated version of the code do not explicitly mention how the function should handle empty strings. Given the assumption that the input will always be valid, it can be inferred that the input tuple will not contain any empty strings.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function is designed to return a list of last characters of all the strings in the tuple 'strings', which aligns with the problem description.

Considering all the information available, the original assessment appears to be accurate, assuming the input will always be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Final: **True**
