You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string. This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings` and extracts the last character using `s[-1]`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Empty strings: If the input tuple contains empty strings, `s[-1]` will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception. However, this is a valid edge case, and the function behavior is predictable.
* Single-character strings: The function correctly extracts the only character in the string.
* Multi-character strings: The function correctly extracts the last character of each string.
* Tuples with different lengths of strings: The function correctly handles tuples containing strings of varying lengths.
* Tuples with duplicate strings: The function correctly handles tuples containing duplicate strings.

Since I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct. The code is concise, readable, and handles all potential edge cases, making it a well-designed solution to the problem.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple of sequences, returns a list of the last elements of each sequence in the tuple, handling empty sequences by adding an empty string (or the last element if the sequence is not a string) to the list, and returns an empty list if the input tuple is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
