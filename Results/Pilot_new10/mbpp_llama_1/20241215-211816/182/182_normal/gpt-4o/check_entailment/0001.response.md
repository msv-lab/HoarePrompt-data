Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it successfully extracts the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and returns a list of the last characters of each string, which is achieved by `s[-1]`.

This approach works for all potential cases, including tuples with strings of varying lengths and contents. The unit tests provided in the problem description also support this conclusion, as the function returns the expected results for different inputs.

In general, this program will work correctly for any tuple of strings, regardless of the strings' lengths or contents, because Python's indexing syntax (`s[-1]`) is designed to handle this case. It will always return the last character of a string, or an empty string if the input string is empty. However, since there are no unit tests provided for empty strings, it's worth noting that the function will return an empty string for an empty string input, which may or may not be the desired behavior depending on the context. But based on the given problem description and unit tests, the program is correct.
