Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code seems to correctly extract the rear index element of each string in the given tuple for the provided test cases. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the code does not raise an IndexError when it encounters an empty string in the tuple. The problem description states that the function should raise an IndexError if any string in the tuple is empty. 

For example, if we pass an empty string to the function like this: `func_1(('Mers', '', 'Vers'))`, the function will return `['s', '', 's']` instead of raising an IndexError. This indicates that the function does not handle empty strings as specified in the problem description. 

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
