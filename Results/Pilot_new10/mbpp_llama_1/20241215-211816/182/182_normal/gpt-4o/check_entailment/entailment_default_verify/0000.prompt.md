You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']
assert func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People')) == ['e', 'r', 'e']
assert func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go')) == ['a', 't', 'o']

def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters, where each character is the last element of the corresponding string in the input tuple. The function uses a list comprehension to achieve this.

Here's why I believe the code is correct:

* The function iterates over each string `s` in the input tuple `tup`.
* For each string `s`, it extracts the last character using `s[-1]`, which is a valid and efficient way to access the last element of a string in Python.
* The extracted characters are collected in a list using the list comprehension syntax, which is a concise and expressive way to create lists in Python.
* The function does not perform any error checking or handling, which might be a concern if the input tuple can contain non-string elements or empty strings. However, based on the provided problem description and examples, it appears that the input is expected to be a tuple of non-empty strings. If this assumption holds, the function should work correctly.

I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I consider the program to be correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple of strings, returns a list of the last characters of each non-empty string in the tuple, and raises an IndexError if any string in the tuple is empty. If the tuple is empty, it returns an empty list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
