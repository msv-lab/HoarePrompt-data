The function func_1 accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple.

Looking at the code, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and extract the last character using `s[-1]`. 

If the tuple is empty, the function will return an empty list, as there are no strings to extract last characters from.

If any string in the tuple is empty, `s[-1]` will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception, because there is no last character to extract. However, the code does not handle this case explicitly.

Given the actual code, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple of strings, returns a list of the last characters of each non-empty string in the tuple, and raises an IndexError if any string in the tuple is empty. If the tuple is empty, it returns an empty list. **
