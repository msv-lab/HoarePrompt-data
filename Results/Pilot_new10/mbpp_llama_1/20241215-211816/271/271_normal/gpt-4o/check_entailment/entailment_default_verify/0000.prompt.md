You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
assert func_1(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))) == [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
assert func_1(((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))) == [25.5, -18.0, 3.75]
assert func_1(((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40))) == [305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]

def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        averages.append(avg)
    return averages


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program accurately implements the described functionality. It calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. Here's why it works correctly:

1. It first determines the number of elements in each tuple (`num_elements = len(tuples[0])`). This assumes that all tuples have the same length, which is a reasonable assumption based on the problem description and the provided unit tests.

2. It then iterates over each position `i` in the tuples. For each position, it extracts all elements at that position from each tuple using a list comprehension (`elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`).

3. It calculates the average of these elements by summing them up and dividing by the total number of tuples (`avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`).

4. The calculated average is then appended to the `averages` list.

5. After iterating over all positions, the function returns the `averages` list.

The code handles the problem description correctly for all potential cases, assuming that the input is a tuple of tuples where all inner tuples have the same length. The unit tests provided also demonstrate that the function works as expected for different inputs.

However, it's worth noting that the code does not include any error checking to handle edge cases, such as:

- An empty input tuple.
- Tuples of different lengths within the input tuple.
- Non-numeric values within the tuples.

If the program is expected to handle these edge cases, additional error checking and handling code would be necessary. But based on the problem description and the provided unit tests, the code appears to be correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple of tuples with the same length and containing numbers, and returns a list of averages where each average is the mean of elements at the same position across all inner tuples. However, it does not handle cases where the input tuple is empty, or where inner tuples are of different lengths, or where inner tuples contain non-numeric values, potentially raising IndexError or TypeError in such scenarios.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
