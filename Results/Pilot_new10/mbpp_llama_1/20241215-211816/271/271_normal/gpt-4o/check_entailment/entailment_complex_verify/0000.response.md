To assess the correctness of the program, we need to analyze the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version of the code. The problem description asks for a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

The original assessment was "None," meaning no initial judgment on the correctness of the code was provided.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that does the following:
1. Determines the number of elements in the tuples by checking the length of the first tuple (`num_elements = len(tuples[0])`).
2. Initializes an empty list `averages` to store the average values.
3. Iterates over each position in the tuples, calculates the average of the elements at that position across all tuples, and appends this average to the `averages` list.

The annotated version of the code clarifies the state of the program at different points:
- Before the function call, `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
- After the for loop has been executed, `averages` contains the averages of elements at each position across all inner tuples.
- The function returns a list of averages where each average corresponds to the mean of elements at the same position across all inner tuples in `tuples`.

The key observations from the annotated code are:
- The function assumes all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers. This assumption aligns with the problem description.
- The function correctly calculates the average of elements at each position across all tuples and returns these averages as a list.

However, the annotated code also notes that the function does not handle cases where the input tuple is empty, or where inner tuples are of different lengths, or where inner tuples contain non-numeric values, potentially raising `IndexError` or `TypeError` in such scenarios.

Given the assumptions of the problem (that the input will be valid and not cause errors), and despite the lack of error handling for edge cases, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requested functionality. It calculates and returns the averages of the corresponding elements from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples.

**Reason for Final Assessment:**
The original assessment was "None," but based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement under the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a tuple of tuples with the same length and containing numbers). The lack of error handling for invalid inputs does not affect the correctness under the given assumptions.

**Final: True**
