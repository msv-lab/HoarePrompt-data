You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
assert func_1(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))) == [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
assert func_1(((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))) == [25.5, -18.0, 3.75]
assert func_1(((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40))) == [305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]

def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        averages.append(avg)
    return averages


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It takes a tuple of tuples as input and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

The program works as follows:

- It first determines the number of elements in each tuple by checking the length of the first tuple.
- It then iterates over each position in the tuples.
- For each position, it extracts the elements at that position from all tuples using a list comprehension.
- It calculates the average of these elements by summing them up and dividing by the total number of tuples.
- Finally, it appends the calculated average to the `averages` list, which is returned as the result.

The program correctly handles the case where the tuples have the same length, which is a requirement according to the problem description. The unit tests provided also demonstrate that the program works correctly for different inputs.

There are no obvious edge cases that the program does not handle, such as handling tuples with different lengths (which is not a valid input according to the problem description), or handling tuples with non-numeric values (which would cause a TypeError when trying to calculate the sum).

Overall, based on the provided code and problem description, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))) == [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
assert func_1(((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))) == [25.5, -18.0, 3.75]
assert func_1(((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40))) == [305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        
        averages.append(avg)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is a list containing the averages of elements at each position across all inner tuples, `i` is `num_elements - 1` if `num_elements` is greater than 0, otherwise, the loop does not execute and `averages` remains an empty list.
    return averages
    #The program returns a list of averages where each average corresponds to the mean of elements at the same position across all inner tuples in `tuples`, with the list having a length equal to `num_elements`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
