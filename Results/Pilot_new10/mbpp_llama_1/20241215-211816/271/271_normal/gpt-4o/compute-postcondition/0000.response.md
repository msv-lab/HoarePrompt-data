The code `num_elements = len(tuples[0])` assigns the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples` to the variable `num_elements`. Since each inner tuple has the same length, `num_elements` will be equal to the length of any inner tuple. 

The state of `tuples` is not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is equal to the length of any inner tuple.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is equal to the length of any inner tuple.**
