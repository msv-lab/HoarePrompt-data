According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num_elements`. If `i` is less than `num_elements`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `num_elements` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `num_elements` must be greater than 1.

Additionally, the state of `elements_at_position` and `avg` will also change in the next iteration. In the next iteration, `elements_at_position` will contain the elements at position `i` (which is 1) of all inner tuples in `tuples`, and `avg` will be the average of these elements.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 1 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is a list containing the average of the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
