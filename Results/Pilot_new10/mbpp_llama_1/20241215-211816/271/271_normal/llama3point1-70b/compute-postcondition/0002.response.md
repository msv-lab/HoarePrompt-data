To analyze the functionality of the given function `func_1`, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Function Parameters and Return Type**: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is described as a tuple of tuples where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers. The function returns a list of averages.

2. **Functionality Based on Code**: The function uses a list comprehension with `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the inner tuples, effectively grouping numbers from the same position across all inner tuples together. It then calculates the sum of each group and divides by the total number of inner tuples (`len(tuples)`) to find the average for each position.

3. **Analysis of Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - **Division by Zero Error**: If `tuples` is an empty tuple, `len(tuples)` would be 0, leading to a division by zero error. This edge case is not explicitly handled in the function or mentioned in the annotations.
   - **Non-Numeric Values**: The function assumes all elements within the inner tuples are numbers. If non-numeric values are present, a TypeError will occur when trying to sum these values.
   - **Inner Tuples of Different Lengths**: Although the annotations specify that all inner tuples have the same length, the function does not check for this. If inner tuples have different lengths, `zip(*tuples)` will stop at the end of the shortest tuple, potentially leading to unexpected results.

4. **Conclusion on Functionality**: The function calculates and returns a list of averages, where each average is the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples. However, it does not handle potential edge cases such as an empty input tuple (which would cause a division by zero error), non-numeric values within the tuples (leading to a TypeError), or inner tuples of different lengths (which could result in truncated calculations).

Given the above analysis, the functionality of `func_1` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple of tuples with numbers of the same length, and returns a list of averages where each average corresponds to the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples, but it may raise exceptions for invalid inputs such as empty tuples, non-numeric values, or tuples of different lengths. **
