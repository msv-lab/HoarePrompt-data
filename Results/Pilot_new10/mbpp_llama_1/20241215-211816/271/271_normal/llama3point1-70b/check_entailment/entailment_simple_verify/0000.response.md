The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. 

Here's why it works:

- The `zip(*tuples)` expression unpacks the input tuple of tuples and groups corresponding elements together from each tuple. 
- The list comprehension then calculates the average of each group by summing the values and dividing by the number of tuples. 

The annotations provided in the code also confirm this. Before the function call, `tuples` is indeed a tuple of tuples where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers. The return statement calculates and returns the list of averages as expected.

The only possible issue mentioned in the original assessment is the potential `ZeroDivisionError` if the input tuple of tuples is empty. However, as stated in the problem description and the annotations, we assume the input will always be valid, so this is not a concern in this case.

Therefore, the final assessment is that the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

Final: **True**
