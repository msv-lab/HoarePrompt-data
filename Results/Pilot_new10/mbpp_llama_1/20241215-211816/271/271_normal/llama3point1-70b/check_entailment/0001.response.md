Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. It takes a tuple of tuples as input, transposes the tuples using the `zip(*tuples)` function, and then calculates the average of each position by summing the values at each position and dividing by the total number of tuples.

The `zip(*tuples)` function is a key part of the solution, as it unpacks the tuple of tuples into separate arguments to the `zip` function, effectively transposing the tuples. This allows the program to iterate over the corresponding values from each tuple, which is necessary for calculating the averages.

For example, if the input is `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, the `zip(*tuples)` function will return an iterator over the tuples `(1, 4, 7)`, `(2, 5, 8)`, and `(3, 6, 9)`. The list comprehension then calculates the average of each of these tuples, resulting in the output `[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]`.

The program correctly handles tuples of any length and with any number of inner tuples, making it a robust solution to the problem. After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I was unable to find any examples where the program does not work as expected, leading me to conclude that the program is correct.
