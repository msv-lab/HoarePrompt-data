You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. 

Here's why it works:

- The `zip(*tuples)` expression unpacks the input tuple of tuples and groups corresponding elements together from each tuple. For example, if the input is `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, `zip(*tuples)` would yield `[(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]`.

- The list comprehension then calculates the average of each group by summing the values and dividing by the number of tuples. The `len(tuples)` expression correctly gives the number of tuples, and `sum(val)` correctly sums the values in each group.

This approach correctly handles tuples of any length and any number of tuples, as long as all tuples have the same length. It will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the input tuple of tuples is empty, which is a reasonable behavior. However, it's worth noting that the problem description does not specify what to do in this case.

To make the function more robust, you could add a check to handle the case where the input tuple of tuples is empty:

```python
def func_1(tuples):
    if not tuples:
        return []
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

But as it stands, the program correctly implements the described behavior for all non-empty inputs with tuples of the same length.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers.
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list of averages, where each average corresponds to the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples in `tuples`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
