You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. 

Here's why it works:

- The `zip(*tuples)` expression unpacks the input tuple of tuples and groups corresponding elements together from each tuple. For example, if the input is `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, `zip(*tuples)` would yield `[(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]`.

- The list comprehension then calculates the average of each group by summing the values and dividing by the number of tuples. The `len(tuples)` expression correctly gives the number of tuples, and `sum(val)` correctly sums the values in each group.

This approach correctly handles tuples of any length and any number of tuples, as long as all tuples have the same length. It will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the input tuple of tuples is empty, which is a reasonable behavior. However, it's worth noting that the problem description does not specify what to do in this case.

To make the function more robust, you could add a check to handle the case where the input tuple of tuples is empty:

```python
def func_1(tuples):
    if not tuples:
        return []
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

But as it stands, the program correctly implements the described behavior for all non-empty inputs with tuples of the same length.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple of tuples with numbers of the same length, and returns a list of averages where each average corresponds to the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples, but it may raise exceptions for invalid inputs such as empty tuples, non-numeric values, or tuples of different lengths.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
