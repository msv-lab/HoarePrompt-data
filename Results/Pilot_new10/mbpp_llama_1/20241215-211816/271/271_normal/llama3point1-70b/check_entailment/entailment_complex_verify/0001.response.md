The original assessment claims that the provided program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. The assessment provides a detailed explanation of how the program works, including the use of the `zip(*tuples)` function to transpose the tuples and calculate the averages.

The annotated version of the code confirms the explanation provided in the original assessment. The annotations describe the state of the program before the function call, the return value of the function, and the overall behavior of the function. The annotations also mention that the function may raise exceptions for invalid inputs, but this is not a concern based on the problem description, which assumes that the input will be valid.

Based on the information provided, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the averages of the corresponding values from each tuple, and the annotations confirm the explanation provided in the original assessment.

The reason why the original assessment is accurate is that the program correctly implements the required functionality. The `zip(*tuples)` function transposes the tuples, and the list comprehension calculates the averages of the corresponding values. The annotations provided with the code confirm that the function behaves as expected, and the original assessment correctly explains how the program works.

Final: **True**
