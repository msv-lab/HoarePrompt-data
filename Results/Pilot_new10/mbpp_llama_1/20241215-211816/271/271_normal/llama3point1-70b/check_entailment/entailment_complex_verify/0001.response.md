The original assessment is "None", which means there is no initial assessment provided. 

Upon analyzing the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1(tuples)` seems to be correct. It takes a tuple of tuples, uses the `zip(*tuples)` function to transpose the tuples, and then calculates the average of each position.

The annotated code provides additional information about the state of the program at different points. It describes the input as a tuple of tuples with the same length and containing numbers, and the output as a list of averages where each average corresponds to the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples.

Considering the problem description and the annotated code, the function `func_1(tuples)` appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple.

However, as the annotated code mentions, this function may raise exceptions for invalid inputs such as empty tuples, non-numeric values, or tuples of different lengths. But according to the problem description, we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Final: **True**
