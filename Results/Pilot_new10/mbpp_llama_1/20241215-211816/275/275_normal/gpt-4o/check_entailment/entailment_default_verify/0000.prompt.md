You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided code correctly finds the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. It uses dynamic programming to achieve this. 

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, since an empty list has no subsets.

2. The list `nums` is then sorted in ascending order. This is done to ensure that for every pair of numbers in the list, the smaller number comes first.

3. A list `dp` is created, where `dp[i]` will store the size of the largest subset that ends with `nums[i]`. The list `dp` is initialized with all elements set to 1, since a single number is always a subset of size 1.

4. The function then iterates over the list `nums`. For each number `nums[i]`, it checks all previous numbers `nums[j]`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it means that `nums[i]` can be appended to the subset that ends with `nums[j]`. In this case, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j]` plus 1.

5. Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the size of the largest subset that meets the condition.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. The use of dynamic programming ensures that the code has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. 

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the code, as it returns the expected results for different input cases. 

Therefore, the code is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers and returns 0 if the list is empty, or the length of the longest chain of divisors among all numbers in the sorted list, where a chain of divisors is defined as a sequence of numbers where each number is divisible by the previous number in the sequence

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
