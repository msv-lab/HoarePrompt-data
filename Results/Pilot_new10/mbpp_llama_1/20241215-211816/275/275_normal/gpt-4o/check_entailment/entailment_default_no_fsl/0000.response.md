Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a solution to the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, sorts the list in ascending order, and then uses dynamic programming to find the longest chain of divisors.

The dynamic programming approach works by initializing a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at index `i`. The code then iterates through the list and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the current number is divisible by the previous number. If it is, it updates the length of the chain of divisors for the current number.

The function returns the maximum length of the chain of divisors found.

The code handles the edge case where the input list is empty by returning 0. It also correctly handles cases where there are multiple chains of divisors, returning the length of the longest one.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also pass, indicating that the function works correctly for the given examples. The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns the length of the longest chain of divisors among all numbers in the sorted list.

After examining the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work as expected. The code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to find the longest chain of divisors, and it handles all edge cases. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.
