The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly finds the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. The dynamic programming approach used in the function ensures that it finds the longest divisible subset efficiently. The output hints provided also match the expected functionality of the function.

The function works by sorting the list of numbers and then iterating over the list to find the longest chain of divisors. The DP array `dp` stores the length of the longest divisible subset ending at each position, and the function returns the maximum value in the DP array, which represents the size of the largest subset of numbers where every pair is divisible.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning 0 for an empty list and the length of the longest chain of divisors for a non-empty list. The hints also clarify that the function considers a chain of divisors as a sequence of numbers where each number is divisible by the previous number in the sequence.

Therefore, based on the provided code, the problem description, and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
