You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a solution to the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. After analyzing the code, I believe it meets the requirements of the problem description.

The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input, sorts them, and initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with all elements set to 1. The DP array stores the length of the longest divisible subset ending at each position.

The code then iterates over the list of numbers, and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the current number is divisible by the previous number. If it is, it updates the DP array with the maximum length of the divisible subset.

The function returns the maximum value in the DP array, which represents the size of the largest subset of numbers where every pair is divisible.

I have analyzed the code and tested it with various inputs, and it seems to work correctly for all cases. The code handles edge cases such as an empty list and a list with a single element correctly. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the code finds the longest divisible subset efficiently.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected, and all the provided test cases pass correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of integers, and the list is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`, where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors for `nums[i]`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the length of the longest chain of divisors among all numbers in the sorted list 'nums'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns 0 if the list is empty, or the length of the longest chain of divisors among all numbers in the sorted list, where a chain of divisors is defined as a sequence of numbers where each number is divisible by the previous number in the sequence

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
