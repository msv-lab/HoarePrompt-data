According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and not empty, and `dp` reflects the chains of divisors up to the current `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` will take values from 0 to `i-1`. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and not empty, `dp` reflects the chains of divisors up to the current `i`, `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
