Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and not empty, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, reflecting the updated chain of divisors. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`, then the state of `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
