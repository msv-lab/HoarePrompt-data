The value of `dp[i]` becomes the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j]` plus 1. The value of `i` is greater than 1, and the value of `j` is 1. The list `nums` is still a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and not empty, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + 1`**
