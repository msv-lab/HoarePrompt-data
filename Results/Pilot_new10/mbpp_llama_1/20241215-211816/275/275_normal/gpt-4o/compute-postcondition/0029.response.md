To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, not empty, and has at least one more element than the original `nums`.
- `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`.
- `i` is equal to the length of the current `nums` minus 1.

The loop statement is `for i in range(len(nums)):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is equal to the length of the current `nums` minus 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `nums`. Since `i` is currently at the last index of `nums`, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, but since it's already at the last index, it actually needs the length of `nums` to increase by 1 (or more) so that `i` can still be less than the length of `nums` after incrementing.

However, the provided setup indicates that `nums` has "at least one more element than the original `nums`", but it doesn't imply that `nums` will dynamically change its length during the loop iterations based on the loop itself. The loop iterates over the range of `nums` as it is at the start of the loop. Therefore, the adjustment of state is based on the current iteration's end state and what is needed for the next iteration to occur, given the loop's condition.

Thus, considering the nature of the `for` loop in Python, which doesn't dynamically adjust its iteration range based on changes to the iterated-over object during iteration, the crucial point is whether `i` is within the bounds of `nums` for the next iteration. Given `i` is at the end of `nums` and we're considering the loop continuing, the misunderstanding might come from trying to apply dynamic changes to `nums` during the loop, which isn't how a `for` loop over a range works in Python.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, not empty, and the loop's ability to continue depends on its predefined range, `dp` reflects the chains of divisors up to the current `i`, `i` would conceptually need to be incremented to continue, but given it's a `for` loop, the iteration range is fixed at the loop's start.**
