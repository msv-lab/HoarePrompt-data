According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. So, `j` becomes 1. 
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and not empty, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
