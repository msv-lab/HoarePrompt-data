According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, and `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1. This ensures that the loop will execute at least once. For the loop to execute, `i` must be initialized to 0, which is the starting index of the range.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1, `i` is 0**
