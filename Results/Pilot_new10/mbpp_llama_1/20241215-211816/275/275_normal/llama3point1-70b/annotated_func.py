#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of integers, and the list is not empty

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where for each `i`, `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for any number in the list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, returns 0 if the list is empty, and otherwise returns the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for any number in the list, assuming the input list only contains integers and is not extremely large. If the input list contains non-integer values, non-numeric values, or is None, the function's behavior is undefined.
