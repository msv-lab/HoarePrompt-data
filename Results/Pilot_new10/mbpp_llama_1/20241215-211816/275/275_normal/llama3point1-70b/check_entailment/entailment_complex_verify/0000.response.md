The problem description requires a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible. The original assessment states that the function `func_1(nums)` correctly implements a dynamic programming approach to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. 

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the original assessment is not entirely accurate. The function `func_1(nums)` actually implements a dynamic programming approach to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every number is divisible by the previous numbers in the subset, not necessarily every pair.

The annotated version of the code supports this interpretation. It states that `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, which means that the function is finding the largest subset where each number is divisible by the previous numbers, not necessarily every pair.

The key difference here is that the function is not checking if every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible, but rather if each number is divisible by the previous numbers. For example, if the input list is [2, 4, 8, 16], the function will return 4, because each number is divisible by the previous numbers. However, if the input list is [2, 4, 6, 8], the function will not return 4, because although 2 and 4 are divisible, 2 and 6 are not.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
