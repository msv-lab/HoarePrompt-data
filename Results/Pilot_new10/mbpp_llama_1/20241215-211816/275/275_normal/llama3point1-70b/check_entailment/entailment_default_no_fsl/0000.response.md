Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a solution to the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair is divisible. The code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. 

Here is a step-by-step explanation of why the code works for every potential case:

1. **Handling empty list**: The code checks if the input list `nums` is empty, in which case it returns 0. This is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

2. **Sorting the list**: The code sorts the input list `nums` in ascending order. This is done to ensure that the dynamic programming approach works correctly, as we are comparing each number with all previous numbers to check for divisibility.

3. **Dynamic programming**: The code initializes a list `dp` with the same length as `nums`, where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subset of divisors ending at index `i`. It then iterates over each number in the sorted list, and for each number, it checks all previous numbers to see if they are divisors. If a previous number is a divisor, it updates the length of the longest subset of divisors for the current number.

4. **Returning the result**: The code returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which represents the length of the largest subset of divisors.

The code handles all potential cases:

- **Empty list**: The code returns 0 for an empty list, which is the correct behavior.
- **List with a single element**: The code returns 1 for a list with a single element, which is the correct behavior.
- **List with multiple elements**: The code uses dynamic programming to find the length of the largest subset of divisors, which is the correct approach.

Overall, the code correctly solves the problem and handles all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
