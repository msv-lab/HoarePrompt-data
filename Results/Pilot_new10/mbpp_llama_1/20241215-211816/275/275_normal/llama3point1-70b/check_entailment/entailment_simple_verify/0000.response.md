To assess the correctness of the provided Python function `func_1(nums)` based on the problem description and the annotated version, let's break down the key points:

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible.

2. **Original Assessment**: The assessment concludes that the function is correct. It outlines the dynamic programming approach used by the function, which sorts the list of numbers and then iterates through the list to find the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

3. **Annotated Code**: The annotations describe the state of the program at different points, including before and after the if block, after sorting, and after the nested for loops. These annotations indicate that the function calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for each number in the sorted list.

Given these points, let's evaluate the correctness of the function:

- The **problem description** asks for the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible.
- The **original assessment** correctly identifies the approach taken by the function and concludes it's correct based on that approach.
- The **annotated code** indicates that the function calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for each number in the list, which aligns with the goal of finding subsets where every pair is divisible, given the context that the list is sorted.

However, upon closer inspection, there's a critical point to consider:

- The function's approach ensures that for any pair of numbers in the subset, the larger number is divisible by the smaller one. This is a necessary condition for the problem but might not be sufficient on its own to guarantee that every pair in the subset is divisible.

The key insight from the annotated code and the original assessment is that the function indeed implements a dynamic programming approach to find the largest subset where the divisibility condition is met, but with the clarification that it focuses on sequences where each number can be divided by the previous ones in the sequence.

Upon reconsideration, the function seems to be solving a specific interpretation of the problem that focuses on finding the longest chain of divisors rather than the largest subset where any two elements are divisible. However, the problem statement's phrasing "every pair is divisible" could imply a slightly different structure than what the function provides.

Given this nuanced understanding and considering the strict format for the response, the evaluation hinges on whether the function correctly implements a solution to the stated problem based on the annotations and the original assessment.

**Final: False**

The reason for concluding that the original assessment is not entirely accurate is that the function's approach, while correct in its implementation, might not fully address the problem's requirement as it focuses on sequences of divisors rather than subsets where every pair of elements is divisible. The problem statement's ambiguity and the function's specific implementation strategy lead to this conclusion.
