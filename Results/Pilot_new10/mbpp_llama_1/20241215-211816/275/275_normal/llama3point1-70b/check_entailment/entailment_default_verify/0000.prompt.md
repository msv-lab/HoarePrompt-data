You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` correctly implements a dynamic programming approach to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. Here's why:

1. The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, which is correct because an empty list cannot have a non-empty subset.

2. The function then sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. This is done to ensure that for any pair of numbers, the smaller number comes first, which is necessary for the dynamic programming approach to work correctly.

3. The function initializes a list `dp` of the same length as `nums`, where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset ending at index `i` such that every pair is divisible. The list `dp` is initialized with all elements set to 1, which means that every number itself forms a subset of size 1.

4. The function then iterates over the list `nums` from the second element to the last element. For each element at index `i`, it iterates over the previous elements (from the first element to the element at index `i-1`). If the current element at index `i` is divisible by any of the previous elements, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element.

5. Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the size of the largest subset such that every pair is divisible.

This approach is correct because it considers all possible subsets and ensures that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible. The dynamic programming approach allows the function to efficiently compute the solution by building up the solution from smaller subproblems.

The function handles all edge cases correctly, including the case where the input list is empty, the case where the list contains only one element, and the case where the list contains multiple elements. It also handles cases where the numbers in the list are not necessarily distinct.

Overall, the provided Python function `func_1(nums)` is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, returns 0 if the list is empty, and otherwise returns the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for any number in the list, assuming the input list only contains integers and is not extremely large. If the input list contains non-integer values, non-numeric values, or is None, the function's behavior is undefined.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
