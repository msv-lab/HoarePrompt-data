The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` ranges from `i-1` down to 0. The value of `dp[i]` will be equal to the maximum value of `dp[j]` for all `j` less than `i`, plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 5 elements, `i` is equal to the new length of `nums` and is greater than 0, `dp` has a length equal to the new length of `nums` and `dp[i]` is the maximum value of `dp[j]` for all `j` less than `i`, plus 1, `j` will range from `i-1` down to 0**
