The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `i` is at least 3 and `j` is 2, and `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, the values of `nums` and `j` are not affected. The value of `i` is also not changed. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 2, and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2] + 1`.
Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 2, and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2] + 1`**
