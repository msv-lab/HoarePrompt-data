To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i):`, which means `j` will take on values from 0 to `i-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `i` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to increment by 1.

Given that `j` is currently 1 and `i` is greater than 1, for the loop to continue, `j` should be less than `i`. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 2 (incremented from 1), and `i` remains greater than 1 but must be at least 3 for `j` to reach 2.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 2**
