Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 5 elements, `i` is equal to the new length of `nums` and is greater than 0, `dp` has a length equal to the new length of `nums`. If there exists a `j` less than `i` such that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum value of `dp[j]` for all such `j`, plus 1.***
