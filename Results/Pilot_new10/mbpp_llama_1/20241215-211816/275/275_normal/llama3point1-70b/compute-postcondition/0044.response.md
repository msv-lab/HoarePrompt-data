The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums`. According to the annotations, if the list is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function sorts the list in ascending order. It then initializes a list `dp` where each element represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors ending at the corresponding number in the sorted list. The function iterates over the sorted list, updating the `dp` list based on whether a number is divisible by a previous number. Finally, the function returns the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for any number in the list.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the function does not handle cases where the input list contains non-integer values or non-numeric values. Additionally, the function does not check for cases where the input list is `None`. The function also assumes that the input list is not extremely large, as the time complexity of the sorting operation and the nested loops could be significant for large inputs.

Based on the code, the function seems to correctly implement the logic for finding the longest increasing subsequence of divisors, but it does not include any error checking or handling for edge cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers, returns 0 if the list is empty, and otherwise returns the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for any number in the list, assuming the input list only contains integers and is not extremely large. If the input list contains non-integer values, non-numeric values, or is None, the function's behavior is undefined. **
