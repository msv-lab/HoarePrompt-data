The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The current value of `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` can be divided by `nums[j]` without leaving a remainder. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `i` is greater than 0. The `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` and has at least one more element. `j` is 0. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `i` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, `j` is 0**
