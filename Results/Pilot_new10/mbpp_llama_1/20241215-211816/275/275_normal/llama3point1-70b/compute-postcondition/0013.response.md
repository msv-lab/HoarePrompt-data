According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since the loop iterates over the range of `i`, which is currently 2, the maximum value `j` can take is `i-1`, which is 1. 

After the last iteration, if `nums[2]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, then `dp[2]` is updated accordingly, but this does not affect the loop condition. The state of `nums` and `dp` may have changed, but this does not affect the loop condition.

Since `j` is now 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 2 (to allow `j` to be 1). However, `i` is not changed within the loop, so it remains 2. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
