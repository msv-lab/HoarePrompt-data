Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. The current value of `nums[i]` is a multiple of the current value of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` with no remainder.**
