To solve this, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

Given:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements.
- `i` is equal to the original length of `nums` and must be greater than 0.
- `dp` has a length equal to the length of `nums` with `dp[i-1]` being the maximum length of the increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i-1]`.
- `j` will range from `i-1` down to 0.
- The current value of `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` can be divided by `nums[j]` without leaving a remainder.

Code:
```python
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

This line of code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is an index such that `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`. This essentially checks if including `nums[j]` in the increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` would increase the length of the subsequence.

Impact and Result:
- The value of `dp[i]` is updated based on whether including `nums[j]` in the subsequence increases its length.
- Since `nums` is sorted and `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, `dp[j] + 1` represents the potential length of an increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` that includes `nums[j]`.
- The states of `nums`, `i`, and the overall structure of `dp` (except for `dp[i]`) are not altered by this operation.
- `j`'s value or range is not directly affected by this line of code, but its relationship with `i` and the values in `nums` and `dp` is crucial for determining the update to `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `i` is equal to the original length of `nums` and is greater than 0, `dp` has a length equal to the length of `nums` with `dp[i]` being the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1` where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and `j` ranges from `i-1` down to 0.**
