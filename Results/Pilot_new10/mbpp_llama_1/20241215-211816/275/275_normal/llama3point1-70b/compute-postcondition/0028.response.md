To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i):
    if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```
This loop iterates over the indices `j` from 0 to `i-1` and checks if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If it is, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

From the output states after a few iterations, we can see that:

* After 1 iteration, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is updated if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[0]`.
* After 2 iterations, `j` is 1, and `dp[i]` is updated if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[1]`.
* After 3 iterations, `j` is 2, and `dp[i]` is updated if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[2]`.

We can generalize this pattern to conclude that after all iterations of the loop, `dp[i]` will be updated to be the maximum length of the increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.

The loop will execute at least once if `i` is greater than 0, which means `nums` must have at least two elements. However, since the initial state specifies that `nums` has at least 3 elements, the loop will always execute.

If the loop does not execute (which is not possible in this case), the values of the variables would remain unchanged, with `dp[i]` retaining its original value.

After all iterations of the loop, the values of the variables will be:

* `nums` will remain the same, as a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements.
* `i` will remain the same, as the length of `nums` minus 1 (considering the original length of `nums`).
* `dp[i]` will be the maximum length of the increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
* `j` will be `i-1`, as the loop iterates over the indices `j` from 0 to `i-1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is equal to the original length of `nums` minus 1, `dp[i]` is the maximum length of the increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `j` is `i-1`.**
