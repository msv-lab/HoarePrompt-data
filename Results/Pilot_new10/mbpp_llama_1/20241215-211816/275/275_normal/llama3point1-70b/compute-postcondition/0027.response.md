Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2] + 1`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`, then the state of `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
