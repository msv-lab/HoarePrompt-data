Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `i` is equal to the original length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, `dp` has a length equal to the length of `nums` with `dp[i-1]` being the maximum length of the increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i-1]`, and `j` will range from `i-1` down to 0. The current value of `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` can be divided by `nums[j]` without leaving a remainder.**
