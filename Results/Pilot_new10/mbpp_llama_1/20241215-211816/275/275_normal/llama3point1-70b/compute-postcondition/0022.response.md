According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `j` is now 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 1.
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is greater than 1, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged, and `j` is 1**
