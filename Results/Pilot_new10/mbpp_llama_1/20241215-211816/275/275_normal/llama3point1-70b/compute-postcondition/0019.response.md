Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `i` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` and has at least one more element, `j` is 0. The current value of `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` can be divided by `nums[j]` without leaving a remainder.**
