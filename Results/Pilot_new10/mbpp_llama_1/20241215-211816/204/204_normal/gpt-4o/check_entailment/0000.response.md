Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The function then returns `True` if the input month is in the set and `False` otherwise.

The function correctly handles all 12 months of the year. The months with 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which are all included in the set. The function also correctly returns `False` for the months with fewer than 31 days, which are February (2), April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

All the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Since the function correctly handles all possible inputs and the unit tests pass, the program is considered correct.
