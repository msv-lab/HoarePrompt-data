The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version of the code also supports the original assessment. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not, and the provided unit tests cover various cases, confirming the function's correctness.

The function uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. This approach ensures efficient lookups and accurate results. The function's return statement correctly identifies the months with 31 days and returns `True` for these months, while returning `False` for the months with fewer than 31 days.

The annotations in the code also clarify the program's state and behavior at different points, reinforcing the conclusion that the program is correct. The assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program is also reasonable in this context, as the problem description and the code do not imply any error handling requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations.

Final: **True**
