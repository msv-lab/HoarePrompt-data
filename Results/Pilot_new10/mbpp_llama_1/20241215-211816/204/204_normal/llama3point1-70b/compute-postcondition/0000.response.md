The given Python code defines a list `months_31_days` that contains the months of the year with 31 days. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer representing a month of the year, where 1 <= n <= 12.

The code does not modify the value of `n`. It only defines a new list `months_31_days`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 12, `months_31_days` is a list equal to [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]**
