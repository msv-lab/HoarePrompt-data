To calculate the output state, we need to consider the possible values of `n` and the content of `months_31_days`. 

`n` can be any integer from 1 to 12. 
`months_31_days` is a list of integers representing the months of the year that have 31 days: [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12].

The code `return n in months_31_days` checks if the value of `n` is present in the list `months_31_days`.

If `n` is one of the values in `months_31_days` (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), the program returns `True`, indicating that the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days.

If `n` is not one of the values in `months_31_days` (2, 4, 6, 9, 11), the program returns `False`, indicating that the month corresponding to `n` does not have 31 days.

Therefore, the program returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days.

Output State: **The program returns True if the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days, False otherwise**
