Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, I believe the original assessment is accurate. 

The problem description requires a function that checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly implements this functionality. It uses a list `months_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days and then checks if the input `n` is in this list.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function works as expected. The state of the program right before the function call is as expected, with `n` being an integer representing a month of the year. The function then correctly returns `True` if the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days and `False` otherwise.

The original assessment correctly notes that the function handles all possible valid inputs correctly and returns the expected results. Since we are assuming that the input will always be valid, the function's lack of error handling for invalid inputs does not affect its correctness.

Therefore, I agree with the original assessment that the function is correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
