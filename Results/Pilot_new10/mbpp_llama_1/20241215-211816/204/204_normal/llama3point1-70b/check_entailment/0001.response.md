Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It achieves this by defining a list `months_31_days` that includes the month numbers (1-indexed) corresponding to January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which are the months with 31 days in the Gregorian calendar. The function then returns `True` if the input month number `n` is in this list and `False` otherwise.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description:
- For month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, the function correctly returns `True` since these months have 31 days.
- For month numbers 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11, the function correctly returns `False` since these months do not have 31 days in the standard Gregorian calendar.
- For any other integer inputs outside the range of 1 to 12, the function will also return `False`, which aligns with the assumption that invalid month numbers (outside 1-12) do not have 31 days, although the problem description does not explicitly address input validation for month numbers beyond the 1-12 range.

Given the straightforward and accurate implementation of the function according to the problem description, and considering the standard Gregorian calendar month lengths, the code is correct for all potential cases related to the months of the year.
