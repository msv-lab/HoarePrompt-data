Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing a month of the year and checks if the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days.

The months with 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which are correctly included in the `months_31_days` list.

For every potential case, the function will return `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise, exactly as specified in the problem description. Here's why:

- The problem description asks for a month to be classified based on whether it contains 31 days or not.
- The `months_31_days` list covers all months with 31 days according to the Gregorian calendar (and most other calendars that would be relevant).
- The `return n in months_31_days` statement directly checks if the month number `n` is among those months listed to have 31 days, fulfilling the requirement.

Given the proper initialization of `n` as described in the comments (where `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 12), the function correctly handles every month of the year as intended, aligning with the problem description's requirements.
