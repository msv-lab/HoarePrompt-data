Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` is correct and follows the problem description. It removes all lowercase characters from a given string, effectively achieving the goal of removing lowercase substrings. 

Here's why it works:

1. The list comprehension `[char for char in s if char.isupper()]` iterates over each character in the input string `s`.
2. The `char.isupper()` condition filters out characters that are not uppercase, only keeping uppercase characters in the list.
3. The `''.join(...)` method concatenates the uppercase characters back into a string, which is then returned by the function.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness, as they show that the function correctly removes lowercase characters and returns the expected results.

It's worth noting that the function's approach to removing lowercase substrings is to remove all lowercase characters, which is equivalent to removing all substrings that contain lowercase characters, because any substring that contains a lowercase character will have that character removed. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
