The problem description requires writing a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided code and output hints suggest that the function actually removes all lowercase characters, not lowercase substrings. This is a significant difference because removing lowercase substrings would require a different approach than simply filtering out lowercase characters.

The code provided uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string and includes it in the output only if it is an uppercase character. This effectively removes all lowercase characters from the string, not just lowercase substrings.

The output hints support this interpretation, stating that the function accepts a string and returns a new string containing all the uppercase characters from the input string. This description aligns with the behavior of the provided code.

Given the discrepancy between the problem description and the code's behavior as described by the output hints, the original assessment (which is none) does not accurately reflect the correctness of the program regarding the specific problem description of removing lowercase substrings.

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description because it removes all lowercase characters instead of specifically targeting and removing lowercase substrings.

Final: **False**
