You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'

def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem statement asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided code removes all lowercase characters, not just substrings.

For example, if we have the string 'aBa', the code will return 'B', which is incorrect because it should remove the entire substring 'a' and return 'Ba'. However, in this specific implementation, the code is actually removing all lowercase characters, not just substrings. 

A correct implementation should iterate through the string, checking for substrings that are entirely in lowercase and removing them. However, the provided code does not do this.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to modify the function to identify and remove sequences of lowercase characters, not just individual lowercase characters. 

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: 
Let's consider the string 'AbcDEf'. The program will return 'ADE', which is incorrect because it should remove the entire substring 'bc' and return 'ADEF'.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
    #The program returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string `s`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
