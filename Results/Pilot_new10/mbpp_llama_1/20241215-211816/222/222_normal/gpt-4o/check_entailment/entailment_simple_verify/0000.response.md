The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it removes all lowercase characters from the string instead of removing lowercase substrings. However, upon closer inspection of the problem description, unit tests, and the annotated version of the code, it seems that the intention of the function is indeed to filter out all lowercase characters, not specifically to identify and remove lowercase substrings.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'` and `assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'`, suggest that the expected behavior is to remove individual lowercase characters, not sequences of them. The annotated version of the code also implies this, as it states that the program returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string `s`.

Given this information, it appears that the original assessment is not entirely accurate. The program does indeed behave as expected according to the provided unit tests and the annotated version of the code. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**.
