You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'

def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem statement asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided code removes all lowercase characters, not just substrings.

For example, if we have the string 'aBa', the code will return 'B', which is incorrect because it should remove the entire substring 'a' and return 'Ba'. However, in this specific implementation, the code is actually removing all lowercase characters, not just substrings. 

A correct implementation should iterate through the string, checking for substrings that are entirely in lowercase and removing them. However, the provided code does not do this.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to modify the function to identify and remove sequences of lowercase characters, not just individual lowercase characters. 

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: 
Let's consider the string 'AbcDEf'. The program will return 'ADE', which is incorrect because it should remove the entire substring 'bc' and return 'ADEF'.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing all the uppercase characters from `s`, in the order they appear in `s`. If `s` is empty or contains no uppercase characters, the function returns an empty string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
