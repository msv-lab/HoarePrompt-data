You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'

def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as it removes all lowercase characters from the string instead of removing lowercase substrings. It treats each character individually, checking if it's uppercase or not, and only keeps the uppercase characters. This approach does not consider sequences of lowercase characters as substrings to be removed but rather filters out individual lowercase characters.

For example, if the input string is "aBa", the function would return "B", which is correct. However, the issue here is with the interpretation of "removing lowercase substrings." In the context of strings and substring manipulation, one might expect the function to remove sequences of lowercase characters, not just individual lowercase characters. However, based on the unit tests provided, it seems the intention might indeed be to simply filter out all lowercase characters, not to remove substrings in the way that term might be understood in a more general context.

Given the unit tests and the simplistic nature of the function, it seems the function is intended to filter out all lowercase characters, not specifically to identify and remove lowercase substrings (which could be a more complex operation involving pattern recognition or at least a different approach to string manipulation). 

A true test of this function's correctness according to a stricter interpretation of "removing lowercase substrings" would involve inputs where the sequence of characters matters, such as "aBa" or similar. However, the provided unit tests suggest a simpler interpretation where any character that is lowercase should be removed, regardless of its position or the positions of other characters.

Therefore, if considering the task as removing any sequence of lowercase characters as substrings, the function does not correctly fulfill this task because it doesn't handle sequences; it treats each character individually. But based on the unit tests provided, which only check the filtering of individual lowercase characters, the function behaves as expected. If the intention was indeed to remove all lowercase characters, the function is correct according to the given assertions but incorrect if a more complex interpretation of "removing lowercase substrings" is considered.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
    #The program returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string `s`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
