The original assessment claims that the provided function `func_1(s)` does not correctly implement the task of removing lowercase substrings from a given string. However, upon closer examination of the problem description and the provided code, it appears that the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description specifically asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. The function `func_1(s)` simply removes all lowercase characters from the string, which does not necessarily target substrings. A substring is a sequence of characters within a string, and the function does not explicitly identify and remove these sequences if they are entirely lowercase.

The output hints confirm that the function returns a new string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string, which aligns with the function's implementation but does not fulfill the task as described in the problem. The hints also mention that the function correctly handles edge cases like empty strings and strings with only lowercase characters but note a potential error if the input is not a string, which is outside the scope of assessing the function's correctness based on the problem description.

The key point of contention is the interpretation of "removing lowercase substrings." The original assessment argues, correctly, that the task implies identifying sequences of characters that are all lowercase and removing these sequences, not just individual lowercase characters. The provided function does not make this distinction; it treats every lowercase character individually, regardless of its position within a substring.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the analysis provided, the original assessment that the function does not correctly implement the task for all potential cases remains accurate. The function's implementation does not align with the specific requirement of removing lowercase substrings, as it does not differentiate between individual lowercase characters and sequences of these characters.

Final: **False**
