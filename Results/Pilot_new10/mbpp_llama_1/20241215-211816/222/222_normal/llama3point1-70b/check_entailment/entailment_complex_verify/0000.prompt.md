You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1(s)` removes all lowercase characters from a given string `s`, leaving only the uppercase characters. However, according to the problem description, the task is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. 

A counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of this function is the string "AbcDE". The function `func_1(s)` will return "ADE", which is correct in removing the lowercase characters, but it does not specifically target substrings that are entirely lowercase. 

A more accurate interpretation of the task would involve identifying sequences of characters that are all lowercase and removing those sequences, rather than simply filtering out individual lowercase characters.

For instance, if the input string is "AbcDEfghIJ", the correct output according to the problem description should ideally be "ADEIJ" because "bc" and "fgh" are the substrings that are entirely lowercase and should be removed. However, the provided function will only remove individual lowercase characters, not sequences identified as substrings. 

Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the described task for all potential cases, particularly those involving the distinction between individual characters and substrings.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the original string, `result` is a string containing all the uppercase characters from `s`, `char` is the last character in `s`.
    return result
    #The program returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string and returns a new string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string. It correctly handles empty strings and strings with only lowercase characters, returning an empty string in these cases. However, it may throw an error if the input is not a string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
