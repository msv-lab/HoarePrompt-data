You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1(s)` is removing all lowercase characters from the string, not substrings. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The program should identify and remove sequences of lowercase characters, not individual characters.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program should return "HW" because "ello" and "orld" are lowercase substrings. However, the given program will return "HW" which is correct in this case, but it will not work correctly for all cases, like if the input string is "aAa" the program will return "A" which is correct but if the string is "aaAaa" the program will return "A" which is also correct. But the problem with the program is it is not handling the case correctly where the string contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters and the task is to remove the lowercase substrings.

However a case that will not work as expected is when a string has both upper and lowercase characters like "AAaaBB", the function will return "AABB", in this case it's working as expected but it's removing individual characters not substrings. 

But the best example to show the program is not working is when the task is to remove the lowercase substrings from a given string like "AaaBbbC" in this case the program will return "ABC" which is correct but the program does not meet the requirements of the task because it removes individual characters, not substrings.

The correct way to solve this problem is to iterate through the string and check for sequences of lowercase characters, then remove those sequences. 

Here is a simple example of how it can be done:

```python
def remove_lowercase_substrings(s):
    result = ''
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i].islower():
            # find the end of the lowercase substring
            j = i + 1
            while j < len(s) and s[j].islower():
                j += 1
            # skip the lowercase substring
            i = j
        else:
            result += s[i]
            i += 1
    return result
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string and returns a new string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string. It correctly handles empty strings and strings with only lowercase characters, returning an empty string in these cases. However, it may throw an error if the input is not a string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
