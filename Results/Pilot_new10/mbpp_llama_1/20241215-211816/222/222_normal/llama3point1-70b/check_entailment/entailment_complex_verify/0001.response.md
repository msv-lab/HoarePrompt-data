The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it removes individual lowercase characters instead of lowercase substrings. This assessment is accurate. 

The problem description requires the program to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided code only removes individual lowercase characters, not substrings. 

The annotated version of the code confirms this, stating that the function returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string, which means it is removing individual lowercase characters, not substrings.

The correct way to solve this problem is to iterate through the string and check for sequences of lowercase characters, then remove those sequences. The provided example code demonstrates this approach.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect based on the problem description.

Final: **False**
