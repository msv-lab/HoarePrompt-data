Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the program only removes lowercase characters, not substrings.

For example, if the input string is "AbcdEF", the program will return "AEF", which is correct in the sense that it removed all lowercase characters. However, if the input string is "ABCdefGHI", the program will also return "ABCGHI", which is again removing all lowercase characters, but not specifically removing lowercase substrings.

The key difference is that a substring is a sequence of characters within a string, and the program should remove these sequences if they are lowercase, not just individual characters. The program does not handle cases where a lowercase substring is followed by an uppercase character, or where a lowercase substring is at the beginning or end of the string.

To correctly implement the problem description, the program should iterate over the string and identify sequences of lowercase characters, removing these sequences from the string. The current program does not achieve this. 

Here is a simple example of a case where the program does not follow the problem description: 

If we input "aBCd", according to the problem description, the output should be "BC" if we consider "a" and "d" as two separate lowercase substrings, and the program indeed returns "BC". However, in the case where we input "abcdEF", the program returns "EF", but it does not specifically remove the substring "abcd" because it's a sequence of lowercase characters; it simply removes all lowercase characters individually. 

In summary, while the program appears to work correctly for certain cases, it does not accurately meet the requirements of the problem description to remove lowercase substrings, as it does not handle sequences of characters as a whole, but rather individual characters. 

To fix this, we would need a program that can identify sequences of lowercase characters and remove them as a whole, which the current program does not do. 

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    temp = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            temp += char
        else:
            if temp:
                temp = ''
            result += char
    return result
```
