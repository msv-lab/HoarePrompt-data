According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string and `result` is an empty string. For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least 1 character and `char` must be the first character in the string.

State: **`s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `result` is an empty string, `char` is the first character in the string**
