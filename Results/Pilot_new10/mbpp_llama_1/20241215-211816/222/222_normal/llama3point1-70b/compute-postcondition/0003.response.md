The code `result += char` appends the value of `char` to the end of the string `result`. Given the initial state, `result` is an empty string and `char` is the first character in the string `s` which is an uppercase letter. 

After executing the code, the value of `result` becomes the first character of `s` (which is an uppercase letter), and the values of `s` and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the string `s` and is an uppercase letter, `result` is a string equal to the first character of `s`.**
