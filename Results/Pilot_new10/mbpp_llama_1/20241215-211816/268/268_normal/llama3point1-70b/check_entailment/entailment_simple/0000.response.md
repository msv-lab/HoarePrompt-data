To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to compare it against the problem description. The problem asks to write a function that returns the maximum value of the n'th column in a given matrix, where the matrix is represented as a list of lists.

The provided function is:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
```
However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the indexing used in the function. The problem description asks for the maximum value of the n'th column, but the function accesses the element at index `n - 1` in each row.

Given that Python uses 0-based indexing, if `n` represents the column number (starting from 1 as per the problem description's implication of "n'th column"), then accessing `row[n - 1]` might seem correct at first glance because it adjusts for the 0-based indexing. However, the actual issue lies in the fact that it doesn't directly align with the standard interpretation of column indexing in a matrix when described in the context of "n'th column" without explicitly stating that `n` is 1-indexed.

Nonetheless, interpreting the problem description and the code with the assumption that `n` is intended to be 1-indexed (meaning the first column is referred to as the "1st column"), the code should actually access `row[n]` if `n` were 0-indexed or directly use `row[n-1]` if `n` is 1-indexed and we're adjusting for Python's 0-based indexing. 

However, the more common and less ambiguous way to interpret the task would be to simply use `row[n]` without subtracting 1, assuming `n` is indeed intended to be a 0-indexed column number, which is not the case here as per the initial explanation.

But, if we strictly follow the given problem description and consider `n` as a 1-indexed value (where the first column is `n=1`), then the function should indeed return the maximum of the `n-1` indexed column, because in Python, the first element of any list is at index 0.

The issue with the provided function, however, lies not in its indexing but in its possible misinterpretation due to the description. It actually does what a typical "find max in nth column" function would do if `n` were considered 1-indexed, by effectively finding the max of the elements at index `n-1` across all rows.

But to be precise and avoid confusion, the correct function, given the usual conventions and clarity in communication, should ideally be described or adjusted to clearly reflect whether `n` is 0-indexed or 1-indexed. Assuming the problem intends `n` to specify the column in a 1-indexed manner (first column = 1, second column = 2, etc.), and given Python's 0-based indexing, the function as written attempts to align with this by using `n-1`. 

Yet, there's a critical oversight in the given function when considering all possible cases: it does not handle cases where the matrix might not be rectangular (i.e., all rows do not have the same number of columns), or where `n` might be out of range for certain rows, which could lead to an `IndexError`.

Given these considerations, the function does not fully align with general expectations for robustness and clarity in handling edge cases, even if it seems to attempt to solve the described problem under specific assumptions about `n` and the structure of the input matrix.

Correctness: **False**

The reason for this conclusion is not solely because of the indexing (since it could be argued to align with a 1-indexed interpretation of column numbers), but more so because the function does not include error checking for potential issues like non-rectangular matrices or `n` being out of range for certain rows, which are important considerations for a robust solution that strictly follows the problem description without making additional assumptions beyond what's provided.
