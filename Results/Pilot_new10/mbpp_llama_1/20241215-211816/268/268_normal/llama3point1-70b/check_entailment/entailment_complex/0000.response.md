Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for the maximum value in the n'th column, but the program returns the maximum value at index `n-1` across all rows. 

In Python, list indices start at 0, so the n'th column would be at index `n`, not `n-1`. If `n` is equal to the number of columns in the matrix, it will indeed raise an `IndexError`, but this is not the expected behavior as the problem description does not specify what to do in this case.

To meet the requirements, the function should return the maximum value at index `n` across all rows, not `n-1`. The correct function would be:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
```

This function will return the maximum value in the n'th column as required by the problem description. 

Additionally, the function should also include error checking to handle cases where `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix, as this will raise an `IndexError`. 

For example:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    if n >= len(matrix[0]):
        raise ValueError("n is out of range")
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
```

This function will raise a `ValueError` if `n` is out of range, which is a more informative error than an `IndexError`.
