Correctness: **True**

The given function, `func_1`, appears to be correct for finding the maximum value in the nth column of a given matrix. Here's why:

1. The function uses list comprehension to extract the nth column from the matrix: `[row[n] for row in matrix]`. This is a Pythonic and efficient way to achieve this.

2. It then uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in the extracted column.

3. The function assumes that the input matrix is a list of lists and that all inner lists have at least `n+1` elements (since list indices in Python are 0-based). If these assumptions are met, the function should work correctly for all valid inputs.

4. The unit tests provided also suggest that the function behaves as expected.

Since the code is simple and directly addresses the problem statement, and no edge cases or potential errors could be found, the code is considered correct. It correctly handles the task of finding the maximum value in a specified column of a matrix, as described in the problem statement. 

However, it is worth noting that the function does not include any error checking to handle potential edge cases, such as:
- An empty matrix.
- A matrix with rows of different lengths.
- A column index that is out of range.
- A non-integer column index.
- A non-list input.

If the function is intended to handle these cases, additional code would be needed to add error checking and handling. But based solely on the problem description and provided code, the function appears to be correct.
