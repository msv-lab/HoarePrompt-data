Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by returning the maximum value from the `n`-th column of the given matrix. The function uses list comprehension to extract the `n`-th column elements and then applies the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value.

The output hints agree with the code, as it returns the maximum value from the `n`-th column, provided that the matrix is not empty, `n` is a valid index, and all elements at index `n` are comparable. If the matrix is empty or `n` is out of range, the function may raise a `ValueError` or `IndexError`, respectively. If the elements at index `n` are not comparable, the function may raise a `TypeError`.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, as they demonstrate its behavior with different input matrices and column indices.

Overall, the code is correct and works as expected according to the problem description, and there are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle correctly.
