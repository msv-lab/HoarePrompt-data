Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a 2D list `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n` as input, and returns the maximum value from the elements at index `n` in each row of `matrix`. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function extracts the nth column from the matrix using a list comprehension: `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]`. This operation correctly extracts the elements at index `n` from each row.

2. The function then returns the maximum value from the extracted nth column using the built-in `max` function: `return max(nth_column)`. This operation correctly finds the maximum value among the extracted elements.

3. The function handles potential edge cases, such as an empty matrix, an out-of-range `n`, or non-comparable elements, by letting Python's built-in error handling mechanisms raise the corresponding exceptions (`ValueError`, `IndexError`, or `TypeError`).

4. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs. However, it's worth noting that more comprehensive testing would be necessary to ensure the function works correctly for all possible inputs.

In summary, the program is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality described in the problem description, and it handles potential edge cases by letting Python raise the corresponding exceptions.
