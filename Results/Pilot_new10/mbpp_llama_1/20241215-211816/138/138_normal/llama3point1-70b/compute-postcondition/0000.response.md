The code `index = array.index(element)` assigns the index of the `element` in the `array` to the variable `index`. This means that `index` will hold the position of the `element` in the `array` if the `element` is found. 

If the `element` is not found in the `array`, the code will raise a `ValueError`. However, since we are only considering the case where the code executes without errors, we assume that the `element` is present in the `array`.

The state of `array` and `element` remains unchanged as the code only reads from `array` and `element` and does not modify them. 

The value of `index` is now the index of `element` in `array`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `array` is a list of elements, `element` is a value that can be compared with the elements in the `array`, and `index` is the position of `element` in `array`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of elements, `element` is a value that can be compared with the elements in the `array`, and `index` is the position of `element` in `array`.**
