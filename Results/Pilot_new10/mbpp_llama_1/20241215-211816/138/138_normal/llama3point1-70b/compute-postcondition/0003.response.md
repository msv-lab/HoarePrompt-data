The program could raise a `ValueError` exception at `index = array.index(element)` if the `element` is not found in the `array`. This exception is raised because the `index()` method in Python returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element, and if the element is not found, it raises a `ValueError`.

If the `element` is found in the `array`, the function returns `True` along with the index of the `element` in the `array`. However, if the `element` is not found, the function catches the `ValueError` exception, returns `False`, and `-1` to indicate that the `element` is not present in the `array`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the try-except statement is: `array` is a list of elements, and `element` is a value. If `element` is found in `array`, the function returns `True` and the index of `element`, otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`.

Output State: **array is a list of elements, and element is a value. If element is found in array, the function returns True and the index of element, otherwise, it returns False and -1.**
