Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not handle the case where `array` is not a list, as mentioned in the output hints. Additionally, if `element` appears multiple times in `array`, the function will return the index of the first occurrence, but the problem description does not specify this behavior. 

For example, if the input is `func_1("hello", "l")`, the function will throw an error because `index()` method is a list method and strings are not lists. Similarly, if the input is `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3], 2)`, the function will return `(True, 1)`, which may or may not be the desired behavior, depending on the interpretation of the problem description. 

However, the biggest issue is when the input is `func_1("hello", "l")` or `func_1(123, 2)`. In this case, the function will throw an error because `index()` method is a list method and strings (or integers) are not lists. 

The function should be modified to handle these cases, for example, by checking the type of `array` before calling `index()`, or by specifying in the problem description that `array` must be a list and that if `element` appears multiple times, the index of the first occurrence will be returned. 

Here is a possible modification to the function to handle these cases:
```python
def func_1(array, element):
    if not isinstance(array, list):
        raise TypeError("Array must be a list")
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return (True, index)
    except ValueError:
        return (False, -1)
```
