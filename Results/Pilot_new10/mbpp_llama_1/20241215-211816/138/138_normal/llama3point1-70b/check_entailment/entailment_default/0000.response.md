Correctness: **True**

The code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). 

The code uses the `index` method of Python lists, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element. If the element is not found, a `ValueError` exception is raised, which is caught by the `except` block and handled by returning `(False, -1)`.

The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function handles the case where `element` is not in `array`, but does not explicitly handle cases where `array` is not a list or where `element` appears multiple times in `array`. However, in Python, the `index` method will work correctly even if `element` appears multiple times in `array`, because it always returns the index of the first occurrence. 

Additionally, the code will raise a `AttributeError` if `array` is not a list, because only lists have an `index` method. However, this is not necessarily an incorrect behavior, because the problem description does not specify what to do if `array` is not a list. If the problem description had specified that the function should handle non-list inputs, then the code would be incorrect. But since it does not, the code is correct as it is. 

Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
