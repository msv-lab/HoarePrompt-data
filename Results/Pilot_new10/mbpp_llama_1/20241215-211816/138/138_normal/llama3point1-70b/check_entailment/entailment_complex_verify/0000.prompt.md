You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return (True, index)
    except ValueError:
        return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

I have analyzed the given program and found that it correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The program uses the `index` method of the array to find the index of the element. If the element is found, the `index` method returns its index, and the function returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the element is not found, the `index` method raises a `ValueError` exception, which is caught by the `except` block, and the function returns a tuple with `False` and -1.

I have considered the following potential cases:

* The element is present in the array: In this case, the `index` method will return the correct index, and the function will return a tuple with `True` and the index.
* The element is not present in the array: In this case, the `index` method will raise a `ValueError` exception, which will be caught by the `except` block, and the function will return a tuple with `False` and -1.
* The array is empty: In this case, the `index` method will raise a `ValueError` exception, which will be caught by the `except` block, and the function will return a tuple with `False` and -1.

In all these cases, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of elements, and element is a value that can be compared with the elements in the array.
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return True, index
        #The program returns True and the index which is the position of element in array
    except (ValueError):
        return False, -1
        #The program returns False and -1
    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: array is a list of elements, and element is a value. If element is found in array, the function returns True and the index of element, otherwise, it returns False and -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `array` and a value `element`, and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is `True` if `element` is found in `array`, and `False` otherwise. The second element of the tuple is the index of `element` in `array` if it is found, or `-1` if not found. This function handles the case where `element` is not in `array` but does not explicitly handle cases where `array` is not a list or where `element` appears multiple times in `array`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
