Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct. It meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to return a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Here's why the program works correctly:

1. The function `func_1` iterates over the input array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and value of each element.
2. If the current element matches the target element, the function immediately returns a tuple containing `True` and the current index.
3. If the function completes the iteration without finding a match, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1, indicating that the element is not in the array.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including finding an element at different positions in the array and handling cases where the element is not found. 

After reviewing the program, I couldn't find any edge cases or potential inputs that would cause it to behave incorrectly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
