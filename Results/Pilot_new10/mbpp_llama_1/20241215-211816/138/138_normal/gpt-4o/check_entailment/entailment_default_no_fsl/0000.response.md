Correctness: **True**

The code does what the problem description says for every potential case. It correctly handles the case when the element is in the array and returns a tuple containing `True` and the index position of the element. It also correctly handles the case when the element is not in the array and returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

The function uses a simple iterative approach with `enumerate` to iterate over both the index and value of each element in the array. If it finds a match, it immediately returns the tuple. If it iterates over the entire array without finding a match, it returns the tuple indicating that the element was not found.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of the function's behavior. The hints also mention that the function covers cases for empty lists and lists with duplicate elements. The code indeed handles these cases correctly. 

For example, if the input array is empty, the function will return `(False, -1)` because the `for` loop will not execute and the function will return the default value. If the input array contains duplicate elements, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of the element. 

Overall, the code is correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
