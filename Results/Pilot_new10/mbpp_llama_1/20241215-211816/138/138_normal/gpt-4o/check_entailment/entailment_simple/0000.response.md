Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters: `arr` (a list) and `element` (any type of object that can be compared for equality).

2. It iterates through the list `arr` using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index and the value of each element in the list.

3. If it finds a match between the `element` and a value in the list, it immediately returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the matched element.

4. If it iterates through the entire list without finding a match, it returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`, indicating that the element is not in the list.

This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or `-1` if the element is not found).

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, as they demonstrate its behavior with different inputs and expected outputs. Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
