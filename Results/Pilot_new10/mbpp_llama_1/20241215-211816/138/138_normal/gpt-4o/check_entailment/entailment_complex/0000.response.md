Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The function iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which returns both the index and value of each element. This allows the function to keep track of the index of the element if it is found.
2. If the element is found, the function immediately returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. This meets the requirement of returning the index of the element if it exists in the array.
3. If the element is not found after iterating over the entire array, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and -1. This meets the requirement of returning `False` and -1 if the element does not exist in the array.
4. The function handles cases for empty lists and lists with duplicate elements correctly. If the list is empty, the function will not enter the loop and will return `False` and -1. If the list has duplicate elements, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of the element.

Overall, the program correctly implements the behavior described in the problem description, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
