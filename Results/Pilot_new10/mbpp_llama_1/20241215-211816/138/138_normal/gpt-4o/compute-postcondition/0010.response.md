The loop iterates over the list `arr` and checks if each element is equal to the given `element`. If a match is found, the function returns `True` along with the index of the matched element. 

If the loop completes all iterations without finding a match, the function implicitly returns `None` (since there's no explicit return statement after the loop). 

Given this behavior, we can deduce the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all, and since there's no explicit return statement in this case, the function will implicitly return `None`. The state of `index`, `value`, and `element` remains unchanged because the loop doesn't execute.
- If `arr` is not empty but no element matches `element`, the loop will iterate over the entire list without returning. Again, since there's no explicit return statement, the function will implicitly return `None`. The `index` and `value` will be those of the last element in `arr` because that's the last iteration of the loop.
- If an element in `arr` matches `element`, the function will return `True` along with the index of the matched element as soon as the match is found. This means `index` will be the index of the matched element, and `value` will be equal to `element`.

Considering these scenarios, the output state can be summarized as follows:

- If `arr` is empty, the function returns `None`, with `index`, `value`, and `element` retaining their original values (though `index` and `value` are not directly used outside the loop).
- If `arr` is not empty and no element matches `element`, the function returns `None`, with `index` being the last index of `arr`, `value` being the last element of `arr`, and `element` remains unchanged.
- If `arr` contains an element matching `element`, the function returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`, with `value` being equal to `element`.

However, to accurately capture the output state in a concise manner, focusing on the variables' relationships and values after all iterations have completed or been terminated:

Output State: **`arr` is a list, `element` is any type of object, if `arr` contains `element`, the function returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element`; otherwise, it implicitly returns `None`, with `index` and `value` reflecting the last element of `arr` if `arr` is not empty, or their original state if `arr` is empty.**
