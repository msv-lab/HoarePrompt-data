#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` remains the number of elements in `arr`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `size` is 1. If the original `arr` was empty, `arr` remains an empty list and `n` is 0. If the original `arr` had one element, `arr` and `n` remain unchanged.
    return arr
    #The program returns a list 'arr' that is sorted in descending order and has 'n' elements, if 'n' is 0 then 'arr' is an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of elements, sorts it in descending order using a variant of the pancake sort algorithm, and returns the sorted list. It correctly handles edge cases, including empty lists and lists containing a single element, returning them as is since they are already sorted.
