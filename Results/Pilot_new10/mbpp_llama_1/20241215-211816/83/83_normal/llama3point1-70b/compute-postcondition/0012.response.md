Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n-1`. If `max_index` is not 0, the elements in `arr` from index 0 to `max_index` are reversed, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the reversed part of `arr` excluding the last element of `arr`. If `max_index` is 0, the state of `arr`, `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remains unchanged.***
