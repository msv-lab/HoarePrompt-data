The given code `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the entire list `arr` since `size` is equal to `n`, which is the number of elements in `arr`. 

The condition regarding `max_index` does not affect the execution of this specific line of code. It seems to be part of a larger context or conditional statement not provided here. However, based on the given initial state and the code snippet, `arr` will be reversed regardless of the value of `max_index`.

After the reversal, `arr` is modified, but `n` and `size` remain unchanged because the number of elements in `arr` does not change when it is reversed. The value of `max_index` is also not directly affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is the reversed list of its original elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n`, and `max_index` retains its original value.

Output State: **`arr` is the reversed list of its original elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n`, and `max_index` retains its original value.**
