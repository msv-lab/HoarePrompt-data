Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n`. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are reversed and `max_index` is 0. If `max_index` is 0, no change occurs in `arr` and `max_index` remains 0.**
