The given Python code snippet reverses the elements in `arr` from the start up to `max_index` (inclusive).

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n-1`, the elements in `arr` from index 0 to `max_index` are reversed, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the reversed part of `arr` excluding the last element of `arr`.**
