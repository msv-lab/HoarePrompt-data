According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size` and `n`. If `size` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is equal to `n` and `n` is greater than 0, but since the loop iterates in reverse order, `size` must be decreased by 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `size` should be `n-1` for the next iteration, and since `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, `n` remains unchanged. 
State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n-1`**
