Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n`. The current value of `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`. The current value of `max_index` is not equal to the last index of `arr`, which is `size - 1`. Additionally, the current value of `max_index` is not equal to 0, meaning it is greater than 0.**
