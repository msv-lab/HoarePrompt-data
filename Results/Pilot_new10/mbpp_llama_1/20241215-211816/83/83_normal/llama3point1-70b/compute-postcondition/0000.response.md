The code `n = len(arr)` assigns the length of the list `arr` to the variable `n`. The length of a list in Python is the number of elements it contains. 

Given the initial state that `arr` is a list of elements, after executing the code, `n` will hold the number of elements in `arr`. The list `arr` itself remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr`**
