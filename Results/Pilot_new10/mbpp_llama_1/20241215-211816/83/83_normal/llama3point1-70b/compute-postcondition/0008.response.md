Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n`. If the index of the maximum element in `arr` is not the last index, then `arr` is the reversed list of its original elements, and the index of the maximum element `max_index` retains its original value. If the index of the maximum element in `arr` is the last index, then the state of `arr`, `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remains unchanged.***
