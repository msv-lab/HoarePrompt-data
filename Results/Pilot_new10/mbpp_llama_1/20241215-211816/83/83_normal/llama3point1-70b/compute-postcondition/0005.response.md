The given code reverses the elements in the list `arr` up to the index `max_index + 1` (inclusive). 

`arr[:max_index + 1]` selects all elements from the start of the list up to `max_index + 1`. 

`[::-1]` reverses the order of the selected elements.

The state of `n` is not affected as it is the total number of elements in `arr`, and the given code does not change the number of elements in `arr`, it only rearranges them.

Similarly, the state of `size` remains unchanged because `size` is equal to `n`, and `n` does not change.

The value of `max_index` is also not changed by the given code. However, since the elements up to `max_index + 1` are reversed, the index of the maximum element (which was at `max_index`) will now be at the beginning of the reversed segment, i.e., at index 0, considering the segment that was reversed. 

But we must remember that `max_index` is not equal to 0 initially and is not equal to the last index of `arr` initially. 

After the reversal, the maximum element will be at the beginning of the list, so `max_index` will become 0.

The rest of the list (from index `max_index + 1` to the end) remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list where the first `max_index + 1` elements are reversed, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n`, `max_index` is 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list where the first `max_index + 1` elements are reversed, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n`, `max_index` is 0**
