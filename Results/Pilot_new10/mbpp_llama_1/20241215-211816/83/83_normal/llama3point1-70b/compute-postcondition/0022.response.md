The program returns `arr` which is a list that is sorted in descending order. If the original `arr` was empty, `arr` remains an empty list. If the original `arr` had one element, `arr` remains unchanged. The number of elements in `arr` is defined by `n`. 
Output State: **The program returns a list 'arr' that is sorted in descending order and has 'n' elements, if 'n' is 0 then 'arr' is an empty list**
