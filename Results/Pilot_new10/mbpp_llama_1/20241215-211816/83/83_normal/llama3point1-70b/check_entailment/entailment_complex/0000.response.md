Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to sort a list of elements, but it does not specify the order of sorting. However, based on common understanding, sorting typically refers to ascending order. 

The provided program, on the other hand, sorts the list in descending order using a variant of the pancake sort algorithm. This means that for a list of elements, the program will return a sorted list, but it will be in descending order instead of the typical ascending order.

The reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that the problem description does not explicitly specify the order of sorting. However, since the program's intent is to sort a list of elements, and sorting is commonly understood to be in ascending order, the provided program does not meet the problem description's requirements.

To make the program correct according to the problem description, it should sort the list in ascending order. Here is an example of how the program could be modified to achieve this:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        min_index = arr.index(min(arr[:size]))
        
        if min_index!= size - 1:
            if min_index!= 0:
                arr[:min_index + 1] = arr[:min_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
        
    return arr
```

Alternatively, if the problem description is intended to be sorting in descending order, it should be explicitly specified. In that case, the provided program is correct. 

However, based on the current problem description and the provided program, the program does not meet the requirements.
