Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be ordered, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 3, `find_max_index` and `flip` are defined and accessible. If `max_index` is not equal to `curr_size - 1`, then `arr` is modified with elements up to the index `n - 3` flipped. Regardless of the condition, `curr_size` remains `n - 2`, and `max_index` remains the result of `find_max_index(n - 2)`.***
