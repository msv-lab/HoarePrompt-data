To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop statement:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of elements.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`.
- `max_index` is 0.

Now, considering the loop:
- The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `n-1` (since the upper bound in Python's `range()` function is exclusive).
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1, because if `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`).

Given these conditions:
- `arr` being a list of elements does not directly affect the loop's execution condition, but it's good to note that `n` is bounded by `len(arr)`.
- `n` needs to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute, as this ensures there is at least one iteration (when `i` equals 1).
- `max_index` being 0 does not directly influence the loop's ability to start executing, given the loop's structure. However, considering the context, `max_index` might be related to the loop body which is omitted, so we keep it as is for now.
- `i` will start at 1 for the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state adjustments are:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` starts at 1.

The adjusted state considering the original conditions and the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute is:
State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and such that `1 < n <= len(arr)`, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1**
