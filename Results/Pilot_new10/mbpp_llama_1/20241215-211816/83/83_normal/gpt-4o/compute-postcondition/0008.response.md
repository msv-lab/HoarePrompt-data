According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2 and `n` is less than or equal to the length of `arr`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3 and such that `3 < n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 3, if `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[max_index]`, then `max_index` is 3, otherwise `max_index` remains unchanged**
