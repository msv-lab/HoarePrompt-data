To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
    max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
    if max_index!= curr_size - 1:
        flip(max_index)
        flip(curr_size - 1)
```
From the output states, we can observe the following patterns:

* `curr_size` decreases by 1 in each iteration, starting from `n` and ending at 2 (since the loop range is `range(n, 1, -1)`).
* `max_index` is the result of `find_max_index(curr_size)`, which finds the index of the maximum element in the first `curr_size` elements of `arr`.
* If `max_index` is not equal to `curr_size - 1`, the elements at indices `max_index` and `curr_size - 1` are flipped using the `flip` function.

After all iterations have finished, the loop will have rearranged the elements in `arr` such that the maximum element in each subarray of size `curr_size` is at the end of that subarray.

Since `curr_size` decreases from `n` to 2, the loop will have sorted the entire array `arr` in descending order.

The final value of `curr_size` will be 2, since the loop range ends at 2.

The final value of `max_index` will be the result of `find_max_index(2)`, which finds the index of the maximum element in the first 2 elements of `arr`.

The output state after all iterations have finished will be:

* `arr` is a list of elements that can be ordered, sorted in descending order.
* `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, which remains unchanged throughout the loop.
* `find_max_index` and `flip` are defined and accessible, since they are used throughout the loop.
* `curr_size` is 2, which is the final value of the loop variable.
* `max_index` is the result of `find_max_index(2)`, which finds the index of the maximum element in the first 2 elements of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements in descending order, `n` is the original number of elements in `arr`, `find_max_index` and `flip` are defined and accessible, `curr_size` is 2**
