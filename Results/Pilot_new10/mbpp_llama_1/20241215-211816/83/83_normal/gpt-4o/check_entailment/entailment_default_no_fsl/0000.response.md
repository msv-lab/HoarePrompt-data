Correctness: **False**

The given code attempts to implement a sorting algorithm using the `func_1`, `flip`, and `find_max_index` functions. However, the implementation has several issues that make it incorrect for every potential case.

One major issue is that the `func_1` function does not correctly implement the sorting algorithm. It uses the `find_max_index` function to find the index of the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the last element of the unsorted part using the `flip` function. However, this approach does not guarantee a sorted list, especially when there are duplicate elements or when the input list is not already partially sorted.

Another issue is that the `find_max_index` function does not handle the case where the input `n` is 0. In this scenario, the function will return 0 without performing any comparisons, which is not the expected behavior.

Additionally, the `flip` function modifies the original list by reversing the elements from the start of the list to the index specified by the `end` parameter, but it does not return anything. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the function is used in a context where the returned value is expected to be used.

The problem description asks for a function to sort a list of elements, but the provided code does not meet this requirement for every potential case. For example, if the input list is `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]`, the `func_1` function will not produce the correct sorted list `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]`.

Therefore, the Correctness is **False** because the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
