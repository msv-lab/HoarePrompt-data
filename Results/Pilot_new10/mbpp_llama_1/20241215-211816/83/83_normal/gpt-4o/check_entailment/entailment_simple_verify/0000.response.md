The original assessment of the program's correctness is **False**, and the annotated version of the code does not change this assessment. The main issues with the program are:

1. The `arr` variable is used in multiple functions, but it is not defined as a global variable or passed as an argument to the functions. Although the annotated version of the code provides a state where `arr` is accessible within the scope of the functions, the original code snippet does not show `arr` being passed to the functions `flip` and `find_max_index`. 

2. The `find_max_index` function is called with an argument `curr_size`, but the original code does not use this argument correctly inside the function. The function should find the index of the maximum element in the subarray from index 0 to `curr_size - 1`, but the provided implementation does not consider the `curr_size` argument and instead uses `n` which is not defined in the function.

3. The `func_1` function does not correctly implement the pancake sort algorithm. The algorithm should repeatedly find the maximum unsorted element and flip it to the end of the unsorted portion of the array, but the provided implementation does not correctly implement this step. The annotated version of the code shows that `func_1` returns a list in descending order, but the problem description asks for a sorted list in ascending order.

The annotated version of the code does provide some information about the state of the program at different points, but it does not address the issues mentioned above. The annotations seem to be describing a correct implementation of the pancake sort algorithm, but the original code does not match this description.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is still **False**.

Final: **False**
