Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it sorts the list in descending order instead of ascending order. The problem description asks for a function to sort a list of elements, without specifying any particular order, but the given unit tests suggest that the expected result is a sorted list in ascending order.

In the function `func_1`, the code uses a max heap approach to sort the list, but it does not reverse the list at the end to obtain the sorted list in ascending order. As a result, the function returns a list that is sorted in descending order, which does not meet the expected result.

For example, given the input `[15, 79, 25, 38, 69]`, the function will return `[79, 69, 38, 25, 15]` instead of the expected `[15, 25, 38, 69, 79]`.

To fix this, the function should reverse the list after the sorting process to obtain the sorted list in ascending order. Alternatively, the function could be modified to use a min heap approach, which would naturally produce the sorted list in ascending order.

Here's how you could modify `func_1` to sort in ascending order:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        min_index = find_min_index(curr_size)
        
        if min_index!= curr_size - 1:
            flip(min_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    return arr

def find_min_index(n):
    min_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] < arr[min_index]:
            min_index = i
        
    return min_index
```
In this modified version, I replaced `find_max_index` with `find_min_index`, which finds the index of the minimum element in the subarray `arr[0:n]`. This change results in a sorted list in ascending order. 

However, please note that this program uses an inefficient sorting algorithm (a variation of selection sort) with a time complexity of O(n^2). For larger inputs, more efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort should be used. 

Also note that Python has a built-in sorting function `sorted()` which can be used to sort lists in ascending or descending order. 

```python
arr = [15, 79, 25, 38, 69]
arr_sorted = sorted(arr)
print(arr_sorted)  # prints: [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
```
