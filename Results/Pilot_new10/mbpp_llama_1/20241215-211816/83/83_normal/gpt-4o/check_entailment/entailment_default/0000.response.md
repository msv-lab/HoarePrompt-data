Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided code attempts to sort a list of elements, but upon closer inspection, it has several issues. 

1. **Undefined Variables and Functions**: The function `func_1` calls `find_max_index` and `flip`, but these functions are defined separately and do not seem to be part of a class or the same scope where `arr` is defined. This is problematic because `find_max_index` and `flip` reference `arr`, which is not passed to them as a parameter. It seems like these functions should either be methods of a class that contains `arr` or `arr` should be passed to them as a parameter.

2. **Incorrect Sorting Algorithm**: The function `func_1` seems to be an attempt to implement a sorting algorithm, possibly a variation of pancake sort, given the `flip` function. However, the implementation is flawed. The sorting algorithm described in the code does not actually sort the list in ascending order as required by the problem description. It appears to be trying to sort the list in descending order based on the description in the output hints for `func_1`, but even this is not correctly implemented due to the issues with the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions.

3. **Missing Logic in `find_max_index`**: The function `find_max_index` does not handle the case when `n` is 0 correctly. In such a scenario, the function will return 0 without any comparison, which might not be the intended behavior if the list is empty or if `n` equals 0.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The functions do not correctly handle edge cases such as empty lists, lists with a single element, or lists with duplicate elements. For example, if the input list is already sorted, the function should ideally return the list as it is, but due to its implementation, it might not behave correctly.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly sort a list of elements as described in the problem. It has logical errors, undefined variables, and incorrect handling of edge cases, leading to the conclusion that the code is not correct for every potential case.
