Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly implement a sorting function for a list of elements. 

The main issue with the program is that it uses a global variable `arr` in the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions, but this variable is not defined in these functions. The `arr` variable is defined in the `func_1` function and should be passed as a parameter to the other functions.

Another issue is that the `flip` function does not correctly reverse the array up to the `end` index. It only swaps elements from the start to the `end` index, but it does not check if `start` and `end` indices are within the bounds of the array.

Additionally, the `func_1` function does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm. It appears to be attempting to implement a pancake sort algorithm, but it does not correctly identify the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the array and move it to the end of the unsorted portion.

Here is an example of an input where the program does not work correctly: `arr = [3, 2, 1]`. The program will throw an error because the `arr` variable is not defined in the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions.

To correct this program, we would need to modify the `func_1`, `find_max_index`, and `flip` functions to correctly implement a sorting algorithm and pass the `arr` variable as a parameter to the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions. Here is an example of how the corrected code might look:

```python
def pancake_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(arr, curr_size)
        if max_index!= curr_size - 1:
            flip(arr, max_index)
            flip(arr, curr_size - 1)
    return arr

def flip(arr, end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        start += 1
        end -= 1

def find_max_index(arr, n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index

print(pancake_sort([3, 2, 1]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```
