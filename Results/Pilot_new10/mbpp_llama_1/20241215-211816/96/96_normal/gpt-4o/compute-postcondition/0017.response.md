The function func_1 accepts a tuple `tup` as input. Upon analyzing the code line by line, it is evident that the function checks if all elements in the tuple are of the same type as the first element. 

Here are the key observations:
1. If the tuple is empty, the function immediately returns `True`.
2. If the tuple is not empty, it iterates through each element and checks if its type matches the type of the first element (`first_type`). If a mismatch is found, it returns `False`.
3. If the loop completes without finding any type mismatches, the function returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the tuple are of the same type as the first element.

The code does not explicitly handle cases where the tuple contains unhashable types or nested structures, but based on the given code, these cases are implicitly handled by the type comparison. The function does not return any value other than a boolean (`True` or `False`).

Therefore, considering all potential cases and the actual code, the functionality of the function is to check if a given tuple is empty or if all its elements are of the same type as the first element, returning `True` in the former case or if the types match, and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple and returns True if the tuple is empty or if all its elements are of the same type as the first element, and False otherwise. **
