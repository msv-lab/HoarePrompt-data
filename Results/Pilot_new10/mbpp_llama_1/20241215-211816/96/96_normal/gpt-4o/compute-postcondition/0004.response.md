To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `tup` is a non-empty tuple.
- `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`.

Loop statement:
```python
for element in tup:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For this loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `tup` must be iterable, which it is since it's a tuple.
2. `tup` must not be empty, which aligns with the given condition that `tup` is a non-empty tuple.
3. The loop will iterate over each element in `tup`. Thus, at the start of the loop, `element` will be the first element of `tup`, which is `tup[0]`.

Adjustments to the state:
- `tup` is already stated to be a non-empty tuple, so no adjustment is needed here.
- `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, which means `element` at the start of the loop will be of type `first_type`.
- Since `tup` is not empty, the loop will execute at least once, with `element` taking the value of the first item in `tup`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple, `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, `element` is `tup[0]` and is of type `first_type`**
