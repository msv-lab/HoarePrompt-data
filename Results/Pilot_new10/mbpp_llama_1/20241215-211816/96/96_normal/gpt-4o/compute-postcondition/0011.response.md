According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tup`. If `tup` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` has at least two elements, `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, `element` is `tup[1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tup` must have at least 3 elements and `element` must be `tup[2]`. 
State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least three elements, `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, `element` is `tup[2]`**
