Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type or not.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

* The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input.
* If the tuple is empty, it returns `True` immediately. This is consistent with the problem description, as an empty tuple can be considered to have all elements of the same data type (vacuously true).
* If the tuple is not empty, it checks the type of the first element `tup[0]` and stores it in `first_type`.
* Then, it iterates through the rest of the elements in the tuple. If it finds any element whose type differs from `first_type`, it immediately returns `False`.
* If the function finishes checking all elements without finding any type mismatches, it returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the tuple are of the same type as the first element.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* Empty tuple: returns `True`
* Tuple with all elements of the same type: returns `True`
* Tuple with elements of different types: returns `False`

The provided unit tests `assert` statements also demonstrate the correctness of the function.

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and its behavior is consistent with the expected outcome for all possible input cases.
