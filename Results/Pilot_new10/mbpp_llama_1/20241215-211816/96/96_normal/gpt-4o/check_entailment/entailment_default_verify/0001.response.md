To assess the correctness of the program, let's break it down:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type or not.
2. **Provided Code**: The function `func_1` iterates over the tuple, comparing the type of each element to the type of the first element (`first_type`). If it finds an element with a different type, it immediately returns `False`. If the function iterates over the entire tuple without finding any elements of a different type, or if the tuple is empty, it returns `True`.
3. **Original Assessment**: None, meaning we have no prior judgment on the program's correctness.
4. **Output Hints**: These indicate that the function behaves as follows: It returns `True` if the tuple is empty or if all elements are of the same type as the first element, and `False` otherwise.

Given the problem description and the code provided, the code seems to implement the described behavior correctly. The key consideration is whether the code accurately checks if all elements in a tuple are of the same data type. 

- **Empty Tuple Handling**: The code correctly handles the case of an empty tuple by returning `True`, as there are no elements to compare.
  
- **Single-Type Tuple Handling**: For tuples where all elements are of the same type, the code correctly returns `True`.

- **Multi-Type Tuple Handling**: If the tuple contains elements of different types, the code correctly identifies the discrepancy and returns `False`.

The output hints align with the code's behavior and the problem description. The hints specify that the function returns `True` for an empty tuple or a tuple where all elements are of the same type as the first element, and `False` otherwise, which matches the provided code's logic.

Considering these points, the original lack of assessment (i.e., "None") implies a need for evaluation. Upon evaluation, it appears the code correctly implements the required functionality based on the problem description and the output hints.

**Final: True**
