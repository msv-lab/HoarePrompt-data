You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

def func_1(tup):
    if not tup:
        return True
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

I believe the code is correct because it checks the type of each element in the tuple and returns False as soon as it finds an element with a different type. If the tuple is empty, it returns True because there are no elements to check. 

The code handles all potential cases, including:

- An empty tuple: It correctly returns True.
- A tuple with only one element: It correctly returns True.
- A tuple with multiple elements of the same type: It correctly returns True.
- A tuple with multiple elements of different types: It correctly returns False.

The code uses a simple and efficient approach to check the types of all elements in the tuple. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the tuple, because it checks each element once. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the type of the first element.

I couldn't think of any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    if (not tup) :
        return True
        #The program returns boolean value True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: tup is a tuple, and tup is not empty
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` is a non-empty tuple, `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, and all elements in `tup` are of type `first_type`, or the function returns False if any element's type differs from `first_type`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating all elements in 'tup' are of the same type as 'tup[0]'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
