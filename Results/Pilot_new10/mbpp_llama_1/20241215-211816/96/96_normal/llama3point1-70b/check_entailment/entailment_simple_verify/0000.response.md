The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(tup)` correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It uses a set comprehension to generate a set of the types of all elements in the tuple, and then checks if the length of this set is 1. If it is, that means all elements have the same type, because a set in Python cannot contain duplicate values. 

The annotated version of the code confirms this assessment, as it includes the state of the program before the function call (where tup is a tuple) and a comment after the return statement explaining the expected output of the function.

The function correctly handles tuples of any size and identifies tuples where all elements are of the same type or where elements have different types. 

Since the function handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement without any exceptions or incorrect results, it is considered correct.

Final: **True**
