Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I believe the program is correct. The original assessment is accurate, and the annotated version of the code confirms this assessment.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1(tup)` uses a set comprehension to generate a set of the types of all elements in the tuple and checks if the length of this set is 1. This correctly handles tuples of any size, including empty tuples, and identifies tuples where all elements are of the same type or have different types.

The annotated version of the code also confirms this assessment, as it describes the state of the program and the expected output correctly. The annotation "#The program returns True if all elements in tuple 'tup' are of the same type, False otherwise" matches the original assessment's explanation.

Therefore, I believe the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code.

Final: **True**
