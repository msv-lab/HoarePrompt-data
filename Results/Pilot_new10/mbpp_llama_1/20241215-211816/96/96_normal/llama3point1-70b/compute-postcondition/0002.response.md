The function func_1 accepts a tuple parameter tup. According to the code, it checks if all elements in the tuple are of the same type by converting each element's type to a set and comparing the length of this set to 1. If the length is 1, it means all elements have the same type, and the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This functionality covers all potential cases, including empty tuples (where the function would return True since the set of types would be empty, thus having a length of 0, but this case is not explicitly handled differently), tuples with a single element (where the function would correctly return True), and tuples with multiple elements of the same or different types.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns `True` if all elements in `tup` are of the same type, `False` otherwise, handling tuples of any size and type composition. **
