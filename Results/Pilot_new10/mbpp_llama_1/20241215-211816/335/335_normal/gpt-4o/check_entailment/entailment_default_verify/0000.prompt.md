You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` appears to be correct based on the problem description. It finds the first occurrence of the substring within the main string and returns a tuple containing the substring, its start position, and end position. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`.

The function uses the `find` method of the string class to get the start position of the substring. If `find` returns `-1`, it means the substring is not found, so the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the end position by adding the length of the substring to the start position.

All the provided unit tests seem to work correctly with this function. It correctly identifies the start and end positions of the substrings in the main string and returns `None` when the substring is not found.

The function handles the edge cases well, such as when the substring is at the beginning or end of the main string, and when the substring is not found. It does not have any apparent issues with handling different types of input, such as empty strings or substrings.

Overall, the function seems to meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and no potential cases could be found where it does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two strings, `main_string` and `sub_string`, and returns `None` if `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`; otherwise, it returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, its starting position, and its ending position in `main_string`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
