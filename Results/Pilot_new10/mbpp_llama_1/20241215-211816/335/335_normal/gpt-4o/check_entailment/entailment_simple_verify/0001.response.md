The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**. The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the occurrence and position of a given substring within a main string. The function returns a tuple containing the matched substring, its start position, and its end position. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

The function uses the built-in `find` method of Python strings, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value. If the specified value is not found, it returns `-1`. 

The function correctly calculates the end position of the substring by adding the length of the substring to its start position.

The annotated version of the code also confirms this. The state of the program before the function call is as expected, with `main_string` and `sub_string` being strings. After the if block has been executed, `start_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string` and is not equal to -1, meaning `sub_string` is found in `main_string`. The program then correctly returns the substring, start position, and end position.

All the provided unit tests also pass, and the function behaves as expected for different inputs, including cases where the substring is not found.

The only potential issue is that the function does not perform any error checking on its inputs, but based on the problem description, this is not a requirement.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
