The original assessment was "None", which implies that it was not provided. However, after examining the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I believe that the program is correct.

The program correctly implements a function to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. The `find` method is used to get the starting position of the substring, and the ending position is calculated by adding the length of the substring to the starting position. If the substring is not found, the function returns `None`.

The annotated version of the code confirms this analysis, as it correctly describes the state of the program at different points. The program returns `None` when the substring is not found, and it returns the correct substring, starting position, and ending position when the substring is found.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
