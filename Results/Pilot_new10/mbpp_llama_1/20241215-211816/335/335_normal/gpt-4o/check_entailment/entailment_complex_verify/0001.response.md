The original assessment and the annotated version of the code both describe the function's behavior accurately. The function correctly finds the first occurrence of a substring within a main string and returns its start and end positions. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`. 

The original assessment correctly points out that the function does not perform error checking on the inputs, but this is explicitly stated as not being a requirement since we assume the input will always be valid.

The annotated version of the code clearly describes the state of the program at different points and provides a step-by-step explanation of how the function works.

Given that the function behaves as expected and correctly handles the provided test cases, and assuming that the input will always be valid, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
