To determine the correctness of the program, we'll analyze the problem description, the original assessment, the provided code, and the annotated version.

The problem description requires a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and return None if there is no match.

The original assessment is None, which means no assessment was provided.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a main string and a sub-string as input, uses the `find` method to get the start position of the sub-string, and returns a tuple containing the sub-string, its start position, and its end position. If the sub-string is not found, the function returns None.

The annotated code provides additional information about the state of the program at different points, which is consistent with the problem description and the provided code.

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program seems to be correct. It correctly finds the first occurrence of the sub-string in the main string and returns its start and end positions. If the sub-string is not found, it returns None.

The original assessment is None, which means no opinion was expressed about the program's correctness. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Therefore, the final assessment is that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
