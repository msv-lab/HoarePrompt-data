The original assessment seems accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version of the code confirms the original assessment's explanation of the program's behavior.

The function `func_1` correctly finds the first occurrence of the substring within the main string using the `find` method. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the end position of the substring by adding its length to the start position and returns a tuple containing the substring, its start position, and end position.

The annotated version of the code indicates that the function handles the edge cases as expected. For example, when the substring is found, it correctly calculates the start and end positions and returns the expected result. When the substring is not found, it returns `None`.

The provided unit tests also support the original assessment, as they demonstrate the function's correct behavior in different scenarios.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains the same.

Final: **True**
