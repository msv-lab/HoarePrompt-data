Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the occurrence and position of a given substring within a main string. The function returns a tuple containing the matched substring, its start position, and its end position. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

The function uses the built-in `find` method of Python strings, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value. If the specified value is not found, it returns `-1`. 

The function correctly calculates the end position of the substring by adding the length of the substring to its start position.

All the provided unit tests pass, and the function behaves as expected for different inputs, including cases where the substring is not found. 

There are no obvious edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. It correctly handles cases where the substring is at the beginning or end of the main string, and it correctly handles cases where the substring is not found.

The function does not perform any error checking on its inputs. For example, it assumes that both the main string and the substring are actually strings, and it does not check for this. However, based on the problem description, it seems that this is not a requirement.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and works as expected for all the provided test cases. It correctly finds the occurrence and position of substrings within a given string and returns `None` if no match is found.
