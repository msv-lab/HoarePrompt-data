Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the problem description. It finds the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string, returning `None` if there is no match. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code seems to be correct for every potential case:

- It uses the `find` method to get the starting position of the substring in the main string.
- If the substring is not found (`start_pos == -1`), it correctly returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, it calculates the ending position by adding the length of the substring to the starting position and returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position.

The provided unit tests and output hints demonstrate the function's behavior in various scenarios, including finding a substring at different positions and returning `None` when the substring is not present. The function handles these cases as expected according to the problem description. 

Without additional counterexamples or edge cases that the function fails to handle, based on the provided information, it appears to fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.
