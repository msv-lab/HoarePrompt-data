Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program checks if the substring exists in the main string using the `find()` method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is not found, `find()` returns -1.

2. If the substring is not found (i.e., `start_pos` is -1), the program returns `None`, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

3. If the substring is found, the program calculates the end position of the substring by adding the length of the substring to the start position.

4. Finally, the program returns a tuple containing the substring, the start position, and the end position, which meets the problem description's requirement to return the occurrence and position of the substring.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the program behaves correctly in different scenarios, such as when the substring is found at the beginning, middle, or end of the main string, and when the substring is not found at all. 

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
