To determine the final correctness of the program, we need to assess whether it accurately implements the described functionality. The problem asks for a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string, returning None if there is no match. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a `main_string` and a `sub_string` as input and returns either None (if `sub_string` is not found) or a tuple containing `sub_string`, its start position, and its end position within `main_string`.

The original assessment is None, indicating a lack of evaluation or conclusions drawn about the program's correctness. 

Given the output hints, we understand that the function's expected behavior is to return None if `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, and otherwise, return a tuple with the `sub_string`, its start position, and its end position. The provided code seems to correctly implement this functionality:
- It uses the `find` method to locate the `sub_string` within `main_string`, which returns -1 if `sub_string` is not found.
- If `sub_string` is found, it calculates the end position by adding the length of `sub_string` to the start position.
- The function then returns a tuple with `sub_string`, its start position, and its calculated end position, or None if `sub_string` is not found.

Considering the problem description and the output hints, the provided code seems to accurately implement the required functionality. There is no indication that the original assessment, which is None, was incorrect based on the code's behavior and the expected output as described by the output hints.

However, the reason the original assessment was None, and thus not directly addressing the correctness of the code, is understandable because without evaluating the code against the problem description and output hints, one cannot conclusively determine its correctness.

Given all the information:
- The code seems to implement the required functionality correctly according to the problem description.
- The output hints match the observed behavior of the code.
- There are no obvious cases where the code would not behave as expected given valid inputs.

Thus, based on the information provided and following the required format:

Final: **True**
