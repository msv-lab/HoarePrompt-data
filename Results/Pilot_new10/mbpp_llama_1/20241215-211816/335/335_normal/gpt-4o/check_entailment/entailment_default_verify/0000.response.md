Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The code correctly implements a function that finds the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, and otherwise, it returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position in the main string.

The output hints provided align with the code's functionality, and the unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness. There is no apparent contradiction between the problem description, the code, and the output hints. The function appears to handle edge cases correctly, such as when the substring is at the beginning or end of the main string, and when the substring is not found.

Therefore, the original assessment's conclusion of **True** seems accurate. The code meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and no potential cases could be found where it does not work as expected.

Final: **True**
