Based on the provided problem description, code, original assessment, and output hints, the program appears to be correct. It correctly identifies the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string, and it returns `None` if no match is found.

The original assessment is accurate because the function works as expected for all the provided test cases. It correctly handles cases where the substring is at the beginning or end of the main string, and it correctly handles cases where the substring is not found. The output hints provided also match the expected functionality of the program.

The program assumes that the inputs are valid, and it does not perform any error checking. However, this is acceptable based on the problem description and the assumption that the user will always provide valid input.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True** 

The reason for maintaining the original assessment is that the program works correctly for all the provided test cases, and the output hints match the expected functionality of the program. The program correctly finds the occurrence and position of substrings within a given string and returns `None` if no match is found, as required by the problem description.
