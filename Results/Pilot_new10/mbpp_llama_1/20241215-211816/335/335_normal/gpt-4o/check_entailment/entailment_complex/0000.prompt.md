You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_string and sub_string are strings.
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if (start_pos == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a string, `start_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string` and `start_pos` is not equal to -1, meaning `sub_string` is found in `main_string`
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return sub_string, start_pos, end_pos
    #The program returns a string 'sub_string', an integer 'start_pos' that is the index of the first occurrence of 'sub_string' in 'main_string', and an integer 'end_pos' that is 'start_pos' plus the length of 'sub_string'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two strings, `main_string` and `sub_string`, and returns `None` if `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`; otherwise, it returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, its starting position, and its ending position in `main_string`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
