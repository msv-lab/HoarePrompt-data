The original assessment states that the correctness of the function is **True**. After analyzing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

The function `func_1` correctly finds the first occurrence of the substring within the main string and returns a tuple containing the substring, its start position, and end position. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`. The function handles different edge cases well, such as when the substring is at the beginning or end of the main string.

The annotated version of the code provides a clear understanding of the state of the program at different points, and it does not reveal any potential errors or inaccuracies. The function's behavior is consistent with the problem description, and all the provided unit tests seem to work correctly.

Therefore, I do not see any reason to change the original assessment. The function appears to meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and no potential cases could be found where it does not work as expected.

Final: **True**
