You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the occurrence and position of a given substring within a main string. The function returns a tuple containing the matched substring, its start position, and its end position. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

The function uses the built-in `find` method of Python strings, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value. If the specified value is not found, it returns `-1`. 

The function correctly calculates the end position of the substring by adding the length of the substring to its start position.

All the provided unit tests pass, and the function behaves as expected for different inputs, including cases where the substring is not found. 

There are no obvious edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. It correctly handles cases where the substring is at the beginning or end of the main string, and it correctly handles cases where the substring is not found.

The function does not perform any error checking on its inputs. For example, it assumes that both the main string and the substring are actually strings, and it does not check for this. However, based on the problem description, it seems that this is not a requirement.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and works as expected for all the provided test cases. It correctly finds the occurrence and position of substrings within a given string and returns `None` if no match is found.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two strings, `main_string` and `sub_string`, and returns `None` if `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`; otherwise, it returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, its starting position, and its ending position in `main_string`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
