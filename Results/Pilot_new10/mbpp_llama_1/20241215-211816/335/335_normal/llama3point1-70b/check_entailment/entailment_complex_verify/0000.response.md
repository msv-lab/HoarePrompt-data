The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version of the code confirms the states of the program at different points and matches the expectation described in the original assessment.

The function correctly identifies the start and end indices of the substring when it is found and returns `None` if the substring is not found in the string. The annotations provided also describe the expected behavior of the function, including the handling of edge cases such as empty strings.

The reason the original assessment is accurate is that it considers the core requirement of finding the occurrence and position of the substring within the string. It also correctly notes the function's behavior in cases where the substring is not found or when it is found at the beginning or middle of the string.

One potential point of contention could be the lack of input validation in the function, which the annotated code mentions. However, since the problem statement and the original assessment assume that the inputs are valid (i.e., strings), this does not affect the correctness of the function within the scope of the problem description.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the original assessment is accurate, and the function behaves as intended according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
