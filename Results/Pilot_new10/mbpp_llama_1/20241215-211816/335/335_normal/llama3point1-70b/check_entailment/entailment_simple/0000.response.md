Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `string` and `substring`. It uses the `find` method to get the starting index of the `substring` in the `string`.
2. If the `substring` is not found in the `string`, `find` returns -1, and the function returns `None`, as specified in the problem description.
3. If the `substring` is found, the function calculates the ending index of the `substring` by adding the length of the `substring` to the starting index.
4. The function then returns a tuple containing the `substring`, the starting index, and the ending index (which is the index of the last character of the `substring`).

The program handles all potential cases:

* If the `substring` is not present in the `string`, it returns `None`.
* If the `substring` is present in the `string`, it returns the `substring`, its starting index, and its ending index.

The program's logic is correct, and it adheres to the problem description. It does not have any obvious bugs or edge cases that would cause it to deviate from the specified behavior. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
