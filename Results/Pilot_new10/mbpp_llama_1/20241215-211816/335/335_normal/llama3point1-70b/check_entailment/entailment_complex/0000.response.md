Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Handling Non-Matches**: If the substring is not found in the string, the `find` method returns -1, and the function correctly returns `None` as per the problem description.

2. **Handling Matches**: If the substring is found, the function returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting index in the string, and the index of its last character. This aligns with the problem description's requirement to return the occurrence and position of the substring.

3. **Calculating End Index**: The end index of the substring is calculated as `start + len(substring) - 1`, which correctly identifies the last character's position of the substring in the string.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although the function does not explicitly handle edge cases like empty strings or non-string inputs, its behavior in these scenarios is consistent with the annotations provided:
   - For an empty substring in a non-empty string, `find` returns 0, indicating the start of the string, and the function would return a tuple with an empty string, start index 0, and end index -1, which is a reasonable interpretation of finding an empty substring at the start of the string.
   - For both inputs being empty strings, the function would return a tuple with an empty string, start index 0, and end index -1, which again is a plausible outcome given the substring is technically found at the start of the string.

The program does not include explicit input validation for non-string parameters, but given the problem description focuses on string inputs and the function's behavior, this lack of validation does not inherently make the function incorrect based on the description provided. The function behaves as intended for the scenarios outlined in the problem description, making it correct within the context given.
