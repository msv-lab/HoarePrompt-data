The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version of the code does not reveal any contradictions to the original assessment. 

Here is why the original assessment seems correct:
- The function `func_1` does indeed find the occurrence and position of the first substring within the given string.
- It correctly returns `None` if the substring is not found, fulfills the first condition of the problem description.
- When the substring is found, it accurately calculates the start and end indices, fulfilling the second condition of the problem description.
- The end index calculation `end - 1` is also correct because Python uses zero-based indexing and the end index in Python's string slicing is exclusive, meaning the end index points to the character after the last character of the substring.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a minor discrepancy in the return statement of the provided function and its description. The function is supposed to return a tuple containing the substring, the starting index, and the ending index of the substring. However, in the return statement, it is written as `return substring, start, end - 1` instead of `return (substring, start, end - 1)`. Although in Python, the parentheses around the tuple are optional, and the comma already implies a tuple, it might be more readable and clear to include the parentheses.

But for the given problem description and the provided code, this minor point does not seem to be the main focus, and the original assessment seems to capture the essence of the function's correctness in terms of finding the substring and its indices.

Final: **True**
