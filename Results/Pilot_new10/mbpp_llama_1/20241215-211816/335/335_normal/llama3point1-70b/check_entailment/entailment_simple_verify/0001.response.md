The original assessment states that the program is correct, and the provided code and annotations support this claim. The program correctly uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring within the string. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`. If the substring is found, it calculates the end position of the match and returns a tuple containing the matched substring, its start position, and its end position.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program behaves as expected at different points. Before the function call, `string` and `substring` are strings. After the `if` block, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and `start` is not equal to -1, meaning `substring` is found in `string`. The program then correctly calculates the end position of the match and returns the expected values.

The original assessment also considers various cases, including when the substring is found at the beginning, middle, or end of the string, and when it is not found. The annotations do not reveal any issues with these cases.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the string and returns `None` if there is no match.

Final: **True**
