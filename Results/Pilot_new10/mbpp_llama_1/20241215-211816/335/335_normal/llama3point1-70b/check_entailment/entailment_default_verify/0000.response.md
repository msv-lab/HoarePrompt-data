The original assessment was "None", implying that it was inconclusive or not provided. However, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, we can conclude that the program is correct.

The code implements a function that finds the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`. The output hints confirm this behavior, providing examples of how the function handles different cases, such as an empty substring or an empty string.

The output hints also mention that the function assumes inputs are strings and does not perform input validation. While this might lead to unexpected behavior with non-string inputs, the problem description does not explicitly require input validation. Since we assume the user will always provide valid input, the lack of input validation does not affect the program's correctness.

The function handles edge cases correctly, such as an empty substring in a non-empty string, and a tuple with an empty string, start index 0, and end index -1 if both inputs are empty strings.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, the program is correct, and the original assessment was not accurate because it was inconclusive.

Final: **True**
