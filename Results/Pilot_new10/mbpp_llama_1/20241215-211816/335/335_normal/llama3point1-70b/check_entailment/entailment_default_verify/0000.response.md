The original assessment concludes that the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided code. The code effectively finds the occurrence and position of the first substring within the given string. It uses the built-in `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring and returns `None` if the substring is not found. When the substring is found, it correctly calculates the end index by adding the length of the substring to the start index and subtracts 1 to point to the last character of the matched substring.

The output hints support the original assessment by confirming the function's behavior for different cases, including when the substring is found, not found, or when dealing with empty strings. The hints also acknowledge the lack of input validation, which is not a concern given the assumption that inputs will be valid.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement for all potential cases, assuming valid inputs.

Final: **True**
