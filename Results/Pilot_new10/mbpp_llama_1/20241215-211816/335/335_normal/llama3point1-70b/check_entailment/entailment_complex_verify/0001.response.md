The original assessment seems to be mostly accurate, but it doesn't account for a specific case that may cause the program to behave unexpectedly. The annotated version of the code describes the states of the program correctly and provides additional insight into the program's behavior.

However, upon reviewing the annotated code, it's clear that the program returns the correct information when the substring is found in the string. The issue that might arise is when the program handles empty strings or non-string inputs, but as per the problem description, it's assumed that the input will be valid.

One potential issue with the program is that it returns `end - 1` as the end index of the substring. This is because the end index in Python is exclusive, meaning it's the index after the last character of the substring. So, if the substring is "abc" and it starts at index 0, the end index will be 2, not 3.

Despite this, the program still meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and return `None` if there is no match.

The original assessment is mostly accurate, but it's worth noting that the program doesn't handle all edge cases explicitly, such as non-string inputs or empty strings. However, as per the problem description, it's assumed that the input will be valid.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
