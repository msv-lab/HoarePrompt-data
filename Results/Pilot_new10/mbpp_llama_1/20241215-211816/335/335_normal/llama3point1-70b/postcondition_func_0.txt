The function accepts two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns `None` if `substring` is not found in `string`. If `substring` is found, it returns a tuple containing the `substring`, its starting index in `string`, and the index of its last character in `string`. The function assumes inputs are strings and does not perform input validation, which may lead to unexpected behavior with non-string inputs. It handles empty strings by returning `None` for an empty `substring` in a non-empty `string`, and a tuple with an empty string, start index 0, and end index -1 if both inputs are empty strings.
