The code assigns the value of `start + len(substring)` to the variable `end`. Since `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` and is not equal to -1, `substring` is found in `string`. 

The length of `substring` is added to `start` to calculate `end`, which effectively gives the index after the occurrence of `substring` in `string`.

Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, `end` is `start + len(substring)`, and `substring` is found in `string`**
