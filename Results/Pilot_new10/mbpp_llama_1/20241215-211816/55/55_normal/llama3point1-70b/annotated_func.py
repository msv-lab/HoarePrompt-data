#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_case_str is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where each word is separated by a single underscore.
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)
    return camel_case_str
    #To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the code's impact:
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, with each word separated by a single underscore.
    #   - `words` is a list of strings where each string is a word from `snake_case_str`. This implies that `words` has been split from `snake_case_str` based on the underscore.
    #   - `camel_case_str` is a string created by joining each word in `words` (which are first capitalized) without any separator.
    #
    #2. **Code Impact**: 
    #   - The code `return camel_case_str` simply returns the value of `camel_case_str`.
    #
    #Given the transformation from `snake_case_str` to `camel_case_str`, we know that each word in `snake_case_str` (separated by underscores) is capitalized and then joined together without any separators to form `camel_case_str`.
    #
    #**Output State**: **The program returns a camel case string where the first word is the first word of `snake_case_str` capitalized, and each subsequent word is also capitalized, all joined together without any separators.**
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string in snake case, splits it into words, capitalizes each word including the first one, and joins them together without any separators to form a camel case string, implicitly handling edge cases like empty strings or strings with leading/trailing underscores.
