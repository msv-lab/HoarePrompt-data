Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. In camel case, the first word is typically not capitalized. The function should only capitalize each word except the first one. 

For example, given the string "hello_world", the function should return "helloWorld", but it currently returns "HelloWorld". This indicates that the function does not properly handle the case where it should leave the first word in lowercase.

The line of code `camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))` capitalizes every word, including the first one, which is not the expected behavior for a camel case conversion. 

To fix this, the code could be modified to capitalize each word except the first one, like so:
```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
