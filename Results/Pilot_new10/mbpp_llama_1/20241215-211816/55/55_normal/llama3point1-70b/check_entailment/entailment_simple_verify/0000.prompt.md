You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
Program:
```
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided function does not correctly convert snake case strings to camel case strings. The issue lies in the way it capitalizes the first word. In camel case, the first word should be in lowercase, whereas the function capitalizes it. 

For example, if the input is 'hello_world', the function will return 'HelloWorld', but the correct camel case conversion is 'helloWorld'. 

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to not capitalize the first word. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_case_str is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where each word is separated by a single underscore.
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)
    return camel_case_str
    #To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the code's impact:
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, with each word separated by a single underscore.
    #   - `words` is a list of strings where each string is a word from `snake_case_str`. This implies that `words` has been split from `snake_case_str` based on the underscore.
    #   - `camel_case_str` is a string created by joining each word in `words` (which are first capitalized) without any separator.
    #
    #2. **Code Impact**: 
    #   - The code `return camel_case_str` simply returns the value of `camel_case_str`.
    #
    #Given the transformation from `snake_case_str` to `camel_case_str`, we know that each word in `snake_case_str` (separated by underscores) is capitalized and then joined together without any separators to form `camel_case_str`.
    #
    #**Output State**: **The program returns a camel case string where the first word is the first word of `snake_case_str` capitalized, and each subsequent word is also capitalized, all joined together without any separators.**


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
