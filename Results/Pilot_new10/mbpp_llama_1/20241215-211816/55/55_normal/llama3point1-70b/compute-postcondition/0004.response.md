Let's analyze the provided annotated code and return postconditions step by step to understand the functionality of the function.

1. **Function Parameters and Return Type**: 
   - The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `snake_case_str`.
   - The return type of the function is a string, specifically in camel case format.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function splits the input string `snake_case_str` into a list of words using the underscore as a delimiter.
   - It then capitalizes each word in the list using the `capitalize()` method and joins them together without any separators into a new string `camel_case_str`.
   - Finally, it returns the `camel_case_str`.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - The annotations and return postconditions mention that the function returns a camel case string, but they also specify that the first word remains in lowercase in the overall description, which contradicts the code's behavior where every word is capitalized.
   - The code does not handle the case where the input string is empty or contains leading/trailing underscores explicitly, but based on how `split()` and `capitalize()` work, an empty string would result in an empty list of words, leading to an empty string as the result. Leading/trailing underscores would result in empty strings in the list of words, which when capitalized and joined, would still result in an empty string at the beginning or end of the camel case string, respectively.
   - The annotations and return postconditions do not mention what happens if the input string contains characters other than lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, but the code would split and capitalize such strings without issue, including them in the resulting camel case string.

4. **Functionality Summary**:
   - The function accepts a string `snake_case_str`, splits it into words based on underscores, capitalizes each word, and joins them together without separators into a new string `camel_case_str`.
   - Every word in the resulting string is capitalized, including the first one, contrary to some annotations suggesting the first word should remain lowercase.
   - The function does not explicitly handle edge cases like empty strings or strings with leading/trailing underscores but handles them implicitly through the nature of string splitting and joining operations.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string in snake case, splits it into words, capitalizes each word including the first one, and joins them together without any separators to form a camel case string, implicitly handling edge cases like empty strings or strings with leading/trailing underscores. **
