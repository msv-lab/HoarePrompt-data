#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_str is a string that is a valid snake case string, i.e., it only contains lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, with words separated by single underscores.
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components)
    #The program returns a Pascal case string where each word from the original snake case string `snake_str` is capitalized and concatenated together without any separators.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string, splits it into components based on underscores, capitalizes the first letter of each component, and joins them together without separators, effectively converting snake case strings into Pascal case, while handling edge cases such as empty strings, single words, and non-standard input formats.
