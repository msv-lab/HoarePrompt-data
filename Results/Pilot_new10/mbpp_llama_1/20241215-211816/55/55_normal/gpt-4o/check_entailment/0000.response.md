Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. It converts the snake case string to title case and then joins the words, but it does not correctly handle the first letter of the resulting string. In a camel case string, the first letter of the first word should be lowercase, and the first letter of each subsequent word should be uppercase.

For example, if we call `func_1('hello_world')`, the program will return `'HelloWorld'`, but the correct camel case string should be `'helloWorld'`. 

The program should be modified to handle this case. For example:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))
```

This version of the function will return the correct camel case string.
