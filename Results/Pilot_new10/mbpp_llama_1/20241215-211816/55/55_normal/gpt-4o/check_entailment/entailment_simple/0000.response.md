Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly convert a snake case string to a camel case string as required by the problem description. 

Camel case strings require the first word to be in lowercase and the subsequent words to be capitalized, whereas the program returns a Pascal case string where each word is capitalized.

For example, the snake case string 'python_program' should be converted to 'pythonProgram' in camel case, but the program returns 'PythonProgram'. 

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components[1:])
```
