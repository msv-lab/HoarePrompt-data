To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it against the problem description.

The problem description requires a function to convert a snake case string to a camel case string. However, the provided function and its annotations indicate that it converts a snake case string to a Pascal case string instead. 

Here's the key difference:
- **Snake Case**: All lowercase letters, words separated by underscores (e.g., `python_program`).
- **Camel Case**: First word in lowercase, subsequent words capitalized, no separators (e.g., `pythonProgram`).
- **Pascal Case**: All words capitalized, no separators (e.g., `PythonProgram`).

Given the function:
```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components)
```
This function splits the input string into components based on underscores and then capitalizes the first letter of each component, joining them together without any separators. This effectively converts a snake case string into a Pascal case string, not camel case.

For example, given the snake case string `python_program`, the function will return `PythonProgram`, which is Pascal case, not camel case (`pythonProgram`).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case because it produces Pascal case output instead of the requested camel case output.

Correctness: **False**
