Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` appears to correctly implement the problem description. It converts the input integer `n` to a string `str_n`, then iterates over each digit in the string. For each digit, it checks if the frequency of the digit in the string (obtained using the `count` method) is greater than the digit itself (converted back to an integer). If it finds any digit where the frequency exceeds the digit's value, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all digits without finding such a case, it returns `True`, indicating that the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself.

To verify the correctness, let's consider various cases:

1. **Digits with frequency less than or equal to their value**: For example, the number 122. Here, the frequency of '1' is 1, '2' is 2, both of which are less than or equal to their respective digit values. The function correctly returns `True` for such cases.

2. **Digits with frequency greater than their value**: Consider the number 1112. The frequency of '1' is 3, which is greater than the digit '1' itself. The function correctly identifies this and returns `False`.

3. **Edge cases like single-digit numbers**: For a single-digit number, say 5, the frequency of the digit '5' is 1, which is less than 5. The function correctly handles such cases and returns `True`.

4. **Zero as a digit**: The problem doesn't explicitly mention zero, but if we consider a number like 100, the frequency of '0' is 2. Since the digit is '0', and its frequency (2) is greater than 0, the function should return `False` for such numbers, which it does.

Given these considerations, the function appears to correctly implement the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly checks the frequency of each digit in the input integer against the digit's value itself, returning `True` if all frequencies are less than or equal to their respective digits and `False` otherwise.
