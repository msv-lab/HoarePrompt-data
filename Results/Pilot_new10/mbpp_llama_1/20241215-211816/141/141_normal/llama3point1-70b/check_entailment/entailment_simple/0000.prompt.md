You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, and for every digit in `str_n`, its count in `str_n` is less than or equal to its integer value, unless the function returns False due to this condition being violated.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that for every digit in the string representation of `n`, its count in the string is less than or equal to its integer value.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
