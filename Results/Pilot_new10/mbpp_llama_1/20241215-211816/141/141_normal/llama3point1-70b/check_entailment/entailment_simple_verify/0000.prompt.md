You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function works by converting the integer to a string, then iterating over each digit in the string. For each digit, it counts the occurrences of the digit in the string using the `count` method and compares it to the digit itself, converted back to an integer.

This approach correctly implements the problem description. The function returns `False` as soon as it finds a digit whose frequency exceeds the digit itself and returns `True` if it checks all digits without finding such a case.

To verify the correctness, consider the following cases:
- If the input integer `n` has no repeating digits (e.g., 123), the function will return `True` because the count of each digit is 1, which is less than or equal to the digit itself.
- If the input integer `n` has repeating digits but the count of each digit does not exceed the digit itself (e.g., 111), the function will also return `True` because the count (3) is less than or equal to the digit (1 in this case) is not true, however the return value should be False for this example.
- For `n = 111`, str_n.count('1') is 3 which is greater than int('1') which is 1, so the function returns False as expected.

However, this example 111 (or any other similar examples) is handled correctly by the code as the function checks every potential case that the description says.

Therefore, the function is correct according to the given problem description, and it handles all potential cases as expected.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, and for every digit in `str_n`, its count in `str_n` is less than or equal to its integer value, unless the function returns False due to this condition being violated.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that for every digit in the string representation of `n`, its count in the string is less than or equal to its integer value.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
