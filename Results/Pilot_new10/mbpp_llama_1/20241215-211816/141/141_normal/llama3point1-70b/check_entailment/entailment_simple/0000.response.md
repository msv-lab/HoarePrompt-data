Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem description. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the function is correct:

1. **Input conversion to string**: The function converts the input integer `n` to a string `str_n`. This allows for easy iteration over each digit in the integer.
2. **Digit frequency check**: The function then iterates over each digit in the string representation of the integer. For each digit, it checks if the frequency of the digit (i.e., the number of times it appears in the string) is greater than the digit's integer value.
3. **Condition enforcement**: If the frequency of any digit exceeds its integer value, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the condition is not met.
4. **Correctness indication**: If the function completes the iteration over all digits without finding any violations of the condition, it returns `True`, indicating that the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to its integer value.

The function's logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, and it handles all possible cases correctly. It correctly checks the frequency of each digit in the integer and returns the expected result based on the condition specified in the problem description. 

For example, given the input `n = 121`, the function will correctly return `True` because the frequency of each digit (1 appears twice and 2 appears once) is less than or equal to its integer value. On the other hand, given the input `n = 122`, the function will correctly return `False` because the frequency of the digit 1 (which appears twice) exceeds its integer value.

In summary, the function is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description, handling all possible cases and returning the expected results.
