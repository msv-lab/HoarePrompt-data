You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` appears to correctly implement the problem description. It converts the input integer `n` to a string `str_n`, then iterates over each digit in the string. For each digit, it checks if the frequency of the digit in the string (obtained using the `count` method) is greater than the digit itself (converted back to an integer). If it finds any digit where the frequency exceeds the digit's value, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all digits without finding such a case, it returns `True`, indicating that the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself.

To verify the correctness, let's consider various cases:

1. **Digits with frequency less than or equal to their value**: For example, the number 122. Here, the frequency of '1' is 1, '2' is 2, both of which are less than or equal to their respective digit values. The function correctly returns `True` for such cases.

2. **Digits with frequency greater than their value**: Consider the number 1112. The frequency of '1' is 3, which is greater than the digit '1' itself. The function correctly identifies this and returns `False`.

3. **Edge cases like single-digit numbers**: For a single-digit number, say 5, the frequency of the digit '5' is 1, which is less than 5. The function correctly handles such cases and returns `True`.

4. **Zero as a digit**: The problem doesn't explicitly mention zero, but if we consider a number like 100, the frequency of '0' is 2. Since the digit is '0', and its frequency (2) is greater than 0, the function should return `False` for such numbers, which it does.

Given these considerations, the function appears to correctly implement the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly checks the frequency of each digit in the input integer against the digit's value itself, returning `True` if all frequencies are less than or equal to their respective digits and `False` otherwise.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, checks if the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to its integer value, and returns `True` if this condition holds for all digits; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
