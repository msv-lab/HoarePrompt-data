The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the function returns `False` in Cases 1, 2, and 3. In Case 4, the function returns `True` if for every digit in the string representation of `n`, its count in the string is less than or equal to its integer value. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return `True` if the digit count condition is met; otherwise, it returns `False` in all other cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `True` if for every digit in the string representation of `n`, its count in the string is less than or equal to its integer value; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
