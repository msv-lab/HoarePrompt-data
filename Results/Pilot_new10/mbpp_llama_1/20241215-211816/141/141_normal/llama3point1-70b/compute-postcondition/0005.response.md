According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `str_n`. If `str_n` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `str_n` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `str_n`, and the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. For the loop to execute again, `str_n` must have at least 2 characters, `digit` must be the second character in `str_n`, and the count of the new `digit` in `str_n` must be less than or equal to the integer value of the new `digit`. 
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string representation of `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in `str_n`, and the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`**
