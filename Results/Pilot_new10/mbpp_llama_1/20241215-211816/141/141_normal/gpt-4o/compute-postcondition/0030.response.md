The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n and converts it to a string to calculate the frequency of each digit. It then checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit. If any digit's frequency exceeds its integer value, the function immediately returns False. If the function completes the check without finding any such digit, it returns True. 

The function handles cases where n is a single-digit number, a multi-digit number, or zero. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where n is a negative integer or a non-integer, as these cases are not defined in the provided annotations. According to the code, if n is a negative integer, it will be converted to a string, and the function will attempt to calculate the frequency of each digit, which could result in incorrect results. If n is a non-integer, the function may also produce incorrect results or errors when attempting to convert it to a string.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer n, calculates the frequency of each digit in n, and returns True if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to its integer value; otherwise, it returns False, with potential undefined behavior for negative integers and non-integers **
