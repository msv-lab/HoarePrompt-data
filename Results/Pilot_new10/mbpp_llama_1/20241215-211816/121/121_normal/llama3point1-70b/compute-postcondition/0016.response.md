To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop statement is `while True:`, which means the loop will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement or an exception that stops its execution. Since the condition is always `True`, the loop can certainly execute one more time regardless of the current state of the variables.

Given this, no adjustments to the states of `n`, `num`, the return value of `func_1(num)`, `count`, or any other variable are necessary for the loop to execute again. The loop's continuation is not dependent on any variable's value because the loop condition is `True`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 8, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns an unknown value, `count` is 1, and `count` is not equal to `n`**
