To calculate the postcondition, we need to consider the given precondition and the if condition. The precondition states that `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `count` is 1, and `num` is 7. The if condition is `if (func_1(num))`, which means the function `func_1` called with the argument `num` (which is 7) returns `True` for the program to enter this condition.

Given that the specifics of `func_1` are not provided, we can only infer that for the program to enter the if statement, `func_1(num)` must evaluate to `True`. Since `num` is 7, this implies that `func_1(7)` returns `True`.

Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 7, and the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns `True`.**
