Based on the provided information and the loop code, the loop will continue to execute until `count` equals `n`. The `count` variable is incremented when `func_1(num)` returns `True` and `num` modulo 6 is either 1 or 5.

Given the loop's termination condition is implicit, depending on the return statement, we can infer that once `count` equals `n`, the loop will terminate because the function returns `num` at that point.

The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `count` is 1, and `num` is 7. 

After the loop finishes, `num` will be the value that made `count` equal to `n`, assuming such a value exists and the function `func_1(num)` returns `True` for that `num`. If no such value exists, the loop will theoretically run indefinitely, but based on the structure of the problem, we can assume it will terminate.

Thus, considering the conditions for the loop to terminate and the increments of `count`, we can deduce the following:

- `count` will be equal to `n` when the loop terminates, assuming `n` is achievable through the increments based on `func_1(num)` and the modulo condition.
- `num` will be the value that caused the loop to terminate, which means it satisfies the condition for `count` to equal `n`.
- The loop's execution depends on `func_1(num)` returning `True` and `num` modulo 6 being 1 or 5 for `count` to increment.

Therefore, the loop's output state after all iterations have executed would reflect the terminal conditions and the dependencies on the original and current values of the variables.

Output State: **`count` equals the original value of `n`, `num` is the value that made `count` equal to `n` and satisfies `func_1(num)` being `True` and `num` modulo 6 being 1 or 5, assuming such a `num` exists; otherwise, the loop's behavior is undefined in this context.**
