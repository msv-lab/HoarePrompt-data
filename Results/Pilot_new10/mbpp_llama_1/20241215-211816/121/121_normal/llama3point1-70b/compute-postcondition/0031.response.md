The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns specific values based on certain conditions. 

To break it down: 
- In Case_1, the function returns 7.
- In Case_2, the function also returns 7, with additional conditions related to a variable `num` and the result of calling another function `func_1` with `num` as an argument.
- In Case_3, the function returns 8, which is the value of `num`.
- In Case_4, the function returns 9, which is also the value of `num`.

Given these conditions, it appears that the function's return value depends on the evaluation of `num` and potentially other internal logic or function calls, but the primary input parameter is `n`, a positive integer.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return specific integer values (7, 8, or 9) based on the conditions outlined in the cases, which include the value of `num` and the outcome of calling `func_1` with `num` as an argument in one of the cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, and returns specific integer values (7, 8, or 9) based on internal conditions related to a variable `num` and the result of calling `func_1` with `num` as an argument in one case.**
