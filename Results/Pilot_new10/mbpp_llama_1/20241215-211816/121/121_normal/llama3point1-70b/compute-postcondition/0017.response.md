The code increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1, so the new value of `count` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is still 8, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument still returns an unknown value, and `count` is now 2. Also, since `count` was not equal to `n` initially and `count` has been incremented by 1, `count` is still not equal to `n` if `n` is greater than 2, but if `n` is equal to 2, then `count` is now equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 8, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns an unknown value, `count` is 2, and if `n` is not equal to 2 then `count` is not equal to `n`, otherwise `count` is equal to `n`.**
