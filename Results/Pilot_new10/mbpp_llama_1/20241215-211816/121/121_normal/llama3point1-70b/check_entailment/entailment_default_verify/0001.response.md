To determine the correctness of the program, let's break down the problem description and the provided code, along with the output hints.

The problem asks for a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. A Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, with 7 being the first such prime.

The provided code defines two functions:
- `func_1(n)` checks if a number `n` is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility up to the square root of `n` for larger numbers.
- `func_2(n)` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It starts from 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and increments a counter whenever it finds a prime number congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, stopping when it finds the nth such prime.

The output hints confirm the behavior of `func_1` and `func_2` as described. 

Given the problem description, the code, and the output hints, the original assessment not being explicitly provided means we must evaluate the program's correctness based solely on the information given.

The code correctly implements the logic for finding Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, starting from the first one (7) and then checking subsequent numbers that are both prime and have a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6. It handles the case for `n=1` correctly by returning 7 directly. For `n > 1`, it iterates through numbers, checking for primality and the modulo condition, accurately counting and returning the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, the program appears to be correct for its intended purpose. It accurately identifies and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number for a given positive integer `n`.

Final: **True**
