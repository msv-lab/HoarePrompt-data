You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the functionality to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. A Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. 

Function `func_1(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number. This is an optimized approach to check for primality.

Function `func_2(n)` uses `func_1(n)` to check if a number is prime and also checks if the number is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. It starts from 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and increments the count whenever it encounters a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime. Once the count reaches `n`, it returns the corresponding Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. It handles the base case correctly (when `n` is 1, it returns 7) and correctly increments the count for subsequent Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. 

The program also seems to be efficient as it checks for primality up to the square root of the number and only checks for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of the number.

In conclusion, the program appears to be correct as it accurately implements the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number and handles all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer greater than 1, and n is not less than 2
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is equal to `int(n
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer, and n is not equal to 1
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` equals the original value of `n`, `num` is the value that made `count` equal to `n` and satisfies `func_1(num)` being `True` and `num` modulo 6 being 1 or 5, assuming such a `num` exists; otherwise, the loop's behavior is undefined in this context.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
