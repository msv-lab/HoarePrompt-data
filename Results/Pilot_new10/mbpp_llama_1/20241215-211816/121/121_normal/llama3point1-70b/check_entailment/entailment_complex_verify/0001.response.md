The original assessment is "None", which means there is no initial evaluation of the program's correctness.

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to be implementing the correct logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The `func_1` function checks if a number is prime, and the `func_2` function uses this to find the nth number that is a prime and has a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6.

The annotated version of the code confirms this understanding and provides additional insight into the state of the program at different points. The annotations indicate that the program is correctly handling the cases where `n` is 1 and where `n` is greater than 1.

However, it's worth noting that the original assessment did not provide any evaluation of the program's correctness. This is likely because the assessment was "None", indicating that no evaluation was performed.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the program is correct. The logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` matches the problem description, and the annotated version of the code confirms this understanding.

Final: **True**
