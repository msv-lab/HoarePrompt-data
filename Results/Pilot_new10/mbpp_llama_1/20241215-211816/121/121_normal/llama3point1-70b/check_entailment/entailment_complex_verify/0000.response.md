Based on the provided code and the annotated version, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The code correctly implements the functionality to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number, and the function `func_2(n)` uses `func_1(n)` to check if a number is prime and also checks if the number is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. 

The annotated version of the code confirms this, as it describes the state of the program at different points and matches the expected behavior. The function `func_2(n)` starts from 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and increments the count whenever it encounters a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, which is consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate, as the code correctly implements the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

Final: **True**
