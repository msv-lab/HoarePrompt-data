Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. 

Here's why:

* The problem description asks for a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
* In number theory, a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.
* The function `func_2(n)` correctly implements this by starting from 7 (which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and then checking each subsequent number to see if it is prime and congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.
* The function `func_1(n)` is a helper function that checks if a number is prime. It correctly returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and for numbers that have divisors other than 1 and themselves.
* The `while` loop in `func_2(n)` continues to increment `num` until it finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, at which point it returns `num`.
* The base case for `n == 1` is handled correctly, returning 7 as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

The program should work correctly for all positive integers `n`, as it correctly checks for primality and the congruence condition. 

There are no obvious cases where the program would not follow the problem description, assuming that the inputs are valid (i.e., `n` is a positive integer). 

The overall structure of the program, including the use of a helper function for primality testing and the `while` loop to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, is logical and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand the program's behavior. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
