The code swaps the values of `S0` and `S1` with `S1` and `S_next` respectively. 

So, `S0` is assigned the value of `S1`, which is 3, and `S1` is assigned the value of `S_next`, which is 7. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**
