According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 2, which means the loop has just started or is at its first iteration. Since `i` is less than 2 and the loop starts from 2, it means `i` must be 2 at the end of the previous iteration (or the start of the current iteration from the loop's perspective). 

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 3. Also, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the current `i`, which is 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 3**
