The code swaps the values of `S0` and `S1` with `S1` and `S_next` respectively. 
So, `S0` becomes `S1` which is 7 and `S1` becomes `S_next` which is 17.
The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `S0` is 7, `S1` is 17, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**
