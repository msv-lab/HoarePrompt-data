Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but the provided function does not do that. 

Instead, the function appears to be generating a sequence of numbers using the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, which is not related to the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers.

Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers that are defined using a specific formula, but this formula is not implemented in the given function. The function provided seems to be calculating a different sequence of numbers, and it does not perform any primality tests to check if the generated numbers are prime.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for any potential case, and its correctness is **False**. 

A correct implementation of the function would involve generating the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers and returning the nth prime number in the sequence. This would require a different approach and algorithm than the one used in the provided function.
