You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program is trying to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number sequence is defined as the sequence of prime numbers of the form 4n^2 - 2n + 1, but the given program does not generate this sequence.

The given program appears to be generating a sequence based on the recursive formula S_next = 2 * S1 + S0, which does not match the definition of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. The provided unit tests also do not cover the cases where n is greater than 5 or where the result is not a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should generate prime numbers of the form 4n^2 - 2n + 1 and return the nth prime number in the sequence. The given program does not perform this task and therefore is not correct.

Here's an example case where the program does not work correctly:

If we call `func_1(1)`, the program returns `1`, but `1` is not considered a prime number. The correct first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number is `7` (which is `4(1)^2 - 2(1) + 1`), so the function should return `7` when `n` is `1`. However, the function does not handle this case correctly. 

A correct implementation of the function would involve checking if a number is prime and generating the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers, which the given program does not do.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n`, returns 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, and for `n > 1`, returns the `n`-th term of a sequence where each term is calculated as `2 * previous_term + term_before_previous`. The function is designed for non-negative integer inputs and may throw errors for negative integers or non-integer inputs due to the nature of the `range` function in Python.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
