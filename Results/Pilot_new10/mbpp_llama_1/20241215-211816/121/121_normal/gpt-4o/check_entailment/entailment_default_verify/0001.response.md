The problem description asks for a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the provided code does not appear to be finding prime numbers at all. It is instead calculating the nth term of a sequence where each term is calculated as 2 * previous_term + term_before_previous.

Given the output hints, it becomes clear that the function is designed to calculate this sequence, not to find Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. The function does correctly calculate the sequence as described by the output hints, but it does not solve the problem as described.

The original assessment is "None", which means it did not provide any information about the correctness of the program. Based on the problem description and the output hints, it is clear that the original assessment should have been "False" because the program does not solve the problem it is supposed to solve.

Final: **False**
