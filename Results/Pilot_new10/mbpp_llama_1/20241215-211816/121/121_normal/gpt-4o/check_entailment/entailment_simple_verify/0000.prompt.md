You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description because it does not generate Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime sequence is a sequence of prime numbers P(n) defined by the recurrence relation: P(n) = 2 * P(n-1) + P(n-2), with initial conditions P(0) = 7 and P(1) = 17. 

The provided program does not match this definition. It starts with S0 = 1 and S1 = 1, and generates the sequence using the same recurrence relation, but with different initial conditions. Therefore, it does not correctly generate Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. 

For example, func_1(0) should return 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime), but it returns 1, which is not a prime number and not the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime. 

This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected, so its correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0 or n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer, and n is neither 0 nor 1, which implies that n is greater than 1
    S0, S1 = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        
        S0, S1 = S1, S_next
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `S0` is the second to last term in the sequence, `S1` is the last term in the sequence where each term is calculated as `2 * previous_term + term_before_previous`, `i` is `n + 1`.
    return S1
    #The program returns S1, which is the last term in the sequence calculated as per the given formula, where each term depends on the two preceding terms.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
