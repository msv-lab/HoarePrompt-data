Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input, and returns a tuple of two lists. The first list in the tuple is a slice of the original list from index 0 to `L`, and the second list is a slice of the original list from index `L` to the end.

This function works correctly for all potential cases because it handles the list slicing operation correctly, regardless of the input. If `L` is greater than the length of the list, the first part of the tuple will be the entire list and the second part will be an empty list, which is the expected behavior.

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `L = 3`, the function will return `([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])`. If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `L = 10`, the function will return `([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [])`.

The function also handles edge cases correctly, such as when `L` is 0 or negative. In these cases, the function will return `([], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` and `([], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` respectively.

Overall, the function is correct because it correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the input integer `L`, and handles all potential cases and edge cases correctly.
