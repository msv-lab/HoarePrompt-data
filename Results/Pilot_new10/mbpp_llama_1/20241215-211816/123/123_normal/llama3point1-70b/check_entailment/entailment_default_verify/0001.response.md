The original assessment states that the program is correct, and the output hints provided align with the expected behavior of the program as described in the problem statement. The program uses Python's list slicing feature to split the input list into two parts, and it handles edge cases such as when `L` is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, when `L` is 0, and when `lst` is empty.

Upon reviewing the problem description, the program, the original assessment, and the output hints, I find that the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the function as described, and the output hints demonstrate the expected behavior of the program.

One potential issue that could be raised is the handling of negative values for `L`, but the problem description and output hints specify that `L` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, under the assumption that the input will always be valid and non-negative, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
