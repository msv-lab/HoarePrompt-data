You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the function as described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns a tuple of two lists, where the first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst` and the second list contains the remaining elements.

The function uses Python's list slicing feature to split the input list into two parts. The expression `lst[:L]` generates a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the expression `lst[L:]` generates a new list containing all elements of `lst` starting from the `L`-th index.

This implementation works correctly for all possible cases, including:

* When `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the function returns a tuple containing the original list and an empty list.
* When `L` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function returns a tuple containing the original list and an empty list, because `lst[L:]` will be an empty list.
* When `L` is less than zero, the function will also work correctly, but it will effectively return the original list and an empty list, because `lst[:L]` will be an empty list.
* When the input list is empty, the function will return a tuple containing two empty lists, which is the expected behavior.

Overall, the program is correct and implements the function as described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple of two lists where the first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst` and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`; if `L` is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, the first list contains all elements of `lst` and the second list is empty; if `L` is 0, the first list is empty and the second list contains all elements of `lst`; if `lst` is empty, both lists in the tuple are empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
