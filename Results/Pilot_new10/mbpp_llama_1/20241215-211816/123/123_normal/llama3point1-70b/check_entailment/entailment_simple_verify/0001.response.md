The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness.

Based on the problem description, the program is supposed to split a given list into two parts, where the length of the first part is L, and return the resulting lists in a tuple.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input, and returns a tuple of two lists: `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`. This corresponds to the problem description, as it splits the input list into two parts at index L.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function returns a tuple of two lists, where the first list contains the first L elements of the input list, and the second list contains the remaining elements.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., `lst` is a list and `L` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst)), the program correctly implements the desired functionality.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
