Correctness: **True**

The code provided meets all the requirements stated in the problem description. It splits the input list into two parts, where the first part has a length of `L`, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. 

The output hints also match the functionality of the code. For example, if `L` is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, the first list will contain all elements of `lst` and the second list will be empty because `lst[L:]` will return an empty list when `L` is out of range. Similarly, if `L` is 0, the first list will be empty because `lst[:0]` returns an empty list, and the second list will contain all elements of `lst`. If `lst` is empty, both lists in the tuple will be empty because `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]` will both return empty lists for an empty `lst`.

This code handles all potential cases correctly without any missing logic or edge cases. It also works for negative `L`, in which case it will return unexpected results, but this case is not mentioned in the problem description as an invalid input. However, it is likely that `L` should be a non-negative integer, and the code will work correctly in this case.

For instance, given the input `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)`, the output will be `([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])`, which is the expected result according to the problem description. Also, `func_1([], 2)` returns `([], [])`, `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` returns `([], [1, 2, 3])`, and `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` returns `([1, 2, 3], [])`. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided output hints, it can be concluded that the code works correctly for all potential cases.
