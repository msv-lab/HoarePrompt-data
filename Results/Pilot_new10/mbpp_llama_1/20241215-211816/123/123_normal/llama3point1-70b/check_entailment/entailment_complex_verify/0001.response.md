The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial judgment made about the program's correctness. 

Given the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` seems to correctly implement the required functionality. It takes a list and an integer, splits the list into two parts based on the integer, and returns these parts as a tuple.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment. It accurately describes the state of the program before the function call, the operation performed by the function, and the overall result. The annotations indicate that the function behaves as expected in different scenarios, such as when the integer is greater than or equal to the length of the list, when it is 0, or when the list is empty.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, it appears that the function correctly implements the desired functionality.

The reason the original assessment ("None") does not provide any information about the program's correctness is that there was no analysis performed beforehand. However, with the information provided now, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
