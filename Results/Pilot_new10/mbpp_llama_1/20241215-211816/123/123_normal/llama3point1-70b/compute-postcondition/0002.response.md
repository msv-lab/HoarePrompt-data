The function func_1 accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L` as parameters. According to the code, it returns a tuple of two lists: the first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`. This is achieved by using Python's list slicing feature. The code does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur, such as `L` being greater than the length of `lst`. However, in Python, if `L` is greater than the length of `lst`, the list slicing operation will simply return the entire list as the first element of the tuple and an empty list as the second element. 

The potential edge cases to consider are: 
- When `L` is 0, the function returns an empty list as the first element of the tuple and the entire list `lst` as the second element.
- When `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the function returns the entire list `lst` as the first element of the tuple and an empty list as the second element.
- When `L` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function returns the entire list `lst` as the first element of the tuple and an empty list as the second element.
- When `lst` is an empty list, the function returns two empty lists as a tuple, regardless of the value of `L`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple of two lists where the first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst` and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`; if `L` is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, the first list contains all elements of `lst` and the second list is empty; if `L` is 0, the first list is empty and the second list contains all elements of `lst`; if `lst` is empty, both lists in the tuple are empty. **
