The program returns two values: the first value is a slice of the list `lst` from the start of the list up to index `L`, and the second value is a slice of the list `lst` from index `L` to the end of the list. 

Since `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, the first slice `lst[:L]` will contain the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second slice `lst[L:]` will contain the remaining elements of `lst`. 

If `L` is equal to `0`, the first slice will be an empty list and the second slice will be the entire list `lst`. If `L` is equal to `len(lst)`, the first slice will be the entire list `lst` and the second slice will be an empty list.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple of two lists: the first list contains the first L elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`.**
