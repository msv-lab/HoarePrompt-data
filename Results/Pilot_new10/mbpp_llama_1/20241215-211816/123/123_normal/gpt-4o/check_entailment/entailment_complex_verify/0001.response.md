The original assessment is "None", which means it does not provide any information about the correctness of the program. 

However, after analyzing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, we can see that the function `func_1` splits the input list into two parts at the specified index `L` and returns these two parts. The first part contains elements from the start of the list up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second part contains elements from index `L` to the end of the list. 

The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of how the function works and what it returns. It also explains the different possible cases based on the value of `L`, which helps to ensure that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.

Based on this analysis, the program seems to be correct according to the problem description. The function correctly splits the list into two parts at the specified index and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.

The reason we believe the original assessment is not necessary in this case is that the problem description and the code itself are sufficient to determine the correctness of the program. The annotated version of the code provides additional information that confirms the correctness of the program.

Therefore, we conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
