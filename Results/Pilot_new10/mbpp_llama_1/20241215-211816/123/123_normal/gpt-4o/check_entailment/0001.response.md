Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is determined by the integer `L`, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.

The function uses Python's list slicing feature, `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`, to achieve this. The first slice, `lst[:L]`, returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of the original list, and the second slice, `lst[L:]`, returns a new list containing all elements starting from index `L` to the end of the original list.

This approach correctly handles various edge cases, including:

1.  When `L` is 0, the function returns an empty list as the first tuple element and the original list as the second tuple element.
2.  When `L` is equal to the length of the list, the function returns the original list as the first tuple element and an empty list as the second tuple element.
3.  When `L` is greater than the length of the list, Python's list slicing will simply return the original list as the first tuple element and an empty list as the second tuple element, without raising any errors.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios. Since the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem, and there are no known edge cases where the function does not work as expected, the correctness of the function is verified.
