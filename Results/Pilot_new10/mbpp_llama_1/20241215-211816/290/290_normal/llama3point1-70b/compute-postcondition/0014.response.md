The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input. It splits the string into a list of words and checks each word to see if it contains the character 'z' in its middle characters (excluding the first and last characters). If it finds such a word, it immediately returns `True`. If it checks all words without finding such a condition, it returns `False`. 

The annotations mention that the function returns `None` after checking all words if no word meets the condition, but the code actually returns `False` in this case. Therefore, the functionality of the function should reflect this.

Additionally, the function does not handle any potential edge cases such as an empty string, a string with only one word, or a string with words that have only one or two characters. However, the code will still work correctly in these cases, returning `False` for an empty string or a string with no words containing 'z' in their middle characters.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s`, splits it into words, and checks each word for the presence of 'z' in its middle characters (excluding the first and last characters), returning `True` if such a word is found and `False` otherwise, including cases where the input string is empty or contains no words with 'z' in their middle characters **
