You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct as it checks each word in the input string to see if it contains the letter 'z' in any position except the first and last characters. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code works:

1. The input string `s` is split into individual words using the `split()` method.
2. The code then iterates over each word in the list of words.
3. For each word, it checks two conditions: 
   - The length of the word is more than 1 character (`len(word) > 1`). This is necessary because the problem statement asks to check for 'z' in positions other than the start and end of the word. If the word has only one character, it doesn't make sense to talk about positions other than the start and end.
   - The word contains 'z' in any position except the first and last characters (`'z' in word[1:-1]`).
4. If both conditions are met for any word, the function immediately returns `True`.
5. If the function iterates over all words without finding any that meet the conditions, it returns `False`.

This logic aligns with the problem description, and there doesn't seem to be any edge case that the code does not handle correctly. For example, it correctly handles:
- Empty strings: The `split()` method will return an empty list, and the `for` loop will not execute, resulting in a return value of `False`.
- Single-character strings: These will be ignored due to the `len(word) > 1` check.
- Strings with 'z' at the start or end of a word: These will be ignored because of the `word[1:-1]` slicing.
- Strings with no 'z' at all: The function will return `False` after checking all words. 

Given the detailed explanation above and the fact that no counterexample can be found, it appears that the code correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string `s`, splits it into words, and checks each word for the presence of 'z' in its middle characters (excluding the first and last characters), returning `True` if such a word is found and `False` otherwise, including cases where the input string is empty or contains no words with 'z' in their middle characters

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
