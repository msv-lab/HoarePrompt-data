#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of substrings of `s`, the function returns `True` if any word in `words` has 'z' in its middle characters (excluding the first and last characters), otherwise, it returns `None` after checking all words; `word` is the last word in `words` if the loop completes without finding such a condition, or the specific word that caused the function to return `True` if such a condition is met.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s`, splits it into words, and checks each word for the presence of 'z' in its middle characters (excluding the first and last characters), returning `True` if such a word is found and `False` otherwise, including cases where the input string is empty or contains no words with 'z' in their middle characters
