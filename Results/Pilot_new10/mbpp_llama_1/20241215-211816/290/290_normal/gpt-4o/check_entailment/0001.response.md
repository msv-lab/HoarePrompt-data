Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks if a string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word. It does this by using Python's string slicing feature, `s[1:-1]`, which returns a new string that includes all characters from the original string except the first and last ones. The function then checks if 'z' is in this new string.

The given unit tests support this claim:
- `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is found in the middle of the string.
- `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.
- `func_1('  lang .')` returns `False` because 'z' is not found in the string.

After analyzing the function and considering various potential cases, it appears that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. It correctly identifies strings that contain 'z' in any position except the first and last characters. Therefore, without any counterexamples, the code can be considered correct for the given problem description.
