Correctness: **True**

The program provided checks if a string contains the character 'z' in any position except at the start and end of the word. It uses Python's string slicing feature (`s[1:-1]`) to exclude the first and last characters of the string, and then checks if 'z' is present in the remaining substring using the `in` operator.

The provided unit tests also validate this behavior:

- `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the middle of the string.
- `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.
- `func_1('  lang .')` returns `False` because 'z' is not present in the string at all.

This function works correctly for all potential cases because it correctly checks for the presence of 'z' in the middle of the string (excluding the first and last characters), and returns `True` if 'z' is found, and `False` otherwise. The use of `s[1:-1]` ensures that the first and last characters are excluded from the check, aligning with the problem description.
