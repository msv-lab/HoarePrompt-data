Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement. 

The problem statement asks for a function that checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. The provided Python function `func_1` checks if the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters (`s[1:-1]`) contains the character 'z'.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Checking 'z' in the substring excluding the first and last characters**: The function uses Python's slice notation `s[1:-1]` to get the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters. This ensures that the function does not consider 'z' at the start and end of the string.

2. **Using the `in` operator to check for 'z'**: The function uses the `in` operator to check if 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]`. This is the most straightforward and efficient way to check if a character is present in a string in Python.

3. **Correct return values**: The function returns `True` as soon as it finds 'z' in the substring, which is correct according to the problem statement. If 'z' is not found in the substring, the function returns `False`, which is also correct.

4. **Handling edge cases**: The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function handles edge cases correctly. For example, the test `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False` shows that the function correctly handles the case where 'z' is at the start of the string, and the test `assert func_1('  lang .') == False` shows that the function correctly handles the case where 'z' is not present in the string.

Overall, the program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement, and it handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
