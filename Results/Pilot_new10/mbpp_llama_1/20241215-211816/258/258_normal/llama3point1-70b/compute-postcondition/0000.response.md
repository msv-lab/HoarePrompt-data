The code converts the integer `num` to a string and assigns it to `num_str`. The initial state states that `num` is a non-negative integer. 

`num_str` is assigned the value of `str(num)`, which is a string representation of the non-negative integer `num`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`.
Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`**
