According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_str`. If `num_str` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, and `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` will not be empty if `num` is not 0. However, if `num` is 0, `num_str` will still be '0', which is not empty. So, `num_str` will always have at least one character.

At the start of the loop, `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is equal to the number of digits in `num`, and `sum` is 0. For the loop to be executed, `num_str` must have at least one character, and `digit` is the first character in `num_str`.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least 1 character, `num_len` is equal to the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is 0, `digit` is the first character in `num_str`**
