To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code: `sum += int(digit) ** num_len`.

- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is a string representation of `num` with at least 1 character.
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, which also equals the length of `num_str` since `num_str` represents `num`.
- `sum` initially is 0.
- `digit` is the first character in `num_str`, which means it's the first digit of `num` when `num` is considered as a string.

When we execute `sum += int(digit) ** num_len`, here's what happens:
- `int(digit)` converts the first digit of `num` (as a string) back into an integer.
- `int(digit) ** num_len` raises this integer to the power of `num_len`, the number of digits in `num`.
- The result of this exponentiation is added to `sum`, which initially is 0.

Therefore, `sum` becomes `int(digit) ** num_len`, because it was initially 0 and we are adding `int(digit) ** num_len` to it.

Considering all variables and their initial conditions:
- `num` remains a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` remains the string representation of `num`.
- `num_len` remains the number of digits in `num`, equal to the length of `num_str`.
- `sum` becomes `int(digit) ** num_len`.
- `digit` remains the first character in `num_str`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is `int(digit) ** num_len`, `digit` is the first character in `num_str`.**
