To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is the string representation of `num` with at least two digits.
- `num_len` is at least 2.
- `sum` is the sum of the integer values of the first digit(s) of `num`.

Given the code:
```python
sum += int(digit) ** num_len
```

However, the variable `digit` is not defined in the initial state. For the purpose of this analysis, we'll consider `digit` as a variable that holds a single digit from `num_str`, but the specific digit is not specified. The impact of this operation would vary depending on which digit is being considered.

Assuming `digit` represents a digit from `num_str` (and without loss of generality, let's consider it as part of the process to update `sum` based on some digit of `num`), the value of `sum` would increase by the result of `int(digit) ** num_len`.

Thus, the output state is:
- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is the string representation of `num` with at least two digits.
- `num_len` is at least 2.
- `sum` is the original sum of the integer values of the first digit(s) of `num` plus `int(digit) ** num_len`, where `digit` is a specific digit from `num_str` used in the calculation.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` with at least two digits, `num_len` is at least 2, `sum` is the original sum of the integer values of the first digit(s) of `num` plus `int(digit) ** num_len`**
