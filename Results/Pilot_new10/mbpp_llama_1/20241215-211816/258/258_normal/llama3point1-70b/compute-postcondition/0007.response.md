According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_str`. If `num_str` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` has at least two digits, `num_len` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `num_str` must have at least one more character, meaning it must have at least 3 digits if we are considering the last iteration had 2 digits, and `num_len` must be at least 3.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` with at least three digits, `num_len` is at least 3, `sum` is the sum of the integer values of the first two digit(s) of `num`**
