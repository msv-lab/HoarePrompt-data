To understand the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Input Parameter**: The function accepts a non-negative integer `num`.
2. **Calculation**:
   - It converts `num` to a string `num_str` to easily iterate over each digit.
   - It calculates `num_len`, which is the number of digits in `num`.
   - It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will store the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.
   - It then iterates over each character (digit) in `num_str`, converts the digit back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and adds this value to `sum`.

3. **Return Value**:
   - After calculating the sum, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether this sum equals the original input `num`.

Analyzing the code and considering potential edge cases:

- **Edge Case 1**: If `num` is 0, `num_str` is "0", `num_len` is 1, and the loop will execute once. Since 0 raised to the power of 1 is 0, `sum` will be 0, and the function will return `True` because 0 equals 0.
- **Edge Case 2**: For single-digit numbers, `num_len` is 1. Each digit raised to the power of 1 is itself. Therefore, for single-digit numbers, `sum` equals `num` only if `num` is 1 (since 1^1 = 1), and the function will return `True` for `num = 1` and `False` for other single-digit numbers.
- **General Case**: For multi-digit numbers, the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits is calculated. The function checks if this sum equals the original number and returns `True` if they are equal, `False` otherwise.

Considering all potential cases and the actual code operation, the functionality of the function is to check if the sum of each digit in the input number `num` raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num` equals `num` itself, and return `True` if they are equal, `False` otherwise. This includes handling edge cases such as when `num` is 0 or a single-digit number.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `num`, calculates the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num`, and returns `True` if this sum equals `num`, and `False` otherwise, covering all potential cases including edge cases for 0 and single-digit numbers. **
