Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The provided function `func_1(num)` works as follows:
- It converts the input number `num` into a string `num_str` to easily calculate the number of digits `num_len`.
- It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will store the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len`.
- It then iterates over each digit in `num_str`, raises the digit to the power of `num_len`, and adds the result to `sum`.
- Finally, it checks if the calculated `sum` equals the original input `num` and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that `num` is an Armstrong number, and `False` otherwise.

This function correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases like 0 and single-digit numbers. For example, for the input 371, the function calculates (3^3) + (7^3) + (1^3) = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371, which equals the input, so it correctly returns `True`. For 123, it calculates (1^3) + (2^3) + (3^3) = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36, which does not equal the input, so it correctly returns `False`.

The output hints provided agree with the functionality of the code, covering all potential cases and edge cases. Given that the function accurately implements the definition of an Armstrong number and handles all types of inputs correctly, the code is deemed correct.
