The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. However, the problem description defines an Armstrong number as a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. The provided code, on the other hand, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits in the number, not necessarily the cube of the digits.

The output hints suggest that the function calculates the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num`, which is consistent with the provided code. However, this does not match the definition of an Armstrong number provided in the problem description.

Based on the problem description, the correct implementation of the function should calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits, not the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
