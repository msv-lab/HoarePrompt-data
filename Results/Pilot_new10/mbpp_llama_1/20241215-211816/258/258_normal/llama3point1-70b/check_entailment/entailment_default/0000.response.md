Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function `func_1(num)` works as follows:

1.  It converts the number into a string `num_str` to find the number of digits `num_len`.
2.  It calculates the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num`.
3.  It returns `True` if this sum equals `num`, and `False` otherwise.

The function correctly handles edge cases such as 0 and single-digit numbers. For example, when the input is 0 (which has one digit), the function will calculate 0^1 = 0 and return True. For single-digit numbers, the function will return True because any single-digit number is equal to itself raised to the power of 1.

The output hints agree with the code, covering all potential cases including edge cases for 0 and single-digit numbers. Therefore, the function implements the problem description correctly for every potential case.
