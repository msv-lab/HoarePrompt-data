You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` checks whether a number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3*3*3 + 7*7*7 + 1*1*1 = 371.

The function works by first converting the input number to a string, then calculating the length of the string (i.e., the number of digits in the number). It then iterates over each digit in the string, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and adds it to a running sum. Finally, it checks if the sum is equal to the original number, and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

This function appears to be correct for all potential cases. It handles numbers with different numbers of digits correctly, and it correctly identifies Armstrong numbers and non-Armstrong numbers. 

For example, `func_1(371)` returns `True`, because 371 is an Armstrong number (3*3*3 + 7*7*7 + 1*1*1 = 371). On the other hand, `func_1(123)` returns `False`, because 123 is not an Armstrong number (1*1*1 + 2*2*2 + 3*3*3 = 32, not 123).

Overall, the function seems to be working correctly for all potential cases, so the correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `num` is a non-negative integer.
    #   - `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.
    #   - `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`.
    #   - `sum` is 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```
    #   for digit in num_str:
    #       sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    #   ```
    #   This loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `num`. For each digit, it converts the digit back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len` (the total number of digits in `num`), and adds this value to `sum`.
    #
    #3. **Understanding the Loop's Behavior**:
    #   - If `num` has 0 digits (which is the case when `num` is 0), `num_str` is "0", and `num_len` is 1. The loop will execute once, converting "0" to an integer, raising it to the power of 1, and adding 0 to `sum`. Thus, `sum` remains 0.
    #   - If `num` has 1 or more digits, the loop will execute for each digit. For each digit, it calculates the digit raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num` and adds this to `sum`.
    #   - The key observation is that `num_len` does not change within the loop, so each digit is raised to the same power, which is the total number of digits in `num`.
    #
    #4. **Determining the Output State**:
    #   - `num` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `num_str` also remains unchanged as it is just a string representation of `num` and does not change within the loop.
    #   - `num_len` remains the same, as it is calculated before the loop and does not change within the loop.
    #   - `sum` will be the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`. If `num` is 0, `sum` remains 0.
    #
    #Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:
    #
    #- If `num` is 0, `sum` is 0.
    #- If `num` is not 0, `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num`.
    #
    #**Output State: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`, or 0 if `num` is 0.**
    return sum == num
    #The program returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the sum of each digit in `num` (a non-negative integer) raised to the power of `num_len` (the number of digits in `num`), or 0 if `num` is 0, is equal to `num`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
