Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(num)` checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function works by converting the number to a string, calculating the length of the string (i.e., the number of digits), and then iterating over each digit in the string. For each digit, it raises the digit to the power of the number of digits and adds it to a running sum. Finally, it checks if the sum is equal to the original number.

This function appears to handle all potential cases correctly:

- It correctly handles single-digit numbers (e.g., 5, 6), as these are trivially Armstrong numbers.
- It correctly handles multi-digit numbers (e.g., 153, 1634), raising each digit to the correct power and checking for equality with the original number.
- It also handles edge cases, such as numbers with leading zeros (when converted to strings), though the leading zeros do not affect the calculation since they are raised to a power and their contribution to the sum remains 0.

Given the straightforward and accurate implementation of the Armstrong number check, the function is correct for all potential cases, and no counterexamples could be found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
