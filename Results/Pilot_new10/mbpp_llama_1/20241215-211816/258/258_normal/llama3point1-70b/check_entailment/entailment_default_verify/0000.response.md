To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the key points:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

2. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment concludes that the provided function `func_1(num)` is correct for checking whether a given number is an Armstrong number. It highlights the function's ability to handle single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and edge cases correctly.

3. **Output Hints**: The output hints summarize the code's functionality, stating that it calculates the sum of each digit in the input number raised to the power of the number of digits in the number and returns whether this sum equals the original number. It mentions covering all potential cases, including edge cases for 0 and single-digit numbers.

Based on the problem description, the original code, and the output hints, the original assessment seems to align with the expected functionality of an Armstrong number checker. The function `func_1(num)` correctly implements the definition of an Armstrong number by summing the digits of the input number each raised to the power of the number of digits and comparing this sum to the original number. This matches the problem description and is reinforced by the output hints.

The reason the original assessment is accurate is that the function behaves as expected for Armstrong numbers (e.g., 153, where 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153) and for non-Armstrong numbers (e.g., 12, where 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5, not equal to 12). It also correctly handles edge cases like 0 (0^1 = 0) and single-digit numbers (e.g., 5, where 5^1 = 5).

Therefore, considering the problem description, the code provided, and the output hints, the final assessment is that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
