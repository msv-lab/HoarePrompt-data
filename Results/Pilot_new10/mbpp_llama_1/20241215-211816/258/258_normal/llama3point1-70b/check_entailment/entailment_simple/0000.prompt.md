You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `num` is a non-negative integer.
    #   - `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.
    #   - `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`.
    #   - `sum` is 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```
    #   for digit in num_str:
    #       sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    #   ```
    #   This loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `num`. For each digit, it converts the digit back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len` (the total number of digits in `num`), and adds this value to `sum`.
    #
    #3. **Understanding the Loop's Behavior**:
    #   - If `num` has 0 digits (which is the case when `num` is 0), `num_str` is "0", and `num_len` is 1. The loop will execute once, converting "0" to an integer, raising it to the power of 1, and adding 0 to `sum`. Thus, `sum` remains 0.
    #   - If `num` has 1 or more digits, the loop will execute for each digit. For each digit, it calculates the digit raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num` and adds this to `sum`.
    #   - The key observation is that `num_len` does not change within the loop, so each digit is raised to the same power, which is the total number of digits in `num`.
    #
    #4. **Determining the Output State**:
    #   - `num` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `num_str` also remains unchanged as it is just a string representation of `num` and does not change within the loop.
    #   - `num_len` remains the same, as it is calculated before the loop and does not change within the loop.
    #   - `sum` will be the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`. If `num` is 0, `sum` remains 0.
    #
    #Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:
    #
    #- If `num` is 0, `sum` is 0.
    #- If `num` is not 0, `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num`.
    #
    #**Output State: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`, or 0 if `num` is 0.**
    return sum == num
    #The program returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the sum of each digit in `num` (a non-negative integer) raised to the power of `num_len` (the number of digits in `num`), or 0 if `num` is 0, is equal to `num`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
