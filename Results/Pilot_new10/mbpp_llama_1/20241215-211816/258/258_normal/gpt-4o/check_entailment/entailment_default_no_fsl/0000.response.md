Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that equals the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.

The function works by first converting the input number `n` to a string `num_str` to easily calculate the number of digits `num_len` in `n`. It then calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` using a generator expression and checks if this sum equals the original number `n`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) and output hints suggest that the function works correctly for various inputs. The function handles non-negative integers and returns `True` if the number is an Armstrong number and `False` otherwise.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears to correctly implement the logic for checking Armstrong numbers. It correctly handles the calculation of the sum of digits raised to the power of the number of digits and compares this sum to the original number.

The code does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. It correctly handles the provided test cases and should work correctly for all non-negative integers.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description, program code, and output hints, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
