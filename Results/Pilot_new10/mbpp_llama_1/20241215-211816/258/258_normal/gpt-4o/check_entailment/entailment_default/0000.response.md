Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number. 

The code works as follows: 
- It first converts the input number `n` into a string `num_str` to easily calculate the number of digits `num_len`.
- Then it calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` using a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function.
- Finally, it checks if this sum is equal to the original number `n`, returning `True` if they are equal (indicating `n` is an Armstrong number) and `False` otherwise.

The output hints align with the code's functionality, indicating the function will return `True` for Armstrong numbers and `False` for non-Armstrong numbers, which matches the problem description. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the function's correctness for specific examples. Since the code accurately implements the definition of an Armstrong number and handles the calculation correctly for all potential cases (as it depends solely on the mathematical properties of the numbers and not on any specific edge cases that the code might fail to handle), the code is correct for every potential case.
