Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that equals the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.

The program implements this definition correctly:

1. It converts the input number `n` to a string `num_str` to easily access each digit.
2. It calculates the number of digits `num_len` in the number.
3. It calculates the sum of the digits each raised to the power of `num_len` using a generator expression.
4. It returns `True` if the calculated sum equals the original number `n`, and `False` otherwise.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function works correctly for different inputs.

For example, the number 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153. The function correctly returns `True` for this input.

The function handles all potential cases because it uses a general approach that works for any non-negative integer. It does not rely on any specific properties of the input number, except that it is a non-negative integer.

Overall, the program accurately implements the definition of an Armstrong number and meets the problem description.
