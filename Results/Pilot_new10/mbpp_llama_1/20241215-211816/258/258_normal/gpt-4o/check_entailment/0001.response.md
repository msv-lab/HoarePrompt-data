Correctness: **True**

The program provided checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function `func_1(n)` works as follows:

1. It converts the input number `n` to a string `num_str` to easily get the number of digits and access each digit.
2. It calculates the number of digits `num_len` in the input number.
3. It calculates the sum `armstrong_sum` of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` using a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function.
4. It checks if `armstrong_sum` is equal to the original number `n`, returning `True` if they are equal (indicating an Armstrong number) and `False` otherwise.

This logic accurately implements the definition of an Armstrong number, and it handles numbers of any length. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate its correctness for specific cases, including both Armstrong and non-Armstrong numbers. Without finding any case where the program fails to correctly identify an Armstrong number, the program is considered correct.
