The value of `num_len` is assigned the length of the string `num_str`, which is a string representation of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is also a non-negative string representation of an integer. The length of `num_str` will be the number of digits in `n`. 

For example, if `n` is 123, `num_str` will be '123' and `num_len` will be 3. 

Therefore, `num_len` is equal to the number of digits in `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.**
