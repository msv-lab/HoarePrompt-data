The code is using list comprehension to create a new list of lists. The outer list will contain 'n' number of sublists. Each sublist is created by slicing the original list 'lst' with a step size of 'n', starting from a different index 'i' for each sublist. 

Since 'n' is a positive integer, the step size will be a positive integer. The list 'lst' can be of any length and contain any type of elements.

The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist is a slice of the original list 'lst' with a step size of 'n', and there are 'n' number of such sublists.

Output State: **The program returns a list of 'n' sublists, where each sublist is a slice of 'lst' with a step size of 'n', 'n' is a positive integer, and 'lst' is the original list**
