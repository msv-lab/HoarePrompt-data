Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the program appears to be correct.

The problem description asks for a function that splits a list into sublists, each containing every nth element. The original assessment accurately describes how the list comprehension in the code achieves this.

The annotated version of the code also confirms that the program returns a list of 'n' sublists, where each sublist is a slice of the original list with a step size of 'n'. This aligns with the problem description and the original assessment.

The code handles cases where the list size is a multiple of n, as well as cases where it is not. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n = 3`, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`, which is the expected output.

The code also handles edge cases, such as when n is 1 (in which case the function returns the original list as a single sublist) or when n is greater than the list size (in which case the function returns a list of sublists, each containing a single element from the original list).

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
