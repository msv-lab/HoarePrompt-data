Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks for a function that splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. The provided code uses list slicing with a step size of `n`, which effectively groups every nth element together. However, the code does not handle non-integer or non-positive step sizes correctly.

For example, if the input is `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0)`, the function should either raise an error or return an empty list, but instead, it will throw an error when trying to create the list slices.

Additionally, the function does not check if the input `n` is an integer, so if `n` is a float, the function will also throw an error when trying to create the list slices.

Another case where the function does not work correctly is when the input list is empty and `n` is a negative integer, the function will return an empty list, which might or might not be the expected behavior.

To fix these issues, the function should add error handling to check for non-integer and non-positive step sizes, and handle these cases accordingly. It should also consider adding a check for an empty input list and handle this case according to the problem description. 

Here is an example of how the function could be modified to handle these cases:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```
