Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The code correctly implements the described functionality of splitting a list into sublists at every nth element. The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates sublists by iterating over the input list `lst` with a step size of `n`, starting from each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list and a positive integer and returns a list of sublists with the specified step size. The hints also mention that the function may return empty sublists if the list is empty or the step size exceeds the list length, which is consistent with the behavior of the code.

However, the output hints also mention that the function may not handle non-integer or non-positive step sizes correctly, which could be considered a limitation of the code. Nevertheless, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not necessarily affect the correctness of the code for the specified problem description.

Therefore, based on the information available, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints.

Final: **True**
