The original assessment is "None", which implies that no initial evaluation of the program's correctness was made. 

The problem description requires a function that takes a list and an integer n, and splits the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses list comprehension to create a list of sublists. Each sublist is a slice of the original list with a step size of `n`, starting from index `i` for `i` in range `n`.

The annotated code explains the state of the program before the function call, the return value of the function, and the overall behavior of the function.

Based on the problem description and the annotated code, the function `func_1` appears to correctly split the input list into sublists for every nth element.

The annotated code mentions that the function may not handle non-integer or non-positive step sizes correctly. However, the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid, and the function is designed to work with positive integer values of `n`.

Therefore, considering the problem description and the annotated code, the original assessment of "None" does not provide any information about the correctness of the program. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the function `func_1` correctly implements the required behavior.

Final: **True**
