You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program, `func_1(lst, n)`, uses list comprehension to create a new list of lists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list, starting from each of the first n indices. This effectively splits the list into n sublists, each containing every nth element.

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n = 3`, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`.

Upon reviewing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The list comprehension approach ensures that every nth element is correctly grouped into separate sublists, regardless of the input list size or the value of n. 

The code handles cases when the list size is a multiple of n, as well as cases when it is not. It also handles edge cases, such as when n is 1 (in which case the function returns the original list as a single sublist) or when n is greater than the list size (in which case the function returns a list of sublists, each containing a single element from the original list).

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and n is a positive integer.
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of 'n' sublists, where each sublist is a slice of 'lst' with a step size of 'n', 'n' is a positive integer, and 'lst' is the original list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list and a positive integer, and returns a list of sublists where each sublist is a slice of the original list with a specified step size, potentially returning empty sublists if the list is empty or the step size exceeds the list length, and may not handle non-integer or non-positive step sizes correctly

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
