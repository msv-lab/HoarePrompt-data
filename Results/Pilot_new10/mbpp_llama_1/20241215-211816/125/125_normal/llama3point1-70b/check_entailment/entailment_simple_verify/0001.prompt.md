You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it implements the described functionality: splitting a list into sublists at every nth element. The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates sublists by iterating over the input list `lst` with a step size of `n`, starting from each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

This code correctly handles the edge cases, such as:

- An empty input list: The function returns an empty list or a list of empty lists, depending on the value of `n`.
- A list with fewer than `n` elements: The function returns a list of sublists, each containing one or zero elements.
- A list with a length that is a multiple of `n`: The function returns a list of sublists, each containing `n` elements.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2)`, the function will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which is the expected output.

In general, this program works correctly for all possible inputs, including edge cases, and produces the desired output according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and n is a positive integer.
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of 'n' sublists, where each sublist is a slice of 'lst' with a step size of 'n', 'n' is a positive integer, and 'lst' is the original list


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
