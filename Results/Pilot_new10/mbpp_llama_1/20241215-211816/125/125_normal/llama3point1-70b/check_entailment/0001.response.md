Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it implements the described functionality: splitting a list into sublists at every nth element. The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates sublists by iterating over the input list `lst` with a step size of `n`, starting from each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

This code correctly handles the edge cases, such as:

- An empty input list: The function returns an empty list or a list of empty lists, depending on the value of `n`.
- A list with fewer than `n` elements: The function returns a list of sublists, each containing one or zero elements.
- A list with a length that is a multiple of `n`: The function returns a list of sublists, each containing `n` elements.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2)`, the function will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which is the expected output.

In general, this program works correctly for all possible inputs, including edge cases, and produces the desired output according to the problem description.
