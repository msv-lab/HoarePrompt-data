Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code originally looks correct. The function takes in a list `lst` and an integer `n` and splits the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. 

The provided code uses list comprehension to create a list of sublists. The expression `lst[i::n]` generates a slice of the original list starting from index `i` and stepping by `n`. The outer list comprehension iterates over the range of `n`, effectively creating `n` sublists.

This approach correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. For example, if `lst` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n` is `2`, the function will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`. If the list is empty, the function will return a list of empty sublists, and if the step size exceeds the list length, the function will return sublists with the corresponding elements.

The output hints agree with the code and do not indicate any potential issues with the function's behavior. The function handles non-integer or non-positive step sizes correctly by not accepting them, as the `range` function and list slicing require integer indices.

However, it is essential to note that this function does not include any error checking for the input parameters. It assumes that `lst` is a list and `n` is a positive integer. If these assumptions are not met, the function's behavior may not be as expected.

Despite this, the function correctly implements the problem description for every potential case, considering the provided constraints and assumptions. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
