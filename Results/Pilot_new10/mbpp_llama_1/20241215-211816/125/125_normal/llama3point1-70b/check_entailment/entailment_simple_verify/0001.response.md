The problem description asks for a function that splits a list into sublists at every nth element. The original assessment claims that the provided code correctly implements this functionality. 

However, upon closer examination of the code, we can see that it actually groups every nth element from the list into separate sublists, rather than splitting the list at every nth element. 

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2)`, the function will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which is not the expected output if we were splitting the list at every nth element. The expected output would be `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`.

Given this discrepancy, the original assessment appears to be inaccurate. The annotated version of the code provides further insight into the program's behavior, confirming that it returns a list of 'n' sublists, where each sublist is a slice of the original list with a step size of 'n'. This behavior does not align with the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program does not correctly implement the described functionality.

Final: **False**
