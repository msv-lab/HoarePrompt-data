The original assessment concludes that the function `func_1` is correct based on the problem description. Upon reviewing the code, the problem description, and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment. The function correctly splits the input list into sublists, where every nth element from the original list is placed in the same sublist. The function handles various edge cases, including lists of varying lengths relative to `n`, and assumes `n` is a positive integer. 

The output hints also support the original assessment by stating that the function handles edge cases but assumes `n` is a positive integer. This assumption is reasonable given the problem description, which implies that `n` should be a positive integer.

The reason I believe the original assessment is accurate is that the function's logic is sound, and it correctly distributes elements from the input list into sublists based on their position. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for different input cases.

Final: **True**
