The code `result[i % n].append(element)` appends the `element` to the list at index `i % n` in the `result` list. Since `i` is 0, `i % n` is 0. So, the `element` is appended to the first list in `result`. 

The value of `result` was a list of `n` empty lists. After the code is executed, `result` becomes a list where the first inner list contains the `element`, and the other inner lists remain empty.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list where the first inner list contains the first element of `lst` and the other inner lists are empty, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` lists where the first inner list is `[lst[0]]` and the other inner lists are empty, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in `lst`**
