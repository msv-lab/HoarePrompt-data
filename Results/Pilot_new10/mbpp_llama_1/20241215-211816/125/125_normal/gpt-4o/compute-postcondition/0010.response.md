To analyze the given function `func_1`, let's break down what it does step by step:

1. **Accepts Parameters**: The function accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. Based on the annotations and the context, `lst` is expected to be a list, and `n` is expected to be a positive integer.

2. **Functionality**: Inside the function, a list of `n` empty lists is created. This list is named `result`. Then, the function iterates over each element in `lst`. For each element, it calculates `i % n`, where `i` is the index of the current element in `lst`. The element is then appended to the list at the index `i % n` in `result`.

3. **Return Value**: After all elements from `lst` have been distributed among the lists in `result`, the function returns `result`.

4. **Round-Robin Distribution**: The key aspect of this function is the round-robin distribution of elements from `lst` to the lists in `result`. This means the first element of `lst` goes to the first list in `result`, the second element goes to the second list, and so on, until the `n`th list. Then, the pattern repeats, and the `(n+1)`th element goes back to the first list, and so forth.

5. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - **Empty List**: If `lst` is an empty list, `result` will still be returned, but it will contain `n` empty lists. This behavior is consistent with the round-robin distribution logic, where there are simply no elements to distribute.
   - **List Length Less Than `n`**: If the length of `lst` is less than `n`, some lists in `result` will remain empty after distribution. This is because there are not enough elements in `lst` to fill all lists in `result`.
   - **List Length Greater Than or Equal to `n`**: If the length of `lst` is greater than or equal to `n`, the round-robin distribution ensures that elements are evenly distributed among the lists in `result`, with the potential for some lists to have one more element than others if the length of `lst` is not perfectly divisible by `n`.
   - **`n` Equals 1**: If `n` equals 1, all elements from `lst` will be appended to the single list in `result`, effectively returning a list containing one list which is a copy of `lst`.
   - **`n` Equals 0 or Negative**: The function does not include checks for `n` being 0 or negative. In such cases, the function would fail when trying to create the list `result` with `n` empty lists, as the number of lists to create would be invalid. However, based on the provided code, `n` is expected to be a positive integer.

6. **Conclusion**: The functionality of `func_1` is to distribute elements from a given list `lst` into a specified number `n` of lists in a round-robin manner. The function returns a list of `n` lists, where each list contains elements distributed from `lst`. It handles cases where `lst` is empty, longer, or shorter than `n`, but it does not explicitly handle cases where `n` might be 0 or negative, which would lead to errors in the current implementation.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists where elements from `lst` are distributed in a round-robin manner. It handles various edge cases, including empty lists and lists of varying lengths relative to `n`, but assumes `n` is a positive integer and does not explicitly handle cases where `n` might be 0 or negative. **
