To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to compare what the problem description asks for with what the annotated program does.

The problem description requires a function that gets the first element of each sublist from a given list of lists.

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (`sublists`) as input and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in `sublists`. The function uses a list comprehension to achieve this:

```python
return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

However, the additional comments in the annotated program provide more details about the expected behavior of the function, such as:

- It returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist.
- It returns an empty list if the input list is empty.
- It raises an exception if the input list contains empty sublists or non-list elements.

The problem description does not explicitly mention raising an exception for empty sublists or non-list elements, but it does imply that the function should operate on sublists that have at least one element.

Upon closer inspection, we notice the following:

1. ** Handling of Empty Input List**: The function will correctly return an empty list if the input list is empty because attempting to iterate over an empty list in the list comprehension will simply result in an empty list.

2. **Handling of Non-Empty Sublists**: For non-empty sublists, the function will correctly extract the first element of each sublist.

3. **Handling of Empty Sublists**: If the input list contains empty sublists, the function will raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access the first element of an empty sublist (`sublist[0]`). This behavior is consistent with one part of the annotated comments but does not explicitly follow the problem description's simple request without considering the additional comments.

4. **Handling of Non-List Elements**: If the input list contains non-list elements, the function will raise a `TypeError` when it tries to access an element of a non-list object as if it were a list (`sublist[0]`).

Given the above points and considering the original problem description and the additional annotations, the program does more than what the basic problem description requests. It not only retrieves the first element of each sublist but also implies specific error handling (through exceptions) for certain edge cases not explicitly mentioned in the basic problem description.

However, strictly following the basic problem description without the additional annotations, the function does what is asked (getting the first element of each sublist) but will fail (by raising exceptions) in cases not covered by the basic description, such as empty sublists or non-list elements.

Since the function does meet the basic requirement of the problem description for the case of non-empty sublists and handles the edge cases (empty input list, empty sublists, and non-list elements) in a way that is reasonable and actually provides more functionality than the bare minimum requested, but considering the problem description alone without additional context or requirements:

Correctness: **False** 

The reason for this assessment is that the program does not gracefully handle the cases of empty sublists or non-list elements as might be implied by a straightforward interpretation of the problem description, which does not specify what should happen in these cases. The function's behavior in these edge cases (raising exceptions) is reasonable and documented in the comments, but the original problem description does not provide enough detail to consider the program's behavior as entirely correct without considering these additional details.
