To verify the correctness of the program, we need to analyze if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python function to get the first element of each sublist from a given list of lists.

The annotated program provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (`sublists`) as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. This is achieved through a list comprehension: `[sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]`.

Let's break down why this program is correct based on the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The function iterates over each sublist in the input list `sublists` and extracts the first element (`sublist[0]`) of each sublist. This directly addresses the requirement to get the first element of each sublist.

2. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**: Although not explicitly mentioned, the function assumes that all sublists are non-empty. If any sublist is empty, attempting to access `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. However, based on the problem description alone, it's reasonable to assume that the input will always contain non-empty sublists or that the function's behavior in the face of empty sublists is undefined.

3. **Output**: The function returns a list of the first elements of each sublist, which aligns with the expected output format described in the problem.

Given the information provided in the problem description and the functionality of the annotated program, the program is correct because it does what the problem description asks for, under the assumption that all sublists are non-empty.

However, it's worth noting that the program does not handle the case where the input list itself is empty or where any of the sublists are empty. In a more robust implementation, you might want to add checks for these conditions to ensure the function behaves as expected or raises meaningful errors.

Correctness: **True**
