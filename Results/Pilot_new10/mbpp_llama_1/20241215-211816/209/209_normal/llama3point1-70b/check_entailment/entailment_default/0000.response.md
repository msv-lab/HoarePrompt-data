Correctness: **False**.

The code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Although the function uses a list comprehension to extract the first element of each sublist, it does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. If an empty sublist is encountered, the function will raise an exception. 

For example, if we have a list of lists `sublists = [[1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5, 6]]`, the function will raise an exception when it tries to access the first element of the second sublist (`sublist[0]`).

The output hints agree with this analysis, as they state that the function raises an exception if the input list contains empty sublists. 

This behavior does not align with the problem description, which simply asks for the first element of each sublist without specifying how to handle empty sublists. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**. 

A corrected version of the function could be:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists if sublist]
``` 

This version of the function uses the fact that empty lists are considered False in a boolean context, so the `if sublist` condition ensures that only non-empty sublists are processed.
