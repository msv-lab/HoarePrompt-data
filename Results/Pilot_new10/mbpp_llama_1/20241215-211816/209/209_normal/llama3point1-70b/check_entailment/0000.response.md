Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to extract the first element of each sublist. This approach is correct and will work for all potential cases. Here's why:

* The function takes a list of sublists `sublists` as input.
* The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]` iterates over each sublist and extracts the first element using `sublist[0]`.
* The resulting list of first elements is then returned by the function.

This implementation is correct for several reasons:

* It handles empty sublists by raising an `IndexError`, which is the expected behavior when trying to access an element at index 0 of an empty list.
* It handles nested sublists of varying lengths correctly, as it only extracts the first element of each sublist.
* It handles the case where the input list is empty, returning an empty list as expected.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct. 

However, it is worth noting that the function does not include any error checking to handle cases where the input is not a list of lists, or where the sublists are not lists. If such error checking is desired, the function could be modified to include checks and handle these cases accordingly. But based on the problem description provided, the function is correct.
