Correctness: **False**

The provided Python function `func_1` does not fully meet the requirements as hinted by the problem description and output hints. Specifically, the function does not handle cases where the input list contains empty sublists or non-list elements as described in the output hints. 

For instance, if the input is `[[], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]`, the function should ideally raise an exception or handle the empty sublist in a manner consistent with the output hints, but it does not. Instead, it will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element of an empty sublist (`sublist[0]` for an empty sublist). 

Additionally, if the input contains non-list elements, such as `[1, [2, 3], [4, 5]]`, the function will also fail with a `TypeError` because it tries to access the first element of each item in the list as if each item were a list (`sublist[0]` for a non-list element).

To align with the output hints and the problem description, the function should be modified to explicitly handle these edge cases, either by skipping empty sublists, raising exceptions for invalid input types, or implementing another strategy that meets the specified requirements. 

For example, a corrected version could look like this:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    if not all(isinstance(sublist, list) for sublist in sublists):
        raise ValueError("Input list must only contain lists.")
    result = []
    for sublist in sublists:
        if sublist:  # Check if sublist is not empty
            result.append(sublist[0])
        else:
            raise ValueError("Input list cannot contain empty sublists.")
    return result
```

This version ensures that the function handles the specified edge cases and aligns with the output hints provided.
