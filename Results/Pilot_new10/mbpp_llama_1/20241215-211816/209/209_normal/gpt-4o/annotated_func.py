#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `lst` and returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist in `lst`, or throws an error if `lst` contains non-list items or empty sublists, and returns an empty list if `lst` is empty
