You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]
assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]

def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`lst`) as input and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist. This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over each sublist in `lst` and extracts the first element using `sublist[0]`.

The function appears to be correct for all potential cases. It handles lists of varying lengths, including empty lists, and sublists of different sizes. The unit tests provided also support this conclusion, as they demonstrate the function's ability to extract the first elements from sublists with different numbers of elements.

Additionally, the function does not contain any logic that could potentially lead to incorrect results. The list comprehension is straightforward and does not rely on any conditional statements or loops that could introduce errors. The function simply returns a list of the first elements of each sublist, which aligns with the problem description.

Overall, since I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists `lst` and returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist in `lst`, or throws an error if `lst` contains non-list items or empty sublists, and returns an empty list if `lst` is empty

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
