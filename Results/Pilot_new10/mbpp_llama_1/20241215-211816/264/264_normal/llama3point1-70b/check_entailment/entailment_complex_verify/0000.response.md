The original assessment states that the program is correct, and upon reviewing the problem description and the provided code, I agree with this assessment. The function `func_1(deg)` correctly implements the mathematical formula to convert degrees to radians, which is `radians = degrees * math.pi / 180`. This formula is a standard conversion formula used in mathematics and physics.

The annotated version of the code confirms this, stating that the program returns the radians equivalent of the input degree, which is a real number. The annotation also mentions that the function assumes the input is a numeric value, but since we assume the user will always provide a valid input, this is not a concern.

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies the function as a correct implementation of the degree-to-radians conversion formula. The assessment also provides examples of the function's correctness, such as converting 90 degrees to `math.pi / 2` radians and -45 degrees to `-math.pi / 4` radians.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations.

Final: **True**
