The original assessment states that the Correctness is **True**. This assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(deg)` correctly implements the mathematical formula to convert degrees to radians, and it handles all real numbers, including positive and negative angles, as well as zero.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts a real number representing degrees, converts it to radians using the correct formula, and returns the result. The hints also mention that the function assumes the input is a numeric value and does not include error handling for non-numeric inputs. However, as stated in the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is accurate. The program correctly implements the conversion formula and handles all valid inputs as expected.

Final: **True**
