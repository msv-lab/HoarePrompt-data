Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to correctly implement the conversion of degrees to radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`. 

The output hints confirm that the function accepts a real number representing degrees, converts it to radians, and returns the result. Although the output hints mention that the function does not include error handling for non-numeric inputs, this is not a concern since we assume the input will be valid.

The original assessment is None, which implies that there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. However, after reviewing the code and output hints, it becomes clear that the program is correct based on the problem description.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
