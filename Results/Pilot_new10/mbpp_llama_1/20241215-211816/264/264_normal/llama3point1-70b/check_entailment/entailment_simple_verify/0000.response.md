To determine the final correctness of the program, we need to analyze the problem description, the original program, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description requires writing a function to convert degrees to radians. The provided program defines a function `func_1(deg)` that takes an angle in degrees as input and returns its equivalent in radians.

The formula to convert degrees to radians is `radians = degrees * Ï€ / 180`, which is correctly implemented in the provided program.

The annotated code provides the state of the program before the function call and after the function execution. It correctly states that the program returns the radians equivalent of the input degree, which is a real number.

Since the original assessment is "None", it does not provide any information about the correctness of the program.

However, based on the problem description, the original program, and the annotated code, the program is correct. The formula used to convert degrees to radians is correct, and the annotated code confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Final: **True**
