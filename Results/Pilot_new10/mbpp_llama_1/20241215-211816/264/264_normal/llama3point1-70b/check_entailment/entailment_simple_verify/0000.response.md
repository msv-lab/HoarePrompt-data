Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the original assessment was accurate. The function `func_1(deg)` correctly implements the mathematical formula to convert degrees to radians. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function takes a real number as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians, which is also a real number.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function handles all possible inputs correctly, including positive and negative angles, as well as zero. The example use cases provided in the original assessment, such as `func_1(90)` and `func_1(-45)`, demonstrate that the function produces the correct output.

The annotated version of the code does not introduce any new information that would suggest the original assessment was inaccurate. The state of the program before the function call is correctly described as `deg` being a real number, and the return statement correctly returns the radians equivalent of the input degree.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment was accurate, and I do not see any reason to change it.

Final: **True**
