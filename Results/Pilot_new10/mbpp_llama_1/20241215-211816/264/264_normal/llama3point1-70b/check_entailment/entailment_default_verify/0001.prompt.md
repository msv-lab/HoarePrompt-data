You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly converts degrees to radians. The function `func_1` takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians. The conversion formula used in the function, `deg * math.pi / 180`, is mathematically accurate and widely accepted.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Positive degree values: The function correctly converts positive degree values to radians. For example, `func_1(90)` returns `1.5707963267948966`, which is the correct radian equivalent of 90 degrees.
- Negative degree values: The function also correctly handles negative degree values. For instance, `func_1(-45)` returns `-0.7853981633974483`, which is the correct radian equivalent of -45 degrees.
- Zero degree value: The function correctly handles the zero degree case, returning `0.0` when `func_1(0)` is called.
- Non-integer degree values: The function is capable of handling non-integer degree values. For example, `func_1(45.5)` returns `0.7945298530717959`, which is the correct radian equivalent of 45.5 degrees.

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a real number representing degrees, converts it to radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`, and returns the result. It assumes the input is a numeric value and does not include error handling for non-numeric inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
