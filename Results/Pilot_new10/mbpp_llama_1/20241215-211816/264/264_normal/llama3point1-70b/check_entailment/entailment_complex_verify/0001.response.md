The original assessment and the annotated version of the code both indicate that the program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`. The original assessment thoroughly checks various cases, including positive, negative, and zero degree values, as well as non-integer degree values. The annotated code provides additional confirmation by describing the state of the program before and after the function call, showing that it correctly handles the conversion.

The annotated code mentions that the function assumes the input is a numeric value and does not include error handling for non-numeric inputs. However, the problem statement and the assumptions provided with the annotated code both specify that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the lack of error handling for non-numeric inputs does not affect the correctness of the program under the given assumptions.

Given that the original assessment thoroughly checks the correctness of the program and the annotated code confirms the correct functionality, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
