Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a real number `degrees` as input and returns its equivalent in radians as a real number. The conversion from degrees to radians is performed by multiplying the input `degrees` with the constant `math.pi / 180`, which is the correct conversion factor.

Here is why the program is correct:

1. **Correct Conversion Factor**: The program uses the correct conversion factor `math.pi / 180` to convert degrees to radians. This ensures that the output of the function is the radian equivalent of the input degrees.

2. **Consistency with Problem Description**: The function does exactly what the problem description asks for: it accepts a real number representing degrees and returns its equivalent in radians as a real number.

3. **Correct Results**: The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate that the function returns the correct results for specific inputs. These tests cover different cases (90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees) and verify that the function produces the expected radian values.

The only potential issue with the program is the lack of input validation or error checking. However, the problem description does not require this, and the function behaves as specified for all real number inputs.

In conclusion, the program is correct because it accurately implements the conversion from degrees to radians, produces the expected results for different inputs, and follows the problem description.
