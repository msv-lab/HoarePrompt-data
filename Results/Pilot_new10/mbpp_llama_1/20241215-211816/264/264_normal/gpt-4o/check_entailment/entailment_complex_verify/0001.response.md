The original assessment is "None", which means that no initial assessment of the program's correctness was provided. 

After reviewing the problem description, the program, and the annotated version, we can determine the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires a function to convert degrees to radians. The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes an input `degrees` and returns the result of multiplying `degrees` by `math.pi / 180`. This is the correct mathematical formula to convert degrees to radians.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function accepts a real number `degrees` and returns its radian equivalent as a real number, which is consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the program, and the annotated version, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
