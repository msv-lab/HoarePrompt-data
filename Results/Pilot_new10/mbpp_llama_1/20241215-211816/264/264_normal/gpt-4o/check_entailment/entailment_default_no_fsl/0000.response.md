Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where the input is not a number. If the input is a string or any other non-numeric value, the function will throw an error. Additionally, it does not check for extremely large or small input values that may cause an overflow or underflow. 

For example, if the input is a string, the function will throw a TypeError: 
```python
func_1("90")
```
This will result in a TypeError because you cannot multiply a string by a float.

Another issue is that it does not handle cases where the input is NaN (Not a Number) or infinity. These are valid floating-point numbers, but they do not represent degrees and may cause the function to return incorrect results.

To fix these issues, the function should include input validation and error checking to handle these potential cases. For example, it could check if the input is a number and throw a ValueError if it is not:
```python
def func_1(degrees):
    if not isinstance(degrees, (int, float)):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a number")
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
```
