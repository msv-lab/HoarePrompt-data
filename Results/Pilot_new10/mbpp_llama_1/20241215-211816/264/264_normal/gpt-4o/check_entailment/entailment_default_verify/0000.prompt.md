You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966
assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976
assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953

def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes an angle in degrees as input and returns its equivalent value in radians. The function uses the mathematical formula `radians = degrees * (π / 180)`, which is the standard conversion formula from degrees to radians.

The `math.pi` constant is used to represent the value of π, ensuring a precise conversion. The function does not handle any specific edge cases or input validation, but for a simple conversion function, it seems sufficient.

The provided unit tests using `assert` statements demonstrate the function's correctness for a few example inputs. Since the conversion formula is well-established and the function implements it correctly, there is no obvious case where the program would not work as expected.

The function does not check for invalid input (e.g., negative values or non-numeric input), but based on the problem description, it appears to be a simple implementation focused on the conversion formula itself. Without additional constraints or expectations, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases where the input is a non-negative numeric value representing an angle in degrees.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a real number `degrees` and returns its radian equivalent as a real number by multiplying it with `math.pi / 180`, without performing any input validation or error checking

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
