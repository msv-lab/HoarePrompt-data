The original assessment seems accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula `radians = degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. The unit tests provided demonstrate the function's correctness for various positive degree values, and the function also correctly handles negative and non-integer degree values.

The output hints confirm that the function multiplies the input `degrees` by `math.pi / 180` to return its radian equivalent, which aligns with the correct formula for converting degrees to radians.

Given that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the lack of input validation or error checking in the function does not affect its correctness in terms of performing the intended conversion.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, the original assessment of **True** is accurate.

Final: **True**
