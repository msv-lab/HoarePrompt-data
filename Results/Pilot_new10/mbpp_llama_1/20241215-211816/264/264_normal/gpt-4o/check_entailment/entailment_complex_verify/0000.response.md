The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion formula from degrees to radians using the standard mathematical formula `radians = degrees * (π / 180)`. The `math.pi` constant is used to represent the value of π, ensuring a precise conversion.

The annotated version of the code confirms this, as it describes the state of the program and the function's behavior in a way that aligns with the conversion formula and the problem description. The annotations indicate that the function accepts a real number `degrees` and returns its radian equivalent as a real number, which is the expected behavior.

The assumption of valid input, as stated in the problem description, means that the lack of input validation or error checking in the function does not affect its correctness in this context.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the original assessment that the program is correct remains accurate.

Final: **True**
