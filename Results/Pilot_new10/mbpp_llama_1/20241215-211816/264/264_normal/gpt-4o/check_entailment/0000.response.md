Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes an angle in degrees as input and returns its equivalent value in radians. The function uses the mathematical formula `radians = degrees * (π / 180)`, which is the standard conversion formula from degrees to radians.

The `math.pi` constant is used to represent the value of π, ensuring a precise conversion. The function does not handle any specific edge cases or input validation, but for a simple conversion function, it seems sufficient.

The provided unit tests using `assert` statements demonstrate the function's correctness for a few example inputs. Since the conversion formula is well-established and the function implements it correctly, there is no obvious case where the program would not work as expected.

The function does not check for invalid input (e.g., negative values or non-numeric input), but based on the problem description, it appears to be a simple implementation focused on the conversion formula itself. Without additional constraints or expectations, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases where the input is a non-negative numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
