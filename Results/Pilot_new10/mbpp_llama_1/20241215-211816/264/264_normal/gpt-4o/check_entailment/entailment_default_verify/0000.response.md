Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the original assessment is None, which implies that it is neither accurate nor inaccurate. However, after analyzing the code and the output hints, I can make a determination about the program's correctness.

The problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians, which is a simple mathematical operation. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an input `degrees` and returns its radian equivalent by multiplying it with `math.pi / 180`. The output hints confirm that this is the intended functionality of the function.

The code correctly implements the conversion formula, and the provided unit tests (assert statements) demonstrate its correctness for specific input values (90, 60, and 120 degrees).

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the lack of input validation or error checking does not affect the program's correctness in this context.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
