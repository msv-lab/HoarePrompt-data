The original assessment states that the program is correct, and after reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I agree with this assessment. 

The problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians, which is a straightforward mathematical operation. The provided code implements this conversion using the standard formula `radians = degrees * (π / 180)`, where `math.pi` is used to represent the value of π. 

The output hints confirm that the function accepts a real number `degrees` and returns its radian equivalent as a real number by multiplying it with `math.pi / 180`, without performing any input validation or error checking. This matches the expectations based on the problem description.

One potential concern could be the lack of input validation, but since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a real number representing an angle in degrees), the program is still correct. The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for several example inputs.

Therefore, based on the information available, I conclude that the original assessment was accurate.

Final: **True**
