The original assessment is None, indicating that no initial evaluation of the program's correctness was provided. 

To assess the correctness of the program, we consider the problem description, which requires writing a function to convert degrees to radians. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an input `degrees` and returns the equivalent value in radians by multiplying `degrees` by `(math.pi / 180)`. 

The annotated version of the code supports this functionality, noting that the state of the program before the function call has `degrees` as a real number, and the function returns the radian equivalent of the input, which is also a real number. This aligns with the expected behavior for converting degrees to radians.

Given the problem description and the code provided, the function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the mathematical formula `radians = degrees * (π / 180)`, where `math.pi` is used to represent `π`. The assertions provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for specific inputs.

Therefore, based on the information available, the original lack of assessment does not affect the conclusion about the program's correctness. The annotated version reinforces the understanding of the program's functionality and its correctness in achieving the desired conversion.

Final: **True**
