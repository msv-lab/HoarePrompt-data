The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**. The program defines a function `func_1` that correctly implements the conversion formula from degrees to radians, which is a well-established mathematical formula. The function uses the `math.pi` constant to ensure a precise conversion.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment. It indicates that the program returns the radian equivalent of the input 'degrees', which is a real number, and that the state of the program right before the function call is that 'degrees' is a real number. This aligns with the problem description and the conversion formula.

The program does not handle invalid input, but as stated in the problem, we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the original assessment of the program's correctness remains accurate.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for a few example inputs, further supporting the original assessment.

Final: **True**
