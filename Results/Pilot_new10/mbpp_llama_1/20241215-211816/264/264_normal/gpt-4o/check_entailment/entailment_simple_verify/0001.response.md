To determine the final correctness of the program, we must analyze the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks to write a function to convert degrees to radians. The provided Python function `func_1` uses the mathematical formula `radians = degrees * (math.pi / 180)` to perform the conversion.

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct because it accurately converts degrees to radians for all real inputs, including positive, negative, and non-integer degree values. The unit tests provided demonstrate the function's correctness for specific degree values.

The annotated version of the code describes the state of the program before the function call as `degrees` being a real number and the return value as the radian equivalent of the input `degrees`, also a real number. This annotation aligns with the original assessment, indicating that the function is designed to handle all real numbers as input.

Based on the provided code, the mathematical formula used is correct for converting degrees to radians. The function is implemented correctly, and the unit tests demonstrate its correctness for various inputs.

Therefore, considering all the information, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment by confirming the program's ability to handle real numbers as input and produce the correct radian equivalents as output.

Final: **True**
