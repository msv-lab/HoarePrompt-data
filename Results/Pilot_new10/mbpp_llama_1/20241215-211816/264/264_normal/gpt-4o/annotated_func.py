#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a real number.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns the radian equivalent of the input 'degrees', which is a real number
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a real number `degrees` and returns its radian equivalent as a real number by multiplying it with `math.pi / 180`, without performing any input validation or error checking
