To determine the output state, let's consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

The initial state is that `degrees` is a real number. The Python code snippet is `return degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. This code converts the `degrees` from degrees to radians, as the conversion formula from degrees to radians is multiplying the degree value by Ï€/180.

Given that `degrees` can be any real number, the result of `degrees * (math.pi / 180)` will also be a real number, specifically the radian equivalent of the input `degrees`.

Output State: **The program returns the radian equivalent of the input 'degrees', which is a real number**
