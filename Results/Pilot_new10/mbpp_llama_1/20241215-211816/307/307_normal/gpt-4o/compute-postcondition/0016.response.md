The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is 3, so the new value of `k` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. The condition regarding the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` and `n` does not impact the change in `k` because the code `k += 1` is executed regardless of this condition. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 4, `triangular_number` is 6. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is equal to `n`, then the program would have returned `k` which was 3 before the increment, but this return condition is not executed in this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 4, `triangular_number` is 6**
