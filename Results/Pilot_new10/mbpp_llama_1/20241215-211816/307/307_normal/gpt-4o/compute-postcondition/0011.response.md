The code increments the value of `k` by 1. The initial value of `k` is 2, so the new value of `k` is 3. The values of `n` and `triangular_number` are not affected by the code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3, if the length of `triangular_number` as a string is equal to `n`, the program returns `k`, which is 3, otherwise, there is no effect on the variables**
