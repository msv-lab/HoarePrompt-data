To solve this, let's consider the initial state and the given code.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3.

Given Code:
```python
triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
```

Now, let's calculate the new value of `triangular_number` based on the value of `k`.

Given `k` is 3, we substitute `k` in the formula:
```python
triangular_number = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2
```

Calculating inside the parentheses first:
```python
triangular_number = 3 * 4 // 2
```

Then, multiplying:
```python
triangular_number = 12 // 2
```

Finally, dividing (which is integer division because of `//`):
```python
triangular_number = 6
```

So, the value of `triangular_number` changes to 6. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6**
