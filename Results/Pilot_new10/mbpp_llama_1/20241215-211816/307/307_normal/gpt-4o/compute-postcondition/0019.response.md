The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` for which the string representation of the `k`-th triangular number has a length of `n`. 

The annotations provided do not accurately reflect the functionality of the code. The code does not return only 1, 2, or 3 as stated in the annotations. Instead, it returns the smallest `k` for which the string representation of `k * (k + 1) // 2` has a length of `n`.

Upon examining the code, it is clear that it will return `k` as soon as it finds a triangular number whose string representation has a length of `n`. This means that the function will return different values of `k` depending on the input `n`.

One potential edge case to consider is when `n` is a non-positive integer or a non-integer. The code does not handle these cases explicitly, so it will either enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.

Another potential edge case is when `n` is a very large integer. In this case, the function may take a long time to return or may run out of memory.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` for which the string representation of the `k`-th triangular number has a length of `n`. It does not handle non-positive integers or non-integers explicitly and may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results for these inputs. **
