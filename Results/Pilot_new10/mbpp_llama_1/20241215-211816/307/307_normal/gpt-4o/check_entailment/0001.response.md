Correctness: **True**

The given Python function appears to correctly find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works as expected:

- It starts with `k = 1` and calculates the `k`-th triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. 
- It then checks if the length of the calculated triangular number (after converting it to a string) is equal to `n`.
- If it is, the function returns `k`, which represents the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.
- If it's not, `k` is incremented and the process repeats until a triangular number with `n` digits is found.

The provided unit tests (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) also seem to be correctly handled by the function. For example, the 4th triangular number is 10 (with 2 digits), the 14th triangular number is 105 (with 3 digits), and the 45th triangular number is 1035 (with 4 digits).

The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 (it will return 1, as the first triangular number, 1, has 1 digit). 

Overall, I couldn't find a case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description, which implies that the code is correct.
