The original assessment seems to be mostly accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The code correctly implements a function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. It starts with `k = 1` and increments `k` until it finds a triangular number with `n` digits, at which point it returns `k`. The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function.

However, the output hints point out a potential issue: the function may not handle non-positive integers or non-integers correctly, which could lead to incorrect results or an infinite loop. But since we assume the input will be valid (i.e., a positive integer), this does not affect the correctness of the function within the scope of the problem description.

Given that the problem description and the output hints both suggest that the input will be a positive integer, and the provided code correctly handles this case, the original assessment appears to be accurate. 

Final: **True**
