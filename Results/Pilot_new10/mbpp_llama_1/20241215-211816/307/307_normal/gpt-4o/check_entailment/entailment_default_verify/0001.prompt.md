You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function appears to correctly find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works as expected:

- It starts with `k = 1` and calculates the `k`-th triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. 
- It then checks if the length of the calculated triangular number (after converting it to a string) is equal to `n`.
- If it is, the function returns `k`, which represents the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.
- If it's not, `k` is incremented and the process repeats until a triangular number with `n` digits is found.

The provided unit tests (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) also seem to be correctly handled by the function. For example, the 4th triangular number is 10 (with 2 digits), the 14th triangular number is 105 (with 3 digits), and the 45th triangular number is 1035 (with 4 digits).

The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 (it will return 1, as the first triangular number, 1, has 1 digit). 

Overall, I couldn't find a case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description, which implies that the code is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` for which the string representation of the `k`-th triangular number has a length of `n`. It does not handle non-positive integers or non-integers explicitly and may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results for these inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
