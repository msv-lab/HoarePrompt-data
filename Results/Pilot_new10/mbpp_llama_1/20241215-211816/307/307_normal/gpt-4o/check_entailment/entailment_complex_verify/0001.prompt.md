You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function appears to correctly find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works as expected:

- It starts with `k = 1` and calculates the `k`-th triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. 
- It then checks if the length of the calculated triangular number (after converting it to a string) is equal to `n`.
- If it is, the function returns `k`, which represents the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.
- If it's not, `k` is incremented and the process repeats until a triangular number with `n` digits is found.

The provided unit tests (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) also seem to be correctly handled by the function. For example, the 4th triangular number is 10 (with 2 digits), the 14th triangular number is 105 (with 3 digits), and the 45th triangular number is 1035 (with 4 digits).

The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 (it will return 1, as the first triangular number, 1, has 1 digit). 

Overall, I couldn't find a case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description, which implies that the code is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 0.
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the original target length, `k` is the value for which the string representation of `k * (k + 1) // 2` has a length of `n`, and the loop has ended with `k` being returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` for which the string representation of the `k`-th triangular number has a length of `n`. It does not handle non-positive integers or non-integers explicitly and may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results for these inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
