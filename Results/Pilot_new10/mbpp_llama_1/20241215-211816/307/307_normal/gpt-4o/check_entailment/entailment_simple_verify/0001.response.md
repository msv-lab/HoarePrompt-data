The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem description and the provided code. The problem asks for the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. A triangular number is a number that can be represented as the sum of consecutive integers, starting from 1. The formula for the nth triangular number is `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the index `k` of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the code:

1. The function initializes a variable `k` to 1.
2. It enters an infinite loop, where it calculates the `k`-th triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
3. It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns `k`.
4. If not, it increments `k` by 1 and repeats the loop.

The annotated code provides additional information about the state of the program at different points. Before the function call, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. After the loop has been executed, `n` is the original target length, `k` is the value for which the string representation of `k * (k + 1) // 2` has a length of `n`, and the loop has ended with `k` being returned.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits and returns the correct value.

The unit tests provided also confirm the correctness of the program:
- `func_1(2)` returns 4, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with 2 digits (6).
- `func_1(3)` returns 14, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with 3 digits (105).
- `func_1(4)` returns 45, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with 4 digits (1035).

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
