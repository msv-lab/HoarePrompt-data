Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem description asks for the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The program uses a `while` loop to generate triangular numbers starting from `k = 1`.
2. In each iteration, it calculates the `k`-th triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
3. It then checks if the string representation of the triangular number has a length of `n`. If it does, the program returns the current value of `k`, which represents the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.
4. The program will continue to increment `k` and generate triangular numbers until it finds one with `n` digits, ensuring that it finds the smallest such triangular number.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the program for specific cases.

The key insight is that triangular numbers are monotonically increasing, meaning that as `k` increases, the corresponding triangular number also increases. This ensures that the program will find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, as it checks each triangular number in order.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, making it a correct solution to the problem.
