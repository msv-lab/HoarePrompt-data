According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will execute indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement. Since the loop condition is always `True`, no adjustments to the program state are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 1**
