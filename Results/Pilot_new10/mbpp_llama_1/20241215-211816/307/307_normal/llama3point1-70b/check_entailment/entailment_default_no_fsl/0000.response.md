Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately implements the problem description, which asks for the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. 

Here's why:

- The function `func_1(n)` starts with an index `idx` of 1 and enters a loop where it calculates the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
- It then checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns the current `idx`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits.
- If the length is less than `n`, `idx` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues until it finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits.
- This approach ensures that the function dynamically calculates the index without any predefined upper limit, as hinted in the output hints.
- The function handles all potential cases correctly because it will always find the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits, regardless of the value of `n`. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Therefore, the code correctly implements the problem description for every potential case.
