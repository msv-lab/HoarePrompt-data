Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement a function that finds the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. The function starts with `idx = 1` and increments it until the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number has a length of at least `n`. This approach ensures that the function returns the smallest index that satisfies the condition.

The use of a while loop allows the function to dynamically calculate the index without any predefined upper limit, which is suitable for finding triangular numbers with an arbitrary number of digits.

The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of the function's behavior. The hints state that the function returns the smallest index `idx` such that the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number has a length of at least `n`, which matches the problem description.

After reviewing the code and the output hints, it seems that the function correctly implements the required behavior and handles all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the code is True.
