Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:
1. It starts with an index `idx` of 1 and enters a while loop.
2. Inside the loop, it calculates the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
3. It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`.
4. If it is, the function returns the current `idx`, as this is the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits.
5. If not, `idx` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.

This approach is correct because triangular numbers increase monotonically, meaning that each subsequent triangular number is larger than the previous one. Therefore, as soon as the program finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits, it knows that this is the smallest such number and can return its index.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:
- It correctly calculates the `idx`-th triangular number.
- It checks the length of the string representation of the triangular number, which is equivalent to the number of digits.
- It returns the correct index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits.

Since the program works correctly for all potential cases, its correctness is **True**.
