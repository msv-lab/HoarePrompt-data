You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and works as expected for every potential case. It correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.

Here's why:

- The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of digits.
- It initializes a variable `idx` to 1, which will be used to calculate the triangular numbers.
- The function enters a while loop, where it calculates the `triangular_num` using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
- It checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns the current value of `idx`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.
- If not, it increments `idx` by 1 and repeats the loop.

This algorithm ensures that it finds the smallest triangular number with n digits, because it checks every triangular number in ascending order and stops as soon as it finds one with n digits.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. It handles all possible inputs, including edge cases like n = 1, and it always returns the correct index. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest index `idx` such that the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number has a length of at least `n`. The function dynamically calculates this index without any predefined upper limit.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
