The original assessment and the provided code align with the problem description. The code correctly implements a function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. The function starts with an index of 1, calculates the corresponding triangular number, and checks if its string representation has at least n digits. If it does, the function returns the current index; otherwise, it increments the index and repeats the process. This approach ensures that the function returns the smallest index that meets the condition, as triangular numbers increase monotonically.

The output hints confirm that the function works as expected, accepting a positive integer n and returning the smallest index idx such that the string representation of the idx-th triangular number has a length of at least n. The hints also mention that the function dynamically calculates this index without any predefined upper limit, which is consistent with the code's implementation.

Based on the provided information, the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the desired functionality, and the output hints support this conclusion. Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
