The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The code correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits by iterating over the triangular numbers in ascending order and stopping as soon as it finds one with n or more digits. 

The output hints also support this assessment, as they indicate that the function correctly returns the smallest index such that the string representation of the idx-th triangular number has a length of at least n.

One potential issue could be the efficiency of the algorithm for large inputs, as it needs to calculate every triangular number until it finds one with n digits. However, based on the problem description and the provided code, the program seems to be correct.

The program correctly handles the case where the input is a positive integer and does not need to handle cases where the input is not a positive integer or is invalid, as these cases are excluded by the problem description.

The code is well-structured and easy to understand, and the use of a while loop to iterate over the triangular numbers until the condition is met is a good approach.

Overall, the program seems to be correct based on the problem description and the provided code.

Final: **True**
