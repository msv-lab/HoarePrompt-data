To determine the correctness of the provided Python function `func_1(n)` based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze each component step by step.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is a number that can be represented as the sum of consecutive integers, starting from 1. The `n`-th triangular number can be calculated using the formula `Tn = n * (n + 1) / 2`.

2. **Provided Program**:
   ```python
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1
   ```
   This function starts with `idx = 1` and continuously calculates the `idx`-th triangular number. It checks if the string representation of this triangular number has a length of at least `n` digits. Once it finds such a triangular number, it returns the current `idx`.

3. **Original Assessment**: There is no original assessment provided.

4. **Output Hints**: The output hints clarify that the function should return the index `idx` such that the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number has a length of at least `n`. This matches the problem description and the functionality implemented in the provided code.

Given the analysis above, the provided code seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem. It dynamically calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits without any predefined upper limit, as suggested by the output hints.

**Reasoning for Final Assessment**:
- The code correctly implements a loop to calculate triangular numbers sequentially.
- It checks the length of the string representation of each triangular number to determine if it meets the `n` digit criteria.
- The function returns the index of the first triangular number that has at least `n` digits, fulfilling the problem's requirements.

**Final: True**
