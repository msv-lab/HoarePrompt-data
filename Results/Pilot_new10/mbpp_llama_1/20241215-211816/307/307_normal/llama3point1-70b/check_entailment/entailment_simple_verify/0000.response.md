The original assessment is "None", which means there is no prior assessment to evaluate. To determine the final correctness of the program, let's examine the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates triangular numbers and checks their length.

The annotated version of the code provides additional information about the state of the program at different points. Before the function call, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. After the loop, the function returns the smallest `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number is greater than or equal to the original value of `n`.

Based on the problem description and the annotated version, the code appears to be correct. The function iterates over triangular numbers, checks their length, and returns the index of the first triangular number with at least `n` digits.

Therefore, the final assessment is that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
