You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and works as expected for every potential case. It correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.

Here's why:

- The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of digits.
- It initializes a variable `idx` to 1, which will be used to calculate the triangular numbers.
- The function enters a while loop, where it calculates the `triangular_num` using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
- It checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns the current value of `idx`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.
- If not, it increments `idx` by 1 and repeats the loop.

This algorithm ensures that it finds the smallest triangular number with n digits, because it checks every triangular number in ascending order and stops as soon as it finds one with n digits.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. It handles all possible inputs, including edge cases like n = 1, and it always returns the correct index. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: The function returns the smallest `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number is greater than or equal to the original value of `n`. The value of `idx` is the same as the returned value. The original value of `n` remains unchanged.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
