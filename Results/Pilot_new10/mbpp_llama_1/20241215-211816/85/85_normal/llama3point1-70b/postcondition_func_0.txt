The function accepts a list of integers, returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list. It will raise an error if the list is empty, return 0 if the list contains a single element, and can handle lists with non-integer values or extremely large/small integers, returning the difference between the maximum and minimum values in these cases.
