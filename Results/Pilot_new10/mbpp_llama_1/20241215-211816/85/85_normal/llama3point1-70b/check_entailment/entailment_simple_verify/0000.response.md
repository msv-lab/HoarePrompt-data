To assess the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we must consider what the problem asks for and how the program addresses this request.

The problem asks for a Python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. This implies that the function should return the largest possible difference that can be obtained by subtracting any one element from another within the array.

The provided program is:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
```

The original assessment is "None", meaning there's no initial judgment on the program's correctness based on the given problem.

The annotated version of the code states:
1. The state of the program right before the function call is that `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
2. The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list `arr`.

Considering the problem description and the code, the program indeed calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which directly corresponds to the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. This is because the maximum difference is always achieved by subtracting the smallest element from the largest element in the array.

The annotated version supports this interpretation by clarifying the state of the input and the outcome of the function. Given that `arr` has at least two elements and is a list of integers, the function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in `arr` by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.

Since the problem description asks for the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, and the provided code calculates exactly that by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, the program is correct.

The reason for believing the original assessment was not provided ("None") is that there was no assessment to compare against or disagree with. Instead, the analysis directly evaluates the program against the problem description.

Final: **True**
