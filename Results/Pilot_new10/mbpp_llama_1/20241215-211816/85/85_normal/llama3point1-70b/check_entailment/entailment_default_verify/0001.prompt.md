You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function `func_1` takes an array as input, finds the maximum and minimum elements in the array using the built-in `max` and `min` functions, and then returns the difference between these two values. This difference is indeed the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array, as it represents the difference between the largest and smallest values.

This approach works correctly for all possible input arrays, including edge cases such as:

* Empty arrays are not considered, as the problem description does not specify how to handle this case. However, in Python, `max` and `min` will raise a `ValueError` if the input array is empty, which could be considered a valid response.
* Arrays with a single element, in which case the maximum difference is 0.
* Arrays with duplicate maximum or minimum values, in which case the difference is still calculated correctly.
* Arrays with negative numbers or zero, in which case the difference is still calculated correctly.

Overall, the program is a simple and efficient solution to the problem, and it works correctly for all possible input arrays.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list. It will raise an error if the list is empty, return 0 if the list contains a single element, and can handle lists with non-integer values or extremely large/small integers, returning the difference between the maximum and minimum values in these cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
