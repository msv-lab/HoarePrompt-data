To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to check if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to write a Python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes an array `arr` as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the array. This is achieved using the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions in Python, which return the largest and smallest items in an iterable (in this case, the array `arr`), respectively.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it indeed finds the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. This is due to the fact that the maximum difference between any two elements in an array will always be the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. 

Here is a step-by-step explanation of why this program is correct:
1. The `max()` function returns the largest element in the array.
2. The `min()` function returns the smallest element in the array.
3. The difference between the maximum and minimum elements is calculated by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element (`max(arr) - min(arr)`).
4. This difference is the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array, as any other pair of elements will have a smaller or equal difference.

Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem description. It will work correctly for all potential cases where the input array has at least two elements.
