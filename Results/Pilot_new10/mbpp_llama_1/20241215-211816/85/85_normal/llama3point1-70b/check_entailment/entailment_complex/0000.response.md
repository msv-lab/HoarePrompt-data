Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided function, `func_1`, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list `arr`, which is equivalent to finding the maximum difference between any two elements.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. **Handling lists with at least two elements**: The function calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list, which will always be the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the list.
2. **Handling lists with non-integer values**: The `max` and `min` functions in Python can handle lists with non-integer values. When encountering a non-integer value, the function will raise a TypeError, but since the problem description does not specify how to handle non-integer values, we can assume that the input list will only contain integers.
3. **Handling extremely large/small integers**: The `max` and `min` functions in Python can handle extremely large or small integers, so the function will still return the correct result in these cases.
4. **Error handling for empty lists or lists with a single element**: Although the problem description does not specify what to do with empty lists or lists with a single element, the function will raise an error for empty lists (because `min` and `max` cannot be called on an empty sequence) and return 0 for lists with a single element (because the maximum and minimum values will be the same).

However, it's worth noting that the function does not explicitly check for empty lists or lists with a single element, but this does not affect the correctness of the function according to the problem description. 

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.
