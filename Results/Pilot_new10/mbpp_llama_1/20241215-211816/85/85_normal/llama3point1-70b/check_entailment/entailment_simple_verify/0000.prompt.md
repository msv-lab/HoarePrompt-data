You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum value in the array from the maximum value. This approach is correct because it considers all possible pairs of elements in the array.

Here's why it works for every potential case:

1. **Empty array**: The program will throw an error if the input array is empty, because it tries to find the minimum and maximum values. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen in this case, and in Python, it's a common behavior to raise an error when operating on empty sequences. To handle this case, the program could be modified to return a specific value or raise a custom error.

2. **Single-element array**: If the array contains only one element, the function will return 0, which is the correct maximum difference between any two elements in this case (since there's only one element to compare with itself).

3. **Multi-element array**: For arrays with multiple elements, the function will correctly return the maximum difference between any two elements, because it considers the extreme values (minimum and maximum).

4. **Duplicate elements**: The function handles duplicate elements correctly, because it only considers the minimum and maximum values, regardless of how many times they appear.

5. **Negative numbers and zero**: The function also handles negative numbers and zero correctly, because the minimum and maximum functions in Python can handle these values.

6. **Float numbers**: The function can handle float numbers because Python's built-in min and max functions can handle float numbers.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. However, as mentioned earlier, it might be beneficial to add error checking for empty arrays to make the function more robust.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list `arr`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
