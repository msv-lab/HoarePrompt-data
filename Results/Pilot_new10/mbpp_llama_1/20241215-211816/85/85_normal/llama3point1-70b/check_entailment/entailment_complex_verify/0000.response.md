To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.

2. **Original Assessment**: None. This means there's no initial evaluation provided regarding the program's correctness.

3. **Program and Annotated Version**:
    - The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an array `arr` as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.
    - The annotated version explains the state of the program before the function call (a list of integers with at least two elements) and describes what the function does, including its behavior with different types of input.

Given the problem description and the annotated version of the program, it's clear that the function `func_1` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. This directly addresses the problem description's requirement to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

The annotated version provides insight into the program's behavior, including its handling of various input scenarios. However, it notes that the function will raise an error if the list is empty and return 0 if the list contains a single element. Since the problem assumes valid input (and thus excludes empty lists or lists with a single element), these scenarios do not directly impact the program's correctness in the context provided.

Considering all the information:

- The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
- The assumptions about valid input mitigate concerns about edge cases (like empty lists or lists with a single element).

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

Final: **True**
