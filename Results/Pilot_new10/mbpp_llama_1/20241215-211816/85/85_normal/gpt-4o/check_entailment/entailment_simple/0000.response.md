Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem description requires finding the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

In the provided Python function, it first finds the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions. Then it calculates the difference between these two values using `max_val - min_val` and returns this difference.

Since the difference between the maximum and minimum values in an array is always the maximum possible difference between any two elements, the function is correct.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why this approach works:

1. The `min()` function returns the smallest element in the array.
2. The `max()` function returns the largest element in the array.
3. The difference between the maximum and minimum values is the largest possible difference between any two elements in the array.

For example, given the array `[2, 1, 5, 3]`, the `min()` function returns `1` and the `max()` function returns `5`. The difference between these two values is `5 - 1 = 4`, which is indeed the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

This approach works for any array of integers with at least two elements and will always return the maximum difference between any two elements, meeting the problem description. 

The unit tests also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs:

- `func_1((2, 1, 5, 3))` returns `4`, which is the difference between `5` and `1`.
- `func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1))` returns `8`, which is the difference between `9` and `1`.
- `func_1((3, 2, 1))` returns `2`, which is the difference between `3` and `1`.
