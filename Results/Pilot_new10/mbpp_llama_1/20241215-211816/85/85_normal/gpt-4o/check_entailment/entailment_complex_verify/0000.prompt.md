You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is designed to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It achieves this by first finding the minimum and maximum values in the array, and then subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value to obtain the maximum difference.

Upon examining the code and the provided unit tests, it appears that the function works correctly for all potential cases. The function handles arrays with both positive and negative numbers, as well as arrays with duplicate values. The function also returns the correct result when the array contains only one or two elements.

The key steps in the function are:
1. Finding the minimum value in the array using the built-in `min()` function.
2. Finding the maximum value in the array using the built-in `max()` function.
3. Calculating the maximum difference between any two elements by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.
4. Returning the calculated maximum difference.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness in various scenarios:
- An array with both small and large values (e.g., `(2, 1, 5, 3)`).
- An array with a mix of small and large values in a different order (e.g., `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`).
- An array with values in descending order (e.g., `(3, 2, 1)`).

Overall, based on the examination of the code and the provided unit tests, it appears that the function correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list, and returns this difference. If the list is empty or contains a single element, the function will raise a ValueError. If the list contains non-integer values, the function will still calculate and return the difference, but the result may not be meaningful.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
