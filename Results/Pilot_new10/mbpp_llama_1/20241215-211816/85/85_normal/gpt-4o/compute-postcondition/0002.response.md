`max_diff` is assigned the value of `max_val` minus `min_val`. The value of `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`, and the value of `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`, so the value of `max_diff` is the difference between the largest and smallest integers in `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`, `max_diff` is equal to `max_val` - `min_val`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`, `max_diff` is equal to `max_val` - `min_val`**
