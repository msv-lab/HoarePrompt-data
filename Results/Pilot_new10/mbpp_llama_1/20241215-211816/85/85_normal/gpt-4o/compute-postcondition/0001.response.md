The code assigns the maximum value in the list `arr` to the variable `max_val`. The initial state states that `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements and `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`. 

Since `max_val` is assigned the maximum value in `arr` and `min_val` is still the smallest integer in `arr`, the output state will include the updated information about `max_val` and retain the information about `min_val` and `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`.**
