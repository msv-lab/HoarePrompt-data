You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(5, 12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(10, 15), 1570.7963267948965, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(19, 17), 6426.651371693521, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is a Python function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is `(1/3) * π * r^2 * h`, where `r` is the radius of the base and `h` is the height of the cone.

The provided code correctly implements this formula using the `math.pi` constant for π. The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume.

The unit tests provided using `assert` statements confirm that the function produces the expected results for different input values. 

There are no cases where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles different input values and calculates the volume of a cone according to the formula. 

Note that this function does not include any error checking to ensure that the input values are valid (e.g., non-negative numbers). However, based on the problem description, the function appears to be designed to calculate the volume of a cone given valid input values, and it does so correctly. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(5, 12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(10, 15), 1570.7963267948965, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(19, 17), 6426.651371693521, rel_tol=0.001)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cone, which is a non-negative real number calculated as 1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height, returning the result of the formula `1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height`, without validating that the inputs are non-negative real numbers, thus potentially returning incorrect volumes for negative inputs or throwing errors for non-numeric inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
