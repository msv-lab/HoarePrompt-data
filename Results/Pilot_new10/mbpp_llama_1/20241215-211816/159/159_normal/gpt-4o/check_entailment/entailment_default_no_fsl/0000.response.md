Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle cases where the inputs are negative or non-numeric. The volume of a cone is only defined for non-negative real numbers, and the formula will produce incorrect results if the radius or height is negative. Additionally, if the inputs are not numeric, the code will throw an error. 

For example, if we call `func_1(-5, 12)`, the function will return a result, but this result is not valid because a cone cannot have a negative radius. Similarly, if we call `func_1("five", 12)`, the function will throw an error because it cannot perform mathematical operations on strings. 

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**. To make the code correct, it should include input validation to ensure that the radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
