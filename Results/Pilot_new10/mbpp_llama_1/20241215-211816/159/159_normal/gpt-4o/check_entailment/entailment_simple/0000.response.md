Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the volume of a cone. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. The formula used in the `func_1` function is `1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, which is the standard formula for calculating the volume of a cone.
2. The program uses the `math` module to access the constant `pi`, ensuring accuracy in the calculation.
3. The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are both used in the calculation of the volume.
4. The function returns a non-negative real number, as required, since the volume of a cone cannot be negative.
5. The provided unit tests (assert statements) verify the correctness of the function for different input values of `radius` and `height`.

There are no obvious cases where the program would fail to meet the problem description. The function is well-defined, and the formula used is correct. The use of `math.isclose` in the unit tests ensures that the results are accurate to a small relative tolerance, accounting for any potential floating-point precision issues. 

Therefore, the program correctly implements the problem description, and its correctness can be confirmed.
