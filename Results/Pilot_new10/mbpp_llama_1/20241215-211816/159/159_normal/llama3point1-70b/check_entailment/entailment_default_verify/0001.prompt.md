You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program provided is a function to calculate the volume of a cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3) * π * r^2 * h, where r is the radius and h is the height. 

The given Python function `func_1(radius, height)` correctly implements this formula using the `math.pi` constant for π and the provided `radius` and `height` parameters. 

It correctly handles all potential cases, including:
- Positive values for radius and height: The function will return the correct volume.
- Zero values for radius or height: The function will return 0, which is the correct volume for a cone with a radius or height of 0.
- Negative values for radius or height: While these are not physically meaningful for the dimensions of a cone, the function will still return a value, although it may be negative. However, according to the standard formula for the volume of a cone, this is mathematically correct.

The function does not handle non-numeric inputs, as it will throw an error if the inputs are not numbers. However, this is not specified in the problem description as a requirement, and the function is correct in the context of calculating the volume of a cone for numeric inputs.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates the volume of a cone given the radius and height, returning the result of `1/3 * π * radius² * height`, without validating if the inputs are non-negative real numbers, and may produce incorrect results or throw errors for invalid inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
