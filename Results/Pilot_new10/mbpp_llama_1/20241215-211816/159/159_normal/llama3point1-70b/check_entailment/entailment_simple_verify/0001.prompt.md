You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program provided is a function to calculate the volume of a cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3) * π * r^2 * h, where r is the radius and h is the height. 

The given Python function `func_1(radius, height)` correctly implements this formula using the `math.pi` constant for π and the provided `radius` and `height` parameters. 

It correctly handles all potential cases, including:
- Positive values for radius and height: The function will return the correct volume.
- Zero values for radius or height: The function will return 0, which is the correct volume for a cone with a radius or height of 0.
- Negative values for radius or height: While these are not physically meaningful for the dimensions of a cone, the function will still return a value, although it may be negative. However, according to the standard formula for the volume of a cone, this is mathematically correct.

The function does not handle non-numeric inputs, as it will throw an error if the inputs are not numbers. However, this is not specified in the problem description as a requirement, and the function is correct in the context of calculating the volume of a cone for numeric inputs.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cone, which is a non-negative real number calculated as 1/3 * π * radius² * height, where radius and height are non-negative real numbers.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
