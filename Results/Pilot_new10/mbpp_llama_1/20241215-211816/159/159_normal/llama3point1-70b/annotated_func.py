#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cone, which is a non-negative real number calculated as 1/3 * π * radius² * height, where radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the volume of a cone given the radius and height, returning the result of `1/3 * π * radius² * height`, without validating if the inputs are non-negative real numbers, and may produce incorrect results or throw errors for invalid inputs.
