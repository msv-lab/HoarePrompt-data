To determine the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's analyze the provided annotated code and return postconditions step by step.

1. **Parameters and Return Value**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are described as non-negative real numbers. The function returns a single value, which is calculated as `1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height`.

2. **Calculation**: The calculation performed by the function is the formula for the volume of a cone, where `radius` is the radius of the cone's base, and `height` is the height of the cone. The formula is `1/3 * π * radius² * height`.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**: 
    - **Negative Inputs**: Although the annotations specify that `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers, the function does not include any checks to enforce this. Therefore, if negative values are passed for `radius` or `height`, the function will still calculate and return a value, which might not be physically meaningful in the context of calculating the volume of a cone.
    - **Zero Inputs**: If either `radius` or `height` is 0, the calculated volume will be 0, which is a valid result since a cone with a radius of 0 or a height of 0 does not have a volume.
    - **Non-numeric Inputs**: The function does not check if the inputs are numeric. If non-numeric values are passed for `radius` or `height`, the function will throw an error when attempting to perform the calculation.

4. **Functionality Summary**: Considering the actual code, the function calculates the volume of a cone using the formula `1/3 * π * radius² * height`, where `radius` and `height` are the inputs provided by the user. The function does not validate if the inputs are non-negative or numeric, which could lead to incorrect results or errors if the inputs do not meet these criteria.

Functionality: ** The function calculates the volume of a cone given the radius and height, returning the result of `1/3 * π * radius² * height`, without validating if the inputs are non-negative real numbers, and may produce incorrect results or throw errors for invalid inputs. **
