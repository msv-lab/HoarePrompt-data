Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `arr` and `target`, but it does not use the `target` parameter in the function body. The problem description does not mention a `target` parameter; it only asks to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when an empty array is passed to the function. In this case, the function will throw an error because it tries to access the length of the array (`len(arr)`) without checking if the array is empty. 

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input array has less than two elements. In such cases, the function should return a special value (e.g., `None` or a custom message) to indicate that it's not possible to find the minimum difference between two elements.

A correct implementation of the function should be:

```python
def min_diff(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return None
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```
