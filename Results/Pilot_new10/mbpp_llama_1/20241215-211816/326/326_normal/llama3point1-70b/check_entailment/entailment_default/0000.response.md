Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python function `func_1` sorts the input array `arr` in ascending order and then iterates over the sorted list to find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements. The function uses the variable `min_diff` to keep track of the minimum difference, initializing it to positive infinity and updating it whenever a smaller difference is found. 

The code correctly handles the case when `arr` has less than 2 elements, as in this case, it will return the initial value of `min_diff`, which is positive infinity.

The output hints agree with the code, and no potential case seems to be missed. The function works correctly for arrays with two or more elements, as well as for arrays with less than 2 elements, and it correctly returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list.

It's worth noting that the `target` parameter in the function seems to be unused, but it does not affect the correctness of the function with respect to the problem description. 

However, in a real-world scenario, this would likely be considered a code smell, and the unused parameter should be removed to improve the code's clarity and maintainability. 

In summary, the provided code correctly implements the function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, as per the problem description.
