You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` takes two parameters `arr` and `target`, but the `target` is not used anywhere in the function. The problem description only asks to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, without mentioning any target.

A case where this program does not work correctly is when an empty array is passed to the function, or when an array with only one element is passed. In these cases, the function should return an error or a special value indicating that the minimum difference cannot be calculated, but instead, it will throw an error when trying to access `arr[0]` or `arr[i + 1]`.

However, the main issue with this function is the presence of the `target` parameter which is not used. The function should be modified to only take the array as input, or the `target` should be used in the calculation of the minimum difference. 

Also, the function will fail if the input array is not a list of numbers. The function does not include any error checking to handle such cases. 

Here's a corrected version of the function that only takes the array as input and includes error checking:
```python
def find_min_diff(arr):
    if not isinstance(arr, list) or not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in arr):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a list of numbers")
    if len(arr) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must contain at least two elements")
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an unused integer `target`, sorts `arr` in ascending order, and returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list. If `arr` has less than 2 elements, it returns positive infinity.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
