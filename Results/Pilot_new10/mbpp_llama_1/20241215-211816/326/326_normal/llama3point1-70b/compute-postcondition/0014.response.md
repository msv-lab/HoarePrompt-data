Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 4 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 2, `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`. If `diff` is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `arr[3] - arr[2]`. Since there is no else part, if `diff` is not less than `min_diff`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
