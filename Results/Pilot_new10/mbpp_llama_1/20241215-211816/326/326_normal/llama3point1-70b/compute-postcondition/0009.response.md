The code `min_diff = diff` assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. 
Given that `diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, `min_diff` becomes `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 1, `diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, and `min_diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`.
Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 1, `diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, and `min_diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`.**
