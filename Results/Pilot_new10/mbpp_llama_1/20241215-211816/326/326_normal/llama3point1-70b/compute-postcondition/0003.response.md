To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the variables and their initial states.

- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `target` is an integer.
- `min_diff` is positive infinity.
- `i` is 0.

The code calculates the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the `arr` list, starting from the first element (`i = 0`).

Given that `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` are the first and second elements of the list, respectively. The difference between these two elements (`diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`) will be a non-negative integer, since `arr` is sorted and the absolute value function ensures the result is always non-negative.

The states of `arr`, `target`, `min_diff`, and `i` are not changed by this operation; only a new variable `diff` is introduced. 

Therefore, after executing the code, the state of the variables is:

- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements.
- `target` is an integer.
- `min_diff` is positive infinity.
- `i` is 0.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`, which equals `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`.**
