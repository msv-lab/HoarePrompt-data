#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(arr) and arr has at least two elements.
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: arr is a list of integers and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(arr) and arr has at least two elements, and n is greater than or equal to 2
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= n <= len(arr)`, `i` is `n-2`, `diff` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, and `min_diff` is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sublist `arr[0:n]`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 1 or less), `min_diff` remains positive infinity.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sublist arr[0:n], which is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns 0 if `n` is less than 2; otherwise, it returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted sublist `arr[0:n]`, which is a non-negative integer. Note that if `n` is greater than the length of `arr`, the function will still work correctly but `n` will be capped at the length of `arr` because the loop only iterates up to `n-1` and the array is sorted, thus the minimum difference will be calculated based on the entire array if `n` is greater than the array length.
