Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements in the problem description. It finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Array Sorting**: The program starts by sorting the input array in ascending order. This is necessary because finding the minimum difference between any two elements requires comparing adjacent elements.

2. **Initializing Minimum Difference**: The program initializes `min_diff` as `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. This ensures that the first difference calculated will be smaller than `min_diff`, allowing the program to capture the minimum difference correctly.

3. **Iterating Over Adjacent Elements**: The program iterates over the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. If the calculated difference is less than the current `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff`.

4. **Returning the Minimum Difference**: After iterating over all adjacent elements, the program returns `min_diff`, which now holds the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

*   **Array with Duplicate Elements**: If the array contains duplicate elements, the program will correctly identify the minimum difference as 0, since the difference between two identical elements is 0.
*   **Array with Negative Elements**: The program works correctly with arrays containing negative elements, as the sorting and difference calculation steps handle negative numbers without issues.
*   **Array with a Single Element**: Although the problem statement specifies that the array should have at least two elements, the program returns 0 when `n < 2`. This is not strictly in line with the problem description, but it is a reasonable interpretation, as there are no pairs of elements to compare in this case.

In summary, the provided Python program meets the requirements of the problem description and correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
