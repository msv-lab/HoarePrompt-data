You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1
assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1
assert func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4) == 4

def func_1(arr, n):
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's why:

1. The function first checks if the array has less than 2 elements. If so, it returns 0, which is correct because you cannot calculate the difference between elements if there's only one or no elements.

2. The function then sorts the array in ascending order. This is necessary because the minimum difference will always be between adjacent elements in a sorted array.

3. It initializes `min_diff` with infinity (`float('inf')`), which ensures that the first difference calculated will be smaller.

4. The function then iterates over the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. If it finds a difference that's smaller than the current `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff`.

5. Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

This approach handles all potential cases correctly:

- If the array is empty or has only one element, the function returns 0.
- If the array has multiple elements, the function correctly calculates the minimum difference between any two elements.
- The function works with both positive and negative numbers, as well as with duplicate elements.
- The time complexity of the function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, which is acceptable for this problem.

I couldn't find a single case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, so the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns 0 if `n` is less than 2; otherwise, it returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted sublist `arr[0:n]`, which is a non-negative integer. Note that if `n` is greater than the length of `arr`, the function will still work correctly but `n` will be capped at the length of `arr` because the loop only iterates up to `n-1` and the array is sorted, thus the minimum difference will be calculated based on the entire array if `n` is greater than the array length.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
