You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1
assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1
assert func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4) == 4

def func_1(arr, n):
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct for every potential case. It first checks if the length of the array is less than 2, in which case it returns 0, as there are not enough elements to find the minimum difference. It then sorts the array and initializes the minimum difference to infinity. It iterates through the array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements and updating the minimum difference if a smaller difference is found. This approach ensures that the program will find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

The provided assertions demonstrate the correct functionality of the program for various test cases. The program handles arrays of different lengths and with different elements, and it correctly calculates the minimum difference in each case.

To further verify the correctness of the program, we can consider the following scenarios:

- An array with duplicate elements: The program will correctly ignore the duplicate elements and find the minimum difference between the unique elements.
- An array with negative elements: The program will correctly handle negative elements and find the minimum difference.
- An array with a single element: The program will correctly return 0, as there are not enough elements to find the minimum difference.
- An empty array: While the program does not explicitly handle this case, it will correctly return 0, as the length of the array is less than 2.

In all these scenarios, the program behaves as expected, and no edge cases or potential issues were found. Therefore, the program appears to be correct for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns 0 if `n` is less than 2; otherwise, it returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted sublist `arr[0:n]`, which is a non-negative integer. Note that if `n` is greater than the length of `arr`, the function will still work correctly but `n` will be capped at the length of `arr` because the loop only iterates up to `n-1` and the array is sorted, thus the minimum difference will be calculated based on the entire array if `n` is greater than the array length.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
