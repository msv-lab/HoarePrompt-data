The code updates the value of `diff` by calculating the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the sorted list `arr`. Given that `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `i` is 1, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= n <= len(arr)`, the calculation `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]` essentially calculates the difference between the second element and the first element of `arr` since `i` is 1.

The value of `diff` becomes `arr[1 + 1] - arr[1]`, which simplifies to `arr[2] - arr[1]`. This means `diff` is updated to be the difference between the third element and the second element of `arr`. However, initially, `diff` was given as `arr[2] - arr[1]`, so this update actually does not change the value of `diff` based on the initial setup provided. The states of the other variables (`arr`, `n`, `i`, and `min_diff`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least two elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 1, `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, and `min_diff` remains as it was before this operation**
