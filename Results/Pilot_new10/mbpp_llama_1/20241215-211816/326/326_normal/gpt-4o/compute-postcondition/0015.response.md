The code calculates the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `diff`. Since `i` is 2, `arr[i + 1]` refers to the third element in the list (`arr[3]`) and `arr[i]` refers to the second element (`arr[2]`).

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least three elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `3 <= n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 2, `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`**
