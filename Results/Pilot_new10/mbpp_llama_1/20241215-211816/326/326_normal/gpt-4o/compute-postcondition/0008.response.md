`min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is less than the initial value of `min_diff` (positive infinity). The value of `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= n <= len(arr)`, `arr` has at least two elements, `min_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 0, `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`.
Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= n <= len(arr)`, `arr` has at least two elements, `min_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 0, `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`.**
