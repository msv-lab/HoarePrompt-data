The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(arr). The function returns either 0 or the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sublist arr[0:n]. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return either 0 or the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the specified sublist of `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns either 0 or the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sublist arr[0:n].**
