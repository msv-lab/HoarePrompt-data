Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least two elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 1, if `arr[2] - arr[1]` is less than the original `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, otherwise `min_diff` remains unchanged**
