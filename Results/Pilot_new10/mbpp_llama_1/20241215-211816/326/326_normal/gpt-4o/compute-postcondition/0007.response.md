Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` has at least two elements, initially `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, initially `diff` is calculated as `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The current value of `diff` is less than the current value of `min_diff`.**
