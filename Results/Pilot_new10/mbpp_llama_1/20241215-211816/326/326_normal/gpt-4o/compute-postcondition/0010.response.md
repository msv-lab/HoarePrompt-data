To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the current state.

Given loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= n <= len(arr)`.
- `arr` has at least two elements.
- `i` is 0.
- `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`.
- The state of `min_diff` depends on whether `arr[1] - arr[0]` is less than its initial value.

Since the loop iterates over the range `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 0, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 1.

The loop's ability to execute again does not directly depend on the states of `arr`, `min_diff`, or `diff`, but rather on the value of `n`. However, for the purpose of understanding the state at the start of the next iteration, we should consider how these variables might be used within the loop body (even though the loop body is omitted).

At the start of the next iteration:
- `arr` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order, with at least two elements.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer such that `2 <= n <= len(arr)`.
- `i` will be incremented to 1.
- Since `diff` is calculated based on the elements of `arr` and the current `i`, for the next iteration, `diff` would be calculated as `arr[2] - arr[1]`, assuming the loop body updates or uses `diff` in this manner.
- The state of `min_diff` could be updated in the loop body based on the comparison between `diff` and the current `min_diff`.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least two elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 1, `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, and `min_diff` may be updated based on the comparison with the new `diff` value**
