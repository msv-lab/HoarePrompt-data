## Correctness Analysis

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze its behavior against the provided problem description.

### Problem Description
The problem description asks to write a Python function that checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not.

### Program Analysis
The provided function, `func_1`, first sorts the input list `lst`. Then, it checks two conditions:
1. `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))`: This condition ensures that each number in the sorted list is one more than the previous number, which is a characteristic of consecutive numbers.
2. `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`: This condition ensures that all numbers in the list are unique.

### Correctness Evaluation
The function correctly checks for consecutive numbers by verifying that the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1, which implies the numbers are consecutive. Additionally, it checks for uniqueness by comparing the lengths of the original list and the set created from the list. A set in Python only contains unique elements, so if the lengths are equal, it means all numbers in the list are unique.

However, the problem description does not explicitly require the numbers to be unique or in ascending order; it only asks if the list contains consecutive numbers. The program's implementation, by sorting the list and checking for uniqueness, implies that the order does not matter initially, and it can handle lists with potentially unsorted or even unordered consecutive numbers. Yet, it inherently requires the list to contain unique elements because of the consecutive and uniqueness checks.

### Edge Cases and Considerations
- **Non-unique consecutive numbers**: The function will return `False` for lists that contain consecutive numbers but also have duplicates, because it checks for uniqueness.
- **Sorted vs. Unsorted Input**: The function sorts the input, so it can handle both sorted and unsorted lists.
- **Negative Numbers and Zero**: The function should handle negative numbers and zero correctly, as it only checks for the difference between consecutive numbers, which is not dependent on the sign of the numbers.

### Conclusion
The program is correct in the context that it checks if a list contains consecutive unique integers. However, the original problem statement does not explicitly mention the requirement for uniqueness. If the problem statement is interpreted strictly as asking for consecutive numbers without the uniqueness constraint, the program does not fully meet the requirements for all potential cases, especially those involving duplicate consecutive numbers.

Correctness: **False** 

Reason: The program incorrectly assumes that the numbers in the list must be unique to be considered consecutive. The problem description does not explicitly mention this requirement, which means the program does not meet the problem's specifications for cases where the list contains duplicate consecutive numbers.
