Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given list of integers contains consecutive numbers. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Sorting the list**: The function starts by sorting the input list `lst`. This is necessary because the problem statement doesn't specify that the input list must be sorted, and we need to check for consecutive numbers.

2. **Checking for consecutive numbers**: The function uses the `all()` function with a generator expression to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers in the sorted list is 1. This ensures that all numbers in the list are consecutive.

3. **Checking for unique numbers**: The function also checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of a set created from the list (`len(lst) == len(set(lst))`). This ensures that all numbers in the list are unique, which is a requirement for a list of consecutive numbers.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of cases that the code handles correctly, including:

* Empty lists
* Lists with a single element
* Lists with non-consecutive numbers
* Lists with non-unique numbers

The code handles these cases correctly because:

* An empty list will cause `all()` to return True (since there are no elements to check), but the `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` condition will also be True, so the function will return True. However, this might be considered a borderline case, as an empty list can be considered as not containing consecutive numbers. But since the function returns True, it implies that an empty list is considered as containing consecutive numbers. 
* A list with a single element will cause `all()` to return True (since there are no pairs of adjacent numbers to check), and the `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` condition will also be True, so the function will return True.
* A list with non-consecutive numbers will cause `all()` to return False, so the function will return False.
* A list with non-unique numbers will cause `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` to be False, so the function will return False.

Overall, the code correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive unique numbers, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
