Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it effectively checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function first sorts the input list `lst`. This ensures that the numbers are in ascending order, which is necessary for checking if they are consecutive.
2. The `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` part checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers in the sorted list is 1. If this condition is true for all pairs, it means that the numbers are consecutive.
3. The `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` part checks if all numbers in the list are unique. If the lengths of the list and the set (which removes duplicates) are equal, it means that all numbers are unique.

The function returns `True` if and only if both conditions (consecutive numbers and unique numbers) are met. This is in line with the problem description, which asks for a function that checks if a given list contains consecutive numbers or not.

Additionally, the function handles edge cases correctly, such as empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with non-consecutive or non-unique integers, as stated in the overall description of the function.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, and its correctness is **True**.
