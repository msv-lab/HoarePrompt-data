You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list to ensure that the numbers are in ascending order. Then, it uses the `all` function with a generator expression to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. This effectively checks if the numbers are consecutive.

The function also checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of a set created from the list. This is to ensure that there are no duplicate numbers in the list, because if there were duplicates, the numbers would not be consecutive.

This function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Lists with negative numbers
- Lists with a mix of positive and negative numbers
- Lists with duplicate numbers (which are correctly identified as not being consecutive)
- Lists with only one element (which are correctly identified as being consecutive)

For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True`, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5])` returns `False`, and `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4])` returns `False`. 

Overall, the function correctly checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the list 'lst' contains consecutive unique integers in ascending order, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, sorts it, and checks if the sorted list contains consecutive unique integers. It returns True if the list is sorted and contains consecutive unique integers, and False otherwise, including cases where the list is empty, contains a single element, or has non-consecutive or non-unique integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
