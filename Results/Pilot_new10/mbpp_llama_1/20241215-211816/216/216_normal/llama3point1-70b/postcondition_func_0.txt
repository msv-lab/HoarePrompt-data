The function accepts a list of integers, sorts it, and checks if the sorted list contains consecutive unique integers. It returns True if the list is sorted and contains consecutive unique integers, and False otherwise, including cases where the list is empty, contains a single element, or has non-consecutive or non-unique integers.
