#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the list 'lst' contains consecutive unique integers in ascending order, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, sorts it, and checks if the sorted list contains consecutive unique integers. It returns True if the list is sorted and contains consecutive unique integers, and False otherwise, including cases where the list is empty, contains a single element, or has non-consecutive or non-unique integers.
