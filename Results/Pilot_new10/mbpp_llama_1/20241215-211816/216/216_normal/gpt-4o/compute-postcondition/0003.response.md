The given code creates a new list called `lst_sorted` which is a sorted version of the original list `lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged as the `sorted()` function in Python returns a new sorted list and leaves the original list unaffected.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers equal to `lst`**
