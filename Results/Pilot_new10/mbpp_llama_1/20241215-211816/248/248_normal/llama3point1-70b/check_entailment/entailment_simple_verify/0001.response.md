To determine the final correctness of the program, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that converts a list to a tuple.
2. **Original Program**:
   ```python
   def func_1(input_list):
       return tuple(input_list)
   ```
3. **Original Assessment**: None
4. **Annotated Code**:
   ```python
   # State of the program right before the function call: input_list is a list.
   def func_1(input_list):
       return tuple(input_list)
       # The program returns a tuple that contains all elements from the input_list
   ```
   
Given the problem description, the function `func_1` is designed to take a list (`input_list`) and return a tuple containing all elements from the list. The Python built-in `tuple()` function does exactly this when given a list as its argument. Therefore, the provided program successfully accomplishes its intended task.

The annotations provided confirm the expected behavior:
- Before the function is called, `input_list` is indeed a list.
- The function returns a tuple created from `input_list`, which means it successfully converts the list to a tuple.

Since there's no original assessment to begin with, we don't need to evaluate its accuracy against the provided annotations and program. Instead, we can directly assess the program's correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

Given this information, the program correctly fulfills the requirement of converting a list to a tuple. Thus, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
