The original assessment states that the program is correct, and upon reviewing the provided code and annotations, I agree with this assessment. The function `func_1(input_list)` uses the built-in `tuple()` function in Python, which correctly converts a list to a tuple. The annotations provided also confirm this, stating that the program returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list.

The original assessment correctly notes that this function works for all potential cases, including lists containing different data types, nested lists, empty lists, and lists with duplicate elements. The annotations do not contradict this assessment and instead provide further confirmation that the function behaves as expected.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
