Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(input_list)` correctly converts a list to a tuple. It uses the built-in `tuple()` function in Python, which takes an iterable (in this case, a list) and returns a tuple containing all the elements from the iterable. This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Lists containing integers, floats, strings, or other data types.
- Lists containing nested lists or other tuples.
- Empty lists.
- Lists with duplicate elements.

For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3])` will return `(1, 2, 3)`, `func_1(["a", "b", "c"])` will return `("a", "b", "c")`, and `func_1([])` will return `()`. 

Since this function works as expected for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
