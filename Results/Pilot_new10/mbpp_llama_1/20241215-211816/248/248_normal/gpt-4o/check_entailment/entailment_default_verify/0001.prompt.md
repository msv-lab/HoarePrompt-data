You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a list to a tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]) == (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)
assert func_1([2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7]) == (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)
assert func_1([58, 44, 56]) == (58, 44, 56)

def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function in Python, which converts an iterable (like a list) into a tuple.

Here's why the function works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Type Conversion**: The `tuple()` function correctly converts a list of any size and containing any type of elements (integers, floats, strings, etc.) into a tuple.
2. **Handling Empty Lists**: Although not explicitly tested in the provided assertions, `func_1` also correctly handles an empty list `[]` by returning an empty tuple `()`.
3. **Handling Non-List Inputs**: If a non-list input is provided to `func_1`, it will still work as long as the input is an iterable (like a string, another tuple, etc.), because `tuple()` can convert any iterable into a tuple. However, if a non-iterable input (like an integer) is provided, the function will raise a `TypeError`. This behavior might or might not be considered correct based on the specific requirements of the problem description, but in the context of converting a list to a tuple, it is typically expected that the input will be a list or at least an iterable.
4. **Input Validation**: The function does not include any input validation to ensure that the input is indeed a list. Depending on the specific requirements of the problem, such validation might be necessary. However, based solely on the provided problem description ("Write a function to convert a list to a tuple"), the function behaves as expected for list inputs.

In summary, for the task of converting a list to a tuple as described, the function works correctly for all potential cases of list inputs, including lists of different lengths and containing different types of elements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an object, attempts to convert it into a tuple, and returns the resulting tuple. If the object is a list, the tuple will contain all elements from the list. If the object is not a list but is iterable (like a string), the tuple will contain its individual elements. If the object is not iterable, the function may raise an error.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
