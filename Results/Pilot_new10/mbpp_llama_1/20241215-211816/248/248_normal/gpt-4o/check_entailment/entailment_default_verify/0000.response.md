The original assessment is "None", indicating that no initial assessment was provided. 

To evaluate the correctness of the program, let's examine the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

The problem description asks for a function to convert a list to a tuple. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an input `lst` and returns `tuple(lst)`. This function will indeed convert a list to a tuple.

The output hints provide additional information about the function's behavior. They state that the function accepts an object, attempts to convert it into a tuple, and returns the resulting tuple. If the object is a list, the tuple will contain all elements from the list. If the object is not a list but is iterable (like a string), the tuple will contain its individual elements. If the object is not iterable, the function may raise an error.

Based on this information, the function appears to be correct. It does convert a list to a tuple as requested, and the output hints suggest that it behaves as expected for both lists and other iterable objects.

However, the problem description specifically asks for a function to convert a list to a tuple, not a function to convert any iterable to a tuple. The function `func_1` will work with any iterable, not just lists. But given the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we can conclude that the function is correct for the specific case of converting a list to a tuple.

Final: **True**
