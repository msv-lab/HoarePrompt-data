The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list, and returns a tuple containing all elements from `lst`. 

Upon examining the code line by line, it's clear that the function directly converts the input list into a tuple using the `tuple()` function. This operation does not modify the original list but creates a new tuple object containing all elements from the list.

Considering potential edge cases:
- If the input `lst` is not a list (e.g., it's a string, integer, or another type of object), the function will still attempt to convert it into a tuple. For some types (like strings or integers), this will result in a tuple where each element is an individual character or the integer itself, respectively. For other types, it might raise an error if they are not iterable.
- If the list is empty, the function will return an empty tuple.
- If the list contains mutable objects (like other lists or dictionaries) and these objects are modified after the tuple is created, the changes will be reflected in the tuple because tuples contain references to the original objects, not copies.

Given these considerations, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts an object, attempts to convert it into a tuple, and returns the resulting tuple. If the object is a list, the tuple will contain all elements from the list. If the object is not a list but is iterable (like a string), the tuple will contain its individual elements. If the object is not iterable, the function may raise an error. **
