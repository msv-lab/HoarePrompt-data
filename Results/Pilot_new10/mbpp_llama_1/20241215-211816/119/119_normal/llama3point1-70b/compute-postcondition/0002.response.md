The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are numbers. The function simply returns the values of `b` and `a`, effectively swapping the order of the input numbers. This functionality holds true for all potential cases, including positive numbers, negative numbers, fractions, and zero, as well as for cases where `a` and `b` are equal or different. There are no apparent edge cases or missing logic in the provided code. The code does exactly what the annotations describe, with no deviations or additional behaviors.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns them in reverse order, with `b` first and `a` second, without any conditions or modifications. **
