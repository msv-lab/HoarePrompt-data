To assess the correctness of the program based on the given problem description, let's break down the key elements:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number.

2. **Original Program**:
   ```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)
   ```
   This function indeed takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns them in reverse order as a tuple, which aligns with the problem description.

3. **Original Assessment**: None. Since there was no initial assessment provided, we have no baseline to compare against.

4. **Annotated Version of the Code**:
   ```python
# State of the program right before the function call: a and b are numbers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    # The program returns two numbers, b and a
   ```
   The annotation confirms that before the function is called, `a` and `b` are expected to be numbers, and the function returns these numbers in the order of `b` followed by `a`. However, it's worth noting that the return statement in the annotated code (`return b, a`) implicitly returns a tuple in Python, which is equivalent to the original code's explicit tuple return (`return (b, a)`).

Given the information above, the program as provided does indeed fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes two numbers as input and returns them in a tuple with the second number first, followed by the first number. The annotations support this interpretation and do not introduce any discrepancies with the original code's functionality.

Therefore, based on the strict problem description and the functionality of the code provided, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
