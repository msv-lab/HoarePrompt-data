You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.
Program:
```
def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple with `b` as the first element and `a` as the second element. This behavior exactly matches the problem description, which asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number first and then the first number.

To verify the correctness, let's consider various potential cases:

1. **Positive numbers**: If we call `func_1(10, 20)`, the function returns `(20, 10)`, which matches the problem description.
2. **Negative numbers**: If we call `func_1(-10, -20)`, the function returns `(-20, -10)`, which is correct.
3. **Zero and positive numbers**: If we call `func_1(0, 20)`, the function returns `(20, 0)`, which matches the problem description.
4. **Zero and negative numbers**: If we call `func_1(-10, 0)`, the function returns `(0, -10)`, which is correct.

In all the cases we can think of, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Since we cannot think of a single case where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns two numbers, b and a


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
