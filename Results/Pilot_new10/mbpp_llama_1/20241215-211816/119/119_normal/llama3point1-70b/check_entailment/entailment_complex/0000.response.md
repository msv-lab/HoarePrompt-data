To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the problem description and the annotated program.

The problem description requires a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.

The annotated program defines a function `func_1(a, b)` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns them in reverse order, i.e., `b` followed by `a`. The return statement `return b, a` in Python returns a tuple containing `b` and `a` in that order.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly takes two numbers as input and returns them in the reverse order as a tuple, with the second number (`b`) first and the first number (`a`) second, without any conditions or modifications.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases, as it does not include any conditional statements that could alter its behavior based on the input values. It simply and consistently returns the input numbers in reverse order as a tuple.

Correctness: **True**
