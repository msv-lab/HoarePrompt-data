Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct because it simply takes two input numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with `b` first and `a` second, as required by the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` is straightforward and handles all possible input cases without any exceptions or edge cases. It works correctly for all inputs, including positive and negative numbers, integers, and floats.

For example, `func_1(1, 2)` returns `(2, 1)`, `func_1(-1, 1)` returns `(1, -1)`, and `func_1(1.5, 2.5)` returns `(2.5, 1.5)`, which are all as expected according to the problem description. Since the program works as expected for all possible input cases, it is correct.
