Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number first and then the first number. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that does exactly that. The function takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple with `b` as the first element and `a` as the second element.

The annotated version of the code also supports the original assessment. The annotations state that the function accepts two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns them in reverse order, with `b` first and `a` second, without any conditions or modifications. This matches the problem description and the provided code.

However, upon closer inspection, it can be noticed that the annotated code has a return statement of `return b, a` instead of `return (b, a)`. Although in Python, `return b, a` will implicitly return a tuple `(b, a)`, the problem description specifically asks for a function that returns a tuple.

In this case, the original assessment is accurate because the function indeed returns a tuple with the second number first and then the first number, although the return statement is implicit.

Final: **True**
