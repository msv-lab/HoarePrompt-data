The original assessment seems to be accurate. The provided code is a simple function that takes two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with `b` first and `a` second, which is exactly as required by the problem description. The function is straightforward and does not have any conditions or edge cases that could potentially lead to incorrect results. The output hints also match the expected behavior of the function.

The problem description does not specify any particular input or output constraints, and it assumes that the inputs will be valid. The code handles this requirement correctly, as it simply reverses the order of the input numbers without performing any checks or modifications.

The provided examples, such as `func_1(1, 2)` returning `(2, 1)`, `func_1(-1, 1)` returning `(1, -1)`, and `func_1(1.5, 2.5)` returning `(2.5, 1.5)`, demonstrate that the function works as expected for different types of input numbers.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it can be concluded that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
