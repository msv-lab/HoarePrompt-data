The original assessment is "None", which means there was no assessment made about the program's correctness. 

The problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number. 

The provided code defines a function `func_1(a, b)` that returns `(b, a)`, which is a tuple with the second number `b` and then the first number `a`. This matches the problem description.

The annotated version of the code confirms this, stating that the function accepts two numbers `a` and `b`, and returns them in reverse order, with `b` first and `a` second.

Based on this information, it appears that the program is correct. The reason for this is that the function defined in the program correctly implements the behavior described in the problem description.

Final: **True**
