#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns b and a, where both b and a are numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns them in reverse order, i.e., `b` and `a`, without performing any operations or checks on the inputs.
