To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should take two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. 

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns them as a tuple in the reverse order, i.e., `(b, a)`. This seems to align with the problem description.

The output hints also support this interpretation, stating that the function accepts two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns them in reverse order without performing any operations or checks on the inputs.

Given that the original assessment is "None", it implies that there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. However, based on the provided code and the output hints, it appears that the program does indeed meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program's correctness should be assessed as accurate based on the problem description and the output hints.

Final: **True**
