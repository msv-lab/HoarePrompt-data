Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple with `b` followed by `a`. This functionality aligns perfectly with the given problem description. The function is implemented correctly as `return (b, a)`, which directly swaps the order of the input numbers and returns them as a tuple.

Upon reviewing the code, there are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that would cause the function to deviate from the problem description. The function does not make any assumptions about the input numbers (e.g., their sign, magnitude, or whether they are integers or floats), and it simply swaps their order. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further reinforce the correctness of the function by covering various scenarios.

Given the straightforward implementation and the lack of any identified issues or edge cases, it is reasonable to conclude that the program works as expected for all potential inputs and thus meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
