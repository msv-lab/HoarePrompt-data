Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` is designed to take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The function simply uses the `return (b, a)` statement to achieve this, where `b` is the second number and `a` is the first number.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the function correctly handles the task for all potential cases. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)`, `assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)`, and `assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)`, all pass as expected.

The function does not have any conditional statements or loops that could potentially cause it to fail for certain inputs. It is a straightforward function that simply returns a tuple with the input parameters in reverse order.

Given the simplicity of the function and the lack of any apparent edge cases that it does not handle, it appears that the function is correct for all potential inputs. Therefore, I conclude that the correctness of the function is **True**.
