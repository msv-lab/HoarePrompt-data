The original assessment is that the program is correct, which aligns with the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple where the second number is followed by the first number, which is exactly as specified in the problem.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment. It correctly identifies the state of the program before the function call, where `a` and `b` are numbers, and after the function call, where it returns `b` and `a`, both of which are numbers. The annotations provided do not indicate any discrepancies with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

Given the straightforward implementation, lack of identified edge cases, and the confirmation from the annotated version that the program behaves as expected, there is no reason to believe that the original assessment was inaccurate. The unit tests (`assert` statements) provided further reinforce this conclusion by demonstrating the function's correctness under different input scenarios.

Therefore, the final assessment is that the program is correct based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

Final: **True**
