The problem description requires a function to take two numbers as input and return a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. 

The original assessment is "None", which implies that no evaluation of the program's correctness was made.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which matches the problem description's requirement.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple containing `b` followed by `a`, which aligns with the expected behavior.

Since the original assessment is "None", we cannot say that the annotations lead us to believe it was not accurate. However, based on the code and annotations, we can conclude that the program is correct according to the problem description.

The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of the function's behavior, which matches the problem description. Therefore, we can confidently assess the program's correctness.

Final: **True**
