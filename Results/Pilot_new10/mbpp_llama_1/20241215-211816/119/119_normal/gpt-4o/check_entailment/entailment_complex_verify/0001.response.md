The original assessment was "None", indicating that there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. The problem description requires a function that takes two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that does exactly this: it takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns them in reverse order as a tuple `(b, a)`.

The annotated version of the code further clarifies the behavior of the function, indicating that it accepts two numbers and returns them in reverse order without performing any operations or checks on the inputs. This aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the program is correct as it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
