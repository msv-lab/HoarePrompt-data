The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to take two numbers as input and return them in reverse order as a tuple. The code `return (b, a)` directly achieves this, and the provided unit tests support its correctness.

The annotated version of the code reinforces this understanding, explaining the state of the program before the function call and the return values. It also correctly summarizes the function's behavior, stating that it returns the input numbers `a` and `b` in reverse order without performing any operations or checks on the inputs.

Given that the problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first, and both the original code and the annotated version align with this requirement, there's no indication that the original assessment was not accurate.

Final: **True**
