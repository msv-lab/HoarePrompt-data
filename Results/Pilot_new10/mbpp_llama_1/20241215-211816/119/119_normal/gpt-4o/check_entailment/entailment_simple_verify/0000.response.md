The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**. This assessment is based on the problem description, which requires a function to take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` meets this requirement by simply returning a tuple `(b, a)`, where `b` is the second number and `a` is the first number.

The unit tests provided in the code, such as `assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)`, `assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)`, and `assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)`, all pass as expected, which further supports the correctness of the function.

The annotated version of the code also confirms that the function behaves as expected. Before the function call, `a` and `b` are indeed numbers. The function then returns `b` and `a`, which are also numbers, thus meeting the problem's requirements.

Given the simplicity of the function, the passing unit tests, and the annotated code's confirmation of the expected behavior, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is inaccurate. Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains the same as the original assessment.

Final: **True**
