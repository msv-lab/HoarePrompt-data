You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)
assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)

def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` is designed to take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The function simply uses the `return (b, a)` statement to achieve this, where `b` is the second number and `a` is the first number.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the function correctly handles the task for all potential cases. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)`, `assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)`, and `assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)`, all pass as expected.

The function does not have any conditional statements or loops that could potentially cause it to fail for certain inputs. It is a straightforward function that simply returns a tuple with the input parameters in reverse order.

Given the simplicity of the function and the lack of any apparent edge cases that it does not handle, it appears that the function is correct for all potential inputs. Therefore, I conclude that the correctness of the function is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)
assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns b and a, where both b and a are numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns them in reverse order, i.e., `b` and `a`, without performing any operations or checks on the inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
