You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where the i-th element is equal to the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input tuple. This is achieved using the `zip` function, which pairs each element in the input tuple with the next one, and a generator expression that multiplies these pairs.

The code works as expected for all potential cases because:

- It correctly handles tuples of any length greater than 1, producing a tuple of length N-1 as required.
- It handles the edge case where the input tuple has only two elements, returning a tuple with one element (the product of the two input numbers).
- It handles the case where the input tuple contains zero or negative numbers correctly, as the operation defined does not depend on the sign or magnitude of the numbers.
- There is no mention of input validation in the problem description, but the code will implicitly expect input to be a tuple of numbers (either integers or floats) and will behave as expected for such inputs.

For example, given the input tuple `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, the function will correctly return `(2, 6, 12)`, which are the products of `(1*2, 2*3, 3*4)` respectively.

Therefore, since the code meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple of numbers and returns a tuple containing the products of consecutive elements; if the tuple has less than two elements, it returns an empty tuple.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
