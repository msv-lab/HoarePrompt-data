To determine the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the information provided.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that takes a tuple of numbers `(t_1,..., t_{N+1})` and returns a tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

2. **Program**:
   ```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))
```
   This function uses the `zip` function to pair each element in the input tuple with the next one (`numbers[1:]`), then multiplies each pair of elements together using a generator expression, and finally converts the result into a tuple.

3. **Original Assessment**: None

4. **Output Hints**:
   - The function accepts a tuple of numbers and returns a tuple containing the products of consecutive elements.
   - If the tuple has less than two elements, it returns an empty tuple.

Given the problem description and the code, the function behaves as expected for tuples with two or more elements because it correctly pairs each element with its successor, multiplies them, and returns these products as a tuple. The length of the output tuple is `N` when the input tuple has `N+1` elements, aligning with the problem description.

The output hints also suggest that the function handles edge cases properly, such as when the input tuple has less than two elements, in which case it returns an empty tuple. This behavior is consistent with the function's implementation because `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` would be empty if `numbers` has less than two elements, resulting in an empty tuple being returned.

Therefore, the original assessment of "None" implies a lack of evaluation rather than an inaccurate assessment. Based on the analysis, the function is correct according to the problem description and the provided output hints.

Final: **True**
