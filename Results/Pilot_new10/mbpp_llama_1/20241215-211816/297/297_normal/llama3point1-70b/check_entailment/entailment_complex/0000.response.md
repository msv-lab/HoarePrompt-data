Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the products of consecutive elements.

The line `return tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` uses the `zip` function to pair each element in the input tuple with the next element, and then multiplies these pairs together using a generator expression. The result is a tuple of products of consecutive elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. The `zip` function pairs each element in the input tuple `numbers` with the corresponding element in the tuple `numbers[1:]`. This effectively shifts the elements of the tuple one position to the right, so that each element is paired with the next one.
2. The generator expression `(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` multiplies each pair of elements together.
3. The `tuple` function converts the generator expression into a tuple.

For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, the `zip` function will pair the elements as follows: `(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)`. The generator expression will then multiply these pairs together, resulting in the tuple `(2, 6, 12)`.

The program handles the case where the input tuple has less than two elements correctly, because the `zip` function will return an empty iterator in this case, resulting in an empty tuple being returned.

Overall, the program correctly implements the function described in the problem description, and will work correctly for all potential cases.
