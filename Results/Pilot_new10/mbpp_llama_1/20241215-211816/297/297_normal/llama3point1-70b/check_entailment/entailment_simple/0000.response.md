To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it step by step against the provided problem description.

The problem description asks for a function that takes a tuple of numbers `(t_1,..., t_{N+1})` as input and returns a tuple of length `N` where the `i`-th element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

The provided function `func_1` uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to multiply consecutive elements from the input tuple `numbers`. It does this by using the `zip` function, which pairs elements from two iterables. In this case, it pairs each element in `numbers` with the element that follows it (`numbers[1:]`).

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- `numbers[1:]` generates a slice of the input tuple, starting from the second element to the end. This effectively shifts the tuple by one position, allowing each element to be paired with its following element.
- `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` pairs each element from `numbers` with the corresponding element from the shifted version of `numbers`. For example, if `numbers` is `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, `numbers[1:]` would be `(2, 3, 4)`, and `zip` would pair them as `(1,2)`, `(2,3)`, `(3,4)`.
- The generator expression `a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` then multiplies the elements of each pair. In the previous example, this would result in `1*2`, `2*3`, and `3*4`.
- Finally, `tuple(...)` converts the generator expression's results into a tuple, which is then returned by the function.

Considering the input `(t_1,..., t_{N+1})`, the function will indeed produce a tuple of length `N`, where each element `i` is the product of `t_i` and `t_{i+1}`, exactly as the problem description requires.

Therefore, **Correctness: True**. The program correctly implements the function as described in the problem description and will work for all valid inputs (tuples of numbers with a length of at least 2).
