The original assessment is None, which means it does not provide any information about the program's correctness. 

Looking at the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the products of consecutive elements from the input tuple. 

The annotated code explains the state of the program before the function call and the state after the function returns. It states that the program returns a tuple containing the products of consecutive elements from the input tuple `numbers`. This matches the problem description.

The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the input tuple `numbers` and `numbers[1:]` in parallel, which means it will iterate over the elements of the input tuple and the elements of the same tuple but shifted by one position. This allows it to calculate the product of each element and the next one.

Based on this analysis, the program seems to be correct. The function does what the problem description asks for, and the annotated code provides a clear explanation of the program's behavior.

Therefore, the final assessment is:
Final: **True**
