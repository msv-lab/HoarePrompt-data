Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. The function takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where the i-th element is the product of the i-th and (i+1)th elements of the input tuple.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

* The `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` expression pairs each element in the input tuple with the next element. This is exactly what is needed to compute the products of consecutive elements.
* The generator expression `(a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` computes the products of these pairs of elements.
* The `tuple()` function converts the generator expression into a tuple, which is the desired output format.
* If the input tuple has less than two elements, `numbers[1:]` will be an empty tuple, and `zip()` will produce an empty iterator. In this case, the generator expression will also be empty, and the function will return an empty tuple, which is consistent with the output hints.

The output hints are also consistent with the code's behavior. For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, 3)`, the function will return `(2, 6)`, which is the tuple of products of consecutive elements. If the input tuple is `(1)`, the function will return `()`, which is an empty tuple, as expected. 

Overall, the code correctly implements the function described in the problem statement, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
