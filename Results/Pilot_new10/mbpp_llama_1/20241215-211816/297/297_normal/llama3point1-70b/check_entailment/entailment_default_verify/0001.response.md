The original assessment is "None" which implies that there is no previous evaluation or conclusion about the correctness of the program. 

The problem description requires a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements in the input tuple. 

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that uses the `zip` function to pair consecutive elements from the input tuple `numbers` and then uses a generator expression to calculate the product of each pair. The results are returned as a tuple, which has a length one less than the input tuple, as expected.

The output hints describe the behavior of `func_1`, including the case when the input tuple has less than two elements, in which case the function correctly returns an empty tuple.

Considering the problem description, the code provided, and the output hints, the function appears to correctly implement the required behavior.

Final: **True**
