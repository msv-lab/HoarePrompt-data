Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. 

The problem description asks for a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers `(t_1,..., t_{N+1})` and returns a tuple of length `N` where the `i`-th element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

The provided function `func_1` does exactly this. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the input tuple `t`, multiplying each element `t[i]` by the next element `t[i + 1]`, and returns the result as a tuple.

The function handles the edge case where the input tuple has less than two elements correctly, returning an empty tuple in this case, which is consistent with the problem description.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs, including tuples of different lengths and with different values.

Overall, the program meets the requirements in the problem description and is correct. 

Here are some key points that demonstrate the correctness of the program:

1. The function takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple of numbers.
2. The `i`-th element of the returned tuple is the product of the `i`-th and `(i+1)`-th elements of the input tuple.
3. The function handles the edge case where the input tuple has less than two elements correctly.
4. The unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements in the problem description.
