Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` meets the problem description's requirements. It takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where the i-th element is equal to the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input tuple.

The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` function to calculate the products, and it correctly handles the case where the input tuple has only one element, returning an empty tuple.

The given unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios. 

Here's a breakdown of why this function works correctly:
- It uses `range(len(t) - 1)` to iterate over the indices of the input tuple, stopping at the second-to-last element. This is correct because the i-th element in the output tuple should be the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input tuple.
- It uses a generator expression `(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))` to calculate the products. This is correct because it ensures that each i-th element in the output tuple is the product of the corresponding elements from the input tuple.
- The `tuple()` function is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple, which meets the problem's requirement for the output format.

Without finding any counterexample or potential case where the function does not work as expected, it can be concluded that the function is correct according to the provided problem description.
