You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.
Program:
```
assert func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)
assert func_1((2, 4, 5, 6, 7)) == (8, 20, 30, 42)
assert func_1((12, 13, 14, 9, 15)) == (156, 182, 126, 135)
assert func_1((12,)) == ()

def func_1(t):
    return tuple((t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` meets the problem description's requirements. It takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where the i-th element is equal to the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input tuple.

The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` function to calculate the products, and it correctly handles the case where the input tuple has only one element, returning an empty tuple.

The given unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios. 

Here's a breakdown of why this function works correctly:
- It uses `range(len(t) - 1)` to iterate over the indices of the input tuple, stopping at the second-to-last element. This is correct because the i-th element in the output tuple should be the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input tuple.
- It uses a generator expression `(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))` to calculate the products. This is correct because it ensures that each i-th element in the output tuple is the product of the corresponding elements from the input tuple.
- The `tuple()` function is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple, which meets the problem's requirement for the output format.

Without finding any counterexample or potential case where the function does not work as expected, it can be concluded that the function is correct according to the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)
assert func_1((2, 4, 5, 6, 7)) == (8, 20, 30, 42)
assert func_1((12, 13, 14, 9, 15)) == (156, 182, 126, 135)
assert func_1((12,)) == ()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers with at least two elements.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple `t`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
