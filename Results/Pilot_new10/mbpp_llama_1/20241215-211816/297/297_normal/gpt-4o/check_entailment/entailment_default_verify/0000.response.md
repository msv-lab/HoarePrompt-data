The original assessment and the provided output hints align well with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple. The function handles the edge case where the input tuple has less than two elements by returning an empty tuple, which is consistent with the problem description and the output hints.

The generator expression `(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))` within the `tuple()` function is a concise and efficient way to calculate the products of consecutive elements. The use of `range(len(t) - 1)` ensures that the function stops at the second-to-last element of the input tuple, which is correct since the last element does not have a consecutive element to pair with.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios, including tuples with multiple elements and a tuple with a single element. The output hints also summarize the code's functionality accurately and do not reveal any potential issues or counterexamples that could indicate the function is incorrect.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.

Final: **True**
