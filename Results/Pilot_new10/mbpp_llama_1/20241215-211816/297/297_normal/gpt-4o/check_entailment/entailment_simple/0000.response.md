Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and always does what the problem description says. Here's why:

1. The problem description requires the function to take a tuple of numbers `(t_1,..., t_{N+1})` as input and return a tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.
2. The function `func_1(t)` uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the input tuple `t`, stopping one index before the end of the tuple (due to `range(len(t) - 1)`).
3. For each index `i`, the function multiplies the `i-th` element of the tuple (`t[i]`) by the `(i+1)-th` element (`t[i + 1]`).
4. The results of these multiplications are collected into a new tuple using the `tuple` constructor, which is then returned by the function.
5. The unit tests provided demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for various input tuples, including tuples with different lengths and element values.
6. The edge case where the input tuple has only one element is also handled correctly, as the function returns an empty tuple (`()`), which is consistent with the problem description (since there are no pairs of consecutive elements to multiply).

In summary, the program implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description, and the provided unit tests confirm its correctness for various input scenarios.
