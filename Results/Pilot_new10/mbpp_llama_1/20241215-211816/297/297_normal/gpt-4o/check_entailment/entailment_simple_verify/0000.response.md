The original assessment seems to be accurate. The provided function `func_1` meets the problem description's requirements. It takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where the i-th element is equal to the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input tuple. 

The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment. The annotation before the function call states that `t` is a tuple of numbers with at least two elements, but the function can handle tuples with one element (as shown by the unit test `assert func_1((12,)) == ()`). The annotation inside the function states that the program returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple `t`, which aligns with the problem description.

The given unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios, including tuples with multiple elements and a tuple with one element.

The function's implementation uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` function to calculate the products, which is a correct and efficient approach. 

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
