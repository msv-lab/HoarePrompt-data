Postcondition: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `undulating` is `True`, `i` is 1. The current value of `n` at index `i-1` is less than the value at index `i` and the value at index `i` is less than the value at index `i+1`, or the value at index `i-1` is greater than the value at index `i` and the value at index `i` is greater than the value at index `i+1`.**
