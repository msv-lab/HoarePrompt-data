Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 100, `s` has a length of at least 5, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 4. If `i` is even and the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to `first_digit`, or if `i` is odd and the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
