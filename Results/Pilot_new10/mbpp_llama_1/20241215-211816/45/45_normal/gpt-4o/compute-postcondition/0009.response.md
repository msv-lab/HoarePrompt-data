To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement: `for i in range(2, len(s)):`. This loop will execute if the length of the string `s` is at least 3, because the range starts at 2 and goes up to, but does not include, the length of `s`. 

Given that:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 100.
- `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of more than or equal to 3.
- `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, which is the first digit of `n`.
- `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, which is the second digit of `n`.
- The `first_digit` is not equal to the `second_digit`.

For the loop to execute, it is crucial that `s` has at least 3 characters because the loop starts from index 2. Given that `s` represents `n` and `n` is at least 100, `s` will indeed have at least 3 characters. 

Thus, the conditions given are sufficient for the loop to potentially execute, but to explicitly state the conditions at the start of the loop:
- `n` must be at least 100.
- `s` must have a length of at least 3.
- `first_digit` and `second_digit` must be different.
- `i` is about to be set to 2, which is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`n` is at least 100, `s` has a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 2**
