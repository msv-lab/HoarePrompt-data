Postcondition: **`n` is at least 100, `s` has a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 2, and since `i` is even, `s[2]` is equal to `first_digit`. The current value of `i` is odd (as per the if condition `i % 2 == 1`), and the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`.**
