To determine the output state, we need to consider the initial conditions and the given Python code snippet. The initial state provides several conditions:

- `n` is at least 100.
- `s` has a length of at least 5.
- `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`.
- `i` is 4.

The code snippet simply returns `False`. This return statement does not depend on any variables' values or conditions; it will always return `False` when executed.

Given this information:

Output State: **The program returns False**
