Postcondition: **`n` is at least 100, `s` has a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 2, and since `i` is 2 (an even number), `s[2]` is equal to `first_digit`. Additionally, it is not the case that `i` is odd and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`, which simplifies to either `i` is even (which is true since `i` is 2) or `s[i]` is equal to `second_digit`. Given `i` is even, the condition that `i` is odd is false, so the negation of the if condition implies that since `i` is even, there's no requirement for `s[i]` to not be equal to `second_digit` based on the if condition's negation directly, but considering `i` is 2 and the original condition that `s[2]` equals `first_digit`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, it implies `s[2]` is not equal to `second_digit`. Therefore, the state includes that `i` is 2, `s[2]` equals `first_digit`, and `s[2]` does not equal `second_digit`, maintaining all original conditions and accounting for the if condition's negation.**
