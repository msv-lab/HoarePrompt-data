The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `input_list` and `input_tuple`. According to the code, it returns a new list that is the combination of the elements in `input_list` and the elements in `input_tuple`. 

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the function does not check the types of `input_list` and `input_tuple`, so it will throw an error if they are not a list and a tuple, respectively. However, if `input_tuple` is indeed a tuple, the code will work as expected and return a list that is the combination of the original list `input_list` and the elements of `input_tuple`.

It's worth noting that the function does not handle any potential errors that might occur when trying to convert `input_tuple` to a list or when trying to concatenate `input_list` and the list version of `input_tuple`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept a list and a tuple as input, attempt to combine them into a single list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating the two, and return the resulting list, assuming that the inputs are indeed a list and a tuple.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list and a tuple as parameters and returns a new list that is the combination of the elements in the input list and the input tuple, provided that the inputs are indeed a list and a tuple. **
