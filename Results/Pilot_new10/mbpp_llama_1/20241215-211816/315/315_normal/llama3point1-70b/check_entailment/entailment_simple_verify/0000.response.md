The original assessment is None, which means there is no prior evaluation of the program's correctness. Given the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` appears to correctly add the elements of the given tuple to the given list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the original list.

The annotated version of the code supports this understanding, indicating that the program returns a list that combines the original list `input_list` and the elements of `input_tuple`. This aligns with the problem description to add the given tuple to the given list.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the program seems to be correct as it fulfills the requirement stated in the problem description.

Final: **True**
