You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given function does not add the tuple to the list, but rather converts the tuple to a list and then concatenates it to the input list. This means the original list remains unchanged. 

For example, if we call the function with the following inputs:
```python
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
input_tuple = (4, 5, 6)
result = func_1(input_list, input_tuple)
print(input_list)  # prints: [1, 2, 3]
```
As we can see, the original list `input_list` remains unchanged. The function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the input tuple converted to a list, but it does not modify the original list. 

A correct implementation of the function would modify the original list by appending the tuple to it. Here's an example of how it could be done:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
Alternatively, if the intention is to add the elements of the tuple to the list, not the tuple itself, the function could be modified as follows:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.extend(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list and input_tuple is a tuple.
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)
    #The program returns a list that is a combination of the original list 'input_list' and the elements of 'input_tuple'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list and a tuple as parameters and returns a new list that is the combination of the elements in the input list and the input tuple, provided that the inputs are indeed a list and a tuple.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
