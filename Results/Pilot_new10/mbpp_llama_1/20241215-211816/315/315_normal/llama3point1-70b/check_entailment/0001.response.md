Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks to add the given tuple to the given list, but the provided program converts the tuple to a list and then concatenates it to the original list, effectively creating a new list with the elements of the original list followed by the elements of the tuple. However, it does not add the tuple as a single element to the list.

For example, if we have the list `[1, 2, 3]` and the tuple `(4, 5, 6)`, the program will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, but the expected output should be `[1, 2, 3, (4, 5, 6)]`. 

A correct implementation of the function would be:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
Or, if the function should not modify the original list:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + [input_tuple]
```
