To assess the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the output hints, we need to carefully examine each component:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that adds a given tuple to a given list. 

2. **Program**:
   ```python
   def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
       return input_list + list(input_tuple)
   ```
   This function takes a list and a tuple as inputs, converts the tuple into a list, and then concatenates this list with the input list, returning the result as a new list.

3. **Original Assessment**: None. There's no previous assessment to evaluate against.

4. **Output Hints**:
   - The function accepts a list and a tuple as parameters.
   - It returns a new list that is the combination of the elements in the input list and the input tuple.

Given these points, let's evaluate the program's correctness:

- The program correctly takes a list and a tuple as inputs, as specified.
- It converts the tuple into a list and concatenates it with the input list, which aligns with a reasonable interpretation of "adding" a tuple to a list, considering the nature of these data types in Python.
- The output hint confirms that the function behaves as expected in terms of input parameters and return type.

The key point here is that the function does not modify the original list but returns a new list that includes the elements from both the original list and the tuple. This is a common and correct approach in Python for such operations, given the language's preference for immutable data structures and the need to avoid side effects in functions.

**Reasoning for Final Assessment**:

- The program implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement.
- It handles the conversion of the tuple to a list correctly before concatenation, ensuring the output is a list as expected.
- The output hints align with the expected behavior of the function.

**Final: True**
