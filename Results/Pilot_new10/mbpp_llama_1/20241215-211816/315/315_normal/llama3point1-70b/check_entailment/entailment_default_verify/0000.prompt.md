You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given function does not add the tuple to the list, but rather converts the tuple to a list and then concatenates it to the input list. This means the original list remains unchanged. 

For example, if we call the function with the following inputs:
```python
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
input_tuple = (4, 5, 6)
result = func_1(input_list, input_tuple)
print(input_list)  # prints: [1, 2, 3]
```
As we can see, the original list `input_list` remains unchanged. The function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the input tuple converted to a list, but it does not modify the original list. 

A correct implementation of the function would modify the original list by appending the tuple to it. Here's an example of how it could be done:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
Alternatively, if the intention is to add the elements of the tuple to the list, not the tuple itself, the function could be modified as follows:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.extend(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list and a tuple as parameters and returns a new list that is the combination of the elements in the input list and the input tuple, provided that the inputs are indeed a list and a tuple.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
