Based on the provided problem description, code, and output hints, the original assessment of "None" does not imply any judgment about the correctness of the code. However, after reviewing all the information, I can make an assessment of the code's correctness.

The problem description requires a function to add a given tuple to a given list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, converts the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)`, and then concatenates this list to the input list `lst` using the `+` operator.

The output hints indicate that the function accepts a list and a tuple and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the tuple converted to a list. This description matches the functionality of the provided code.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, I believe that the code is correct because it correctly implements the required functionality of adding a tuple to a list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it to the original list.

Final: **True**
