Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` adds the elements of a given tuple to the end of a given list. The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list with the tuple converted to a list using the `list()` function. This approach works correctly for all potential cases.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs. The function handles tuples of any length and lists of any length, and it correctly returns a new list with the tuple elements appended to the end of the original list.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail or produce incorrect results. The function does not modify the original list, but instead returns a new list, which is a desirable behavior in many situations.

The use of `return lst + list(tpl)` ensures that the function works correctly even if the tuple contains non-hashable types or mutable objects, as it simply converts the tuple to a list and appends it to the original list.

Overall, the function is correct and works as expected for all potential inputs, which is why the correctness is **True**.
