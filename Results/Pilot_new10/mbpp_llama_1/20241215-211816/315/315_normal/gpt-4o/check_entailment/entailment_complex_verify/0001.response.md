The original assessment is "None", which implies that no initial assessment was made. 

The problem description requires a function to add a given tuple to a given list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, converts the tuple to a list using the `list()` function, and then concatenates it with the input list using the `+` operator.

The annotated version of the code provides additional context, stating that the function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the tuple converted to a list. This matches the problem description and the provided code.

Based on the information available, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It accepts a list and a tuple, converts the tuple to a list, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the converted tuple.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`, also support the correctness of the function.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
