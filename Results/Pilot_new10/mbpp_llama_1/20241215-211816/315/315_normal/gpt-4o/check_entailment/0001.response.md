Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, and it correctly adds the elements of the tuple to the end of the list.

The program uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list with the tuple, which is converted to a list using the `list()` function before concatenation. This approach ensures that the resulting list contains all the elements from the original list and the tuple.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the program for different inputs. Additionally, the program should work correctly for any valid input list and tuple, including empty lists and tuples, because the `+` operator and `list()` function handle these cases correctly.

For example, the following cases would also work correctly:
- An empty list: `func_1([], (1, 2))` would return `[1, 2]`.
- An empty tuple: `func_1([3, 4], ())` would return `[3, 4]`.
- A list and tuple containing non-integer values: `func_1(['a', 'b'], ('c', 'd'))` would return `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`.

Since the program handles all these potential cases correctly, it is considered correct.
