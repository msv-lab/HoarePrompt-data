The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly adds the elements of a given tuple to the end of a given list by using the `+` operator to concatenate the list with the tuple converted to a list using the `list()` function.

The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior, stating that the function returns a list that is the concatenation of the input list and the tuple converted to a list.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs, and the function handles tuples of any length and lists of any length correctly.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function does not modify the original list, but instead returns a new list, which is a desirable behavior in many situations.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
