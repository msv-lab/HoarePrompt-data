The function func_1 accepts two parameters: a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`. It returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl` converted to a list.

Looking at the code line by line, we can see that it does exactly what the annotations say. The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate `lst` and `list(tpl)`, which converts the tuple `tpl` to a list before concatenating it with `lst`. 

There are no potential edge cases or missing logic in this function. It handles any type of list and tuple, including empty ones, and always returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and tuple.
