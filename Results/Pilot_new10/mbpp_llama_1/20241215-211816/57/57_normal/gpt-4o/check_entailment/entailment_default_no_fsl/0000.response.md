Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to apply the `sorted` function to each sublist, which sorts the strings in ascending order.

The function assumes that the input is a list of lists of strings, which is in line with the problem description. It also assumes that the input structure is correct and does not handle invalid or nested structures beyond the first level. However, this is also implied by the problem description, which does not specify any error handling for such cases.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs, including lists with different numbers of sublists and strings. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code's functionality, explaining that the function sorts each sublist in ascending order and returns the sorted list of lists.

Since the function correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases and handles the specified inputs as expected, its correctness is confirmed.
