The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension with the built-in `sorted` function to achieve this, which returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence in ascending order. 

The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly, sorting each sublist of strings alphabetically. Additionally, the function does not modify the original list, which is a desirable behavior in many scenarios, and it works with sublists of varying lengths.

The annotated version of the code further supports this assessment, as it correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call. Before the function call, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist contains strings. After the function call, the program returns a list of lists with the same structure as the original `list_of_lists`, but with each sublist containing strings in sorted order.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
