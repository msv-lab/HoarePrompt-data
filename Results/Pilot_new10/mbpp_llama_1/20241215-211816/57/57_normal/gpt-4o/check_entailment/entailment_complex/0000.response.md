Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Sorting each sublist of strings**: The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists`. For each sublist, it applies the `sorted()` function, which sorts the elements of the sublist in ascending order.

2. **Returning the sorted list of lists**: The program returns a new list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as in the original `list_of_lists`, but in sorted order.

3. **Preserving the original structure**: The program preserves the original structure of `list_of_lists`, with the same number of sublists and the same number of elements in each sublist.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the program's correctness for various input cases. The program correctly sorts each sublist and returns the sorted list of lists, as expected.

However, it's worth noting that the program may raise errors for certain edge cases, such as:

* Non-comparable elements (e.g., mixing strings with integers or other types)
* Null inputs (e.g., `None` instead of a list of lists)
* Invalid input structure (e.g., a nested list of lists, or a flat list of strings)

But, according to the problem description, the function assumes the input structure is correct and does not handle these edge cases. Therefore, within the bounds of the specified requirements, the program is correct.
