#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings in sorted order, with the same sublists structure as the original `list_of_lists`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of strings, sorts each sublist in ascending order, and returns the sorted list of lists. It assumes the input structure is correct and does not handle invalid or nested structures beyond the first level, potentially raising errors for non-comparable elements, null inputs, or if the input is not a list of lists.
