The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings. 

Looking at the code line by line, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists`. For each sublist, it sorts the strings in a case-insensitive alphabetical order using the `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument. 

The sorted sublists are then returned as a new list of lists. 

The code handles empty sublists and sublists with a single element correctly, as the `sorted` function can handle these cases without issues. 

It also handles the case where the input `list_of_lists` is an empty list, as the list comprehension will simply return an empty list in this case. 

The code does not perform any error checking on the input, so if the input is not a list of lists, or if the sublists contain non-string elements, the code may raise an error or produce unexpected results. 

However, based on the provided annotations and code, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists of strings, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive alphabetical order, assuming the input is a list of lists containing only strings **
