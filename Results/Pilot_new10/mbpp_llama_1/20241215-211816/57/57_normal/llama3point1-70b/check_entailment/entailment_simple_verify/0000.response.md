The original assessment seems to make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` is designed to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, and it uses a list comprehension with the `sorted` function and the `key=str.lower` argument to achieve this in a case-insensitive manner. The annotated version of the code also confirms this understanding, as it states that the program returns a list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive alphabetical order.

There are no obvious inconsistencies or errors in the original assessment or the annotated code that would lead me to believe the original assessment is not accurate. The test cases provided in the original assessment also seem to cover different scenarios and confirm that the function behaves as expected.

Therefore, based on the information available, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
