Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly checks whether every odd index in a list contains an odd number. The program iterates over the list, starting from the first odd index (index 1), and checks if the number at that index is odd. If it finds an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates over all odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`, indicating that all elements at odd indices in the list are odd.

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop `for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):` correctly iterates over all odd indices in the list, starting from index 1 (which is the first odd index in a 0-based indexing system) and stepping by 2 to visit only odd indices.
   
2. **Odd Number Check**: Inside the loop, the condition `if lst[i] % 2 == 0:` checks if the number at the current odd index `i` is even. If it is, the function immediately returns `False` because it has found an even number at an odd index, violating the condition specified by the problem.

3. **Completion and Return**: If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`, correctly indicating that all elements at odd indices in the list are indeed odd.

The unit tests provided (`assert` statements) further validate the correctness of the function for different scenarios, including lists where the condition holds true and a case where it does not hold true.

Therefore, the program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description, checking whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number.
