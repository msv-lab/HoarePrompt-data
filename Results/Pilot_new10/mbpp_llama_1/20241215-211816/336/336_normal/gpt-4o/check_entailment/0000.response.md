Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function, `func_1`, correctly checks whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

- The function `func_1` iterates over the list `lst` starting from index 1 (which is the first odd index in Python) and increments the index by 2 in each iteration to cover all odd indices.
- For each odd index `i`, it checks if the element `lst[i]` is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the remainder of `lst[i]` divided by 2 is 0, then `lst[i]` is even.
- If an even number is found at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`.
- If the function iterates through all odd indices without finding an even number, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function:

- `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` returns `True` because the elements at odd indices (1, 3, 7) are odd (1, 3, 7).
- `func_1([4, 1, 2])` returns `True` because the element at the only odd index (1) is odd (1).
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` because the element at the odd index (1) is even (2).

Overall, the function works correctly for the given examples and follows the problem description. If the list is empty or has a single element (at an even index), the function will still return `True` because there are no odd indices to check. This edge case is also handled correctly according to the problem description.
