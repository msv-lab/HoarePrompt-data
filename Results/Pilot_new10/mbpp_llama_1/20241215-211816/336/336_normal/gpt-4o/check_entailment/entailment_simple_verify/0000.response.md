The original assessment is "None", which means that there is no initial assessment provided. 

To evaluate the correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem description and the provided code. The problem description asks to write a Python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input and returns `True` if all elements at odd indices are odd, and `False` otherwise.

The annotated code provides additional information about the state of the program at different points. 

Let's examine the logic of the function:
1. The loop iterates over the list starting from the second element (index 1) and checks every other element (since the step size is 2). This corresponds to checking the elements at odd indices.
2. If an element at an odd index is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`), the function immediately returns `False`.
3. If the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`, indicating that all elements at odd indices are odd.

Based on the code and its annotations, the function appears to be correct. It correctly checks the elements at odd indices and returns the expected result.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function:
- `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True` because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 7) are odd.
- `func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True` because the element at the odd index (1) is odd.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False` because the element at the odd index (1) is even.

Since there was no initial assessment, we cannot say whether the original assessment was accurate or not. However, based on the analysis of the code, the annotations, and the unit tests, the program appears to be correct.

Final: **True**
