Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated code, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. The annotations provided in the code also support this assessment.

The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (which is the first odd index in Python) and increments the index by 2 in each iteration to cover all odd indices. For each odd index `i`, it checks if the element `lst[i]` is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the remainder of `lst[i]` divided by 2 is 0, then `lst[i]` is even, and the function immediately returns `False`. If the function iterates through all odd indices without finding an even number, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

The annotated version of the code does not provide any information that would suggest the original assessment is inaccurate. The annotations describe the state of the program at different points and support the conclusion that the function works correctly.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
