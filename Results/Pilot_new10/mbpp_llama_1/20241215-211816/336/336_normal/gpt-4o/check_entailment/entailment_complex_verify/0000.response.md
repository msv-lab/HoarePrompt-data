The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial assessment of the program's correctness.

After reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I believe the program is correct.

The problem description requires a function to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. The provided code implements this functionality by iterating over the list with a step size of 2, starting from index 1 (which is the first odd index). If it encounters an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

The annotated version of the code confirms this understanding, describing the state of the program before and after the loop, as well as the overall functionality of the function.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
