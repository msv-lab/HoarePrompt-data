To assess the correctness of the program, we need to compare it against the problem description: "Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list."

The original assessment is "None," which doesn't provide any information about the correctness of the program.

Looking at the provided code:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

The code iterates through the list, starting from index 1 (which is the first odd index in 0-based indexing), and checks every other element (due to the step size of 2 in the `range` function). If it finds any element at an odd index that is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices contain odd numbers.

The annotated version of the code explains the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the logic described above. It correctly notes that if the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all elements at odd indices are odd, and thus the function returns `True`.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment of "None" should be updated to reflect that the program is indeed correct based on the information provided and the analysis of the code's logic.

Final: **True**
