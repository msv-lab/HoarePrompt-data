The original assessment and the annotated version of the code both accurately describe the functionality of the provided Python function `func_1`. The function iterates over the list, starting from index 1, and checks if the numbers at odd indexes are odd. If it encounters an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indexes, it returns `True`.

The unit tests also support the correctness of the function. They demonstrate that the function works as expected for different scenarios, including lists with multiple elements at odd indexes and lists with a single element at an odd index.

The annotations provided in the code accurately describe the state of the program before the function call, after the `for` loop has been executed, and when the program returns. These annotations align with the original assessment of the code's functionality.

No information has been found that contradicts the original assessment. The function appears to be correct according to the given problem description, and it correctly checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number.

Final: **True**
