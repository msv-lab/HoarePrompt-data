The original assessment correctly evaluated the program's correctness based on the provided unit tests and code explanation. The output hints further confirm the program's functionality, stating that it returns `True` if all elements at odd indices in the list are odd or if the list has less than two elements, and `False` otherwise. 

Upon reviewing the code and the output hints, it's evident that the function `func_1` accurately implements the desired behavior. The function iterates over the list's odd indices and checks for odd numbers, returning `False` at the first occurrence of an even number at an odd index and `True` otherwise.

The output hints do not reveal any additional scenarios where the function might fail, and the original assessment thoroughly considered the provided unit tests and code logic. Therefore, there's no reason to doubt the original assessment.

The key points to consider are:
- The code correctly implements the logic for checking odd indices in a list.
- The output hints align with the code's expected behavior and do not indicate any potential flaws.
- The original assessment thoroughly analyzed the code and unit tests, finding no issues with the implementation.

Final: **True**
