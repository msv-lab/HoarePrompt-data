Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment of "None" implies that there is no initial assessment to evaluate. However, with the given code and output hints, we can assess the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires a function to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that iterates over the list at odd indices (starting from index 1, incrementing by 2) and checks if the element at each index is odd by using the condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0`. If it encounters an even element at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it successfully checks all odd indices without finding any even elements, it returns `True`.

The output hints suggest the same functionality: the function returns `True` if all elements at odd indices are odd (or if the list has less than two elements, which implies there are no odd indices to check), and it returns `False` as soon as it finds an even element at an odd index.

Comparing the problem description with the provided code and output hints, it appears that the code correctly implements the required functionality. The code accurately checks each odd index in the list for odd numbers and returns `True` if all such indices contain odd numbers, or `False` otherwise. The special case where the list has less than two elements is inherently handled correctly because the loop condition `range(1, len(lst), 2)` will not be entered if the list length is less than 2, resulting in the function returning `True` due to the lack of odd indices to check.

Therefore, the original assessment of "None" becomes irrelevant as we now have a basis to evaluate the program's correctness.

Final: **True**
