You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. Here's why:

- The function iterates over the list using a for loop with a step of 2, starting from index 1. This ensures that it only considers the odd indexes of the list.
- For each odd index `i`, it checks if the number at that index `lst[i]` is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). If `lst[i] % 2 == 0`, it means the number is even, and the function immediately returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indexes, the function returns `True`, indicating that every odd index in the list contains an odd number.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function:

- The first test `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True` passes because the numbers at odd indexes (1, 3, 7, 3) are all odd.
- The second test `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True` passes because the number at the odd index (1) is odd.
- The third test `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False` passes because the number at the odd index (2) is even, so the function correctly returns `False`.

After analyzing the code and the provided tests, it appears that the function works as expected for all potential cases, and no counterexamples can be found where the program does not work correctly according to the given problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers where all elements at odd indices are odd if the loop completes without returning `False`, otherwise the loop returns `False` as soon as an even element at an odd index is found.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating all elements at odd indices in the list are odd


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
