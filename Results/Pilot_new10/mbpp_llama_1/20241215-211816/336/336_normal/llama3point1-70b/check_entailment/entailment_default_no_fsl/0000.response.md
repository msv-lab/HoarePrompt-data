Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list. The function iterates over the list using a for loop and checks each index to see if it is odd (`i % 2!= 0`). If the index is odd, it then checks if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an odd index with an even value, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates over the entire list without finding any such case, it returns `True`.

The function correctly handles all potential edge cases, including empty lists and lists of varying lengths and compositions. For example, if the list is empty, the function will return `True` because there are no odd indices with even values. If the list has only one element, the function will return `True` if the element is at an even index, regardless of whether the element is odd or even, and it will check the element's value if it's at an odd index.

The output hints provided agree with the code's functionality, and there are no apparent cases where the function would not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct and handles all potential cases as described.
