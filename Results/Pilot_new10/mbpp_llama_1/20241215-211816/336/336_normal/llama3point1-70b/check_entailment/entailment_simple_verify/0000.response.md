The original assessment is `None`, which means there is no initial assessment to evaluate. 

To determine the correctness of the program, we will analyze the problem description and the provided code. The problem requires writing a Python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that iterates over the list using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is odd (`i % 2!= 0`) and if the value at that index `lst[i]` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are true, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list does not meet the condition.

If the loop completes without finding any even values at odd indices, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list meets the condition.

The annotated version of the code provides additional information about the state of the program at different points. It confirms that the function iterates over the list, checks the conditions, and returns the correct result based on the conditions.

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct. It accurately checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers in the given list and returns the correct result.

Final: **True**
