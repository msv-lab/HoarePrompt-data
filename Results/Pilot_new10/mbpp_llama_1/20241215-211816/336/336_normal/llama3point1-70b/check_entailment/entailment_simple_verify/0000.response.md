Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The annotated version of the code also confirms this assessment. 

The function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. It iterates over the list, checking two conditions for each index: 
1. If the index is odd (`i % 2!= 0`).
2. If the value at the index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).

If both conditions are met, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates over the entire list without finding any such case, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

The annotated code also correctly describes the state of the program at different points. Before the function call, `lst` is a list of integers. After the loop has been executed, `lst` is still a list of integers, `i` is `len(lst) - 1` if `lst` is not empty, and the function did not return `False` due to an odd index with an even value in `lst`.

The original assessment correctly handles lists of any length, including empty lists. For an empty list, the function would return `True` because there are no odd indices to check. 

The reason I am keeping the original assessment is that it accurately describes the functionality of the provided code, which correctly checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number.

Final: **True**
