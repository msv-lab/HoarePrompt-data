Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The function `func_1` iterates through the list using a for loop and checks each index `i` to see if it's odd (`i % 2!= 0`) and if the corresponding list element `lst[i]` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds such a case, it immediately returns `False`. If it goes through the entire list without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`. 

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function covers all potential edge cases, including empty lists and lists of varying lengths and compositions. The code correctly handles these edge cases because it simply returns `True` for empty lists (since there are no odd indices to check) and correctly checks the indices and values for lists of any length.

The code's logic is straightforward and aligns with the problem description. It checks every odd index to ensure the value at that index is odd, and if any odd index contains an even value, it correctly returns `False`. Therefore, the code does what the problem description says for every potential case.
