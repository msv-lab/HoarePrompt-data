You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The function iterates over the list using the index `i`, and for each index, it checks two conditions: 
1. If the index `i` is odd (`i % 2!= 0`).
2. If the value at the index `i` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).

If both conditions are met (i.e., an odd index contains an even number), the function immediately returns `False`. If the function iterates over the entire list without finding any such case, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs for which the function would fail to work as described. The function correctly handles lists of any length, including empty lists (though the function would return `True` for an empty list, as there are no odd indices to check), and it correctly identifies whether odd indices contain odd numbers. Therefore, the function is correct according to the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers and returns True if no odd-indexed elements in the list have even values; otherwise, it returns False, covering all potential edge cases including empty lists and lists of varying lengths and compositions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
