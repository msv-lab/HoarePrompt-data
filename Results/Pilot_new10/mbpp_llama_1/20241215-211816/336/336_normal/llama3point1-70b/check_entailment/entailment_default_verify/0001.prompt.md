You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function checks whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. The function iterates over the list using a for loop with the range of the list's length. Inside the loop, it checks two conditions:

1. `i % 2!= 0`: This condition checks if the current index `i` is an odd number.
2. `lst[i] % 2 == 0`: If the index is odd, this condition checks if the value at that index is an even number.

If both conditions are met (i.e., an odd index contains an even number), the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list does not meet the condition. If the loop completes without finding any such case, the function returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

The function handles all possible cases, including:

* Empty lists: The function will return `True` for an empty list because there are no odd indices to check.
* Lists with only one element: If the list has only one element and it's at an even index (index 0), the function will return `True` because there are no odd indices to check. If the list has only one element and it's at an odd index (which is not possible in Python), the function will still work correctly because it will check the index and the value.
* Lists with multiple elements: The function will correctly check each odd index and return `False` if it finds an even number at any odd index.

Since the function correctly handles all possible cases, I conclude that it is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers and returns True if no odd-indexed elements in the list have even values; otherwise, it returns False, covering all potential edge cases including empty lists and lists of varying lengths and compositions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
