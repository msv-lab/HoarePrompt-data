Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list and checks if it is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`. This approach correctly handles various edge cases, including:

- Empty lists: Since `sum` over an empty iterable returns 0, an empty list will correctly return 0.
- Lists with no integers: The `sum` of false values (which is what `isinstance(x, int)` returns for non-integers) is 0, so lists with no integers return 0.
- Lists with all integers: Every element in the list will satisfy `isinstance(x, int)`, contributing to the sum, thus correctly counting all integers.
- Lists with mixed data types: The `isinstance` check ensures that only integers are counted, ignoring other data types.

The output hints suggest the function handles these edge cases correctly, and upon examination, the code logic aligns with these expectations. Therefore, the function behaves as described in the problem statement for every potential case.
