Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem description asks to write a Python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.
2. The given function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as an argument, which can contain elements of any data type.
3. The function uses a generator expression with the `isinstance(x, int)` function to check if each element `x` in the list is an integer.
4. The `sum` function then adds up all the `True` values returned by `isinstance(x, int)`, effectively counting the number of integer elements in the list.

This approach is correct for several reasons:

* It correctly handles lists with elements of different data types, including integers, floats, strings, and other non-integer types.
* It correctly counts the number of integer elements in the list, regardless of their position or the presence of other data types.
* It uses a generator expression, which is memory-efficient and suitable for large lists.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description, and it does so in a way that handles all potential cases correctly. 

Example use cases:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 4]))  # Expected output: 4
print(func_1([1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 'a', 'b']))  # Expected output: 0
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Expected output: 5
print(func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']))  # Expected output: 0
```
