The provided Python function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integer elements in the list. This is achieved using a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function, which iterates over each element `x` in the list and checks if it's an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`. The `sum` function then adds up all the `True` values (which are equivalent to 1) to give the total count of integer elements.

The function handles various edge cases correctly:
- **Empty list**: If the list is empty, the generator expression will not iterate over any elements, and `sum` will return 0, which is the correct count of integer elements in an empty list.
- **List with no integers**: If the list contains no integer elements, `isinstance(x, int)` will always return `False` (equivalent to 0), and `sum` will return 0, indicating there are no integer elements.
- **List with all integers**: If all elements in the list are integers, `isinstance(x, int)` will always return `True` (equivalent to 1), and `sum` will return the total count of elements, which are all integers.
- **List with mixed data types**: For lists containing a mix of data types, `isinstance(x, int)` will correctly identify and count only the integer elements, ignoring elements of other data types.

Given that the function correctly counts the integer elements in the list under all these scenarios, and considering the problem description asks for a function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list, the provided function meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
