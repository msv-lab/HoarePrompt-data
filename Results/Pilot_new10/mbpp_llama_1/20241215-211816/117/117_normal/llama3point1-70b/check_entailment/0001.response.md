Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(lst)` returns the number of integer elements in a given list. This function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an instance of the `int` type using the `isinstance(x, int)` function. The `sum` function then adds up all the `True` values (which are treated as 1) and `False` values (which are treated as 0), effectively counting the number of integer elements in the list.

This function correctly handles various potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: `func_1([])` returns 0, which is correct.
- Lists with only integers: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns 3, which is correct.
- Lists with only non-integer elements: `func_1([1.0, 'a', True])` returns 1, because `True` is an instance of `int` in Python (although it's a boolean value, it's also considered an integer), but this is a subtlety of Python's type system.
- Lists with a mix of integer and non-integer elements: `func_1([1, 2.0, 'a', 3])` returns 3, which is incorrect due to the treatment of `True` and the implicit conversion of some types, but for the given example, the function works as expected because it counts `True` as an integer.

However, it's worth noting that this function will also count boolean values (`True` and `False`) as integers because in Python, `bool` is a subclass of `int`. This might not be the intended behavior in all cases, but based strictly on the problem description provided, which asks for a count of "integer elements" without specifying how to handle boolean values, the function operates correctly within the constraints of Python's type system.

The only potential issue could arise from the interpretation of what constitutes an "integer element," particularly regarding boolean values. But given the problem description and Python's type hierarchy, the function behaves as expected. Hence, without additional constraints or a more specific definition of "integer" that excludes boolean values, the function is correct.
