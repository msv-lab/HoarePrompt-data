Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It returns the number of integer elements in a given list.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

- The function takes a list `lst` as input and uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list.
- For each element `x`, it checks if `x` is an instance of `int` using the `isinstance(x, int)` function. This correctly identifies integer elements, including those that might be instances of subclasses of `int`.
- The `sum` function then adds up all the instances where `isinstance(x, int)` returns `True`, effectively counting the number of integer elements in the list.
- The function handles various cases correctly, including:
  - Empty lists: `func_1([])` returns `0`, as there are no integer elements.
  - Lists with no integers: `func_1(['a', 'b', 1.2])` returns `0`, because there are no integers in the list.
  - Lists with a mix of integers and other types: `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` returns `2`, correctly counting the two integer elements.
  - Lists with only integers: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `3`, as all elements are integers.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further validate the correctness of the function by covering different scenarios.

Overall, the function accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
