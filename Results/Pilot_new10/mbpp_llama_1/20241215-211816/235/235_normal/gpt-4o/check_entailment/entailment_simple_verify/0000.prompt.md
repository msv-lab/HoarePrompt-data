You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

I believe the code is correct because it handles the problem description accurately. The code calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer by using a while loop to continuously add the remainder of the number when divided by 10 (i.e., the last digit) to the total sum and then removing the last digit by performing integer division by 10. This process continues until the number becomes 0. 

Here are some example cases that demonstrate the correctness of the code:
- `func_1(345)` returns 12, which is the sum of the digits 3, 4, and 5.
- `func_1(12)` returns 3, which is the sum of the digits 1 and 2.
- `func_1(97)` returns 16, which is the sum of the digits 9 and 7.
- `func_1(0)` returns 0, which is the sum of the digits of 0 (i.e., there are no digits to sum).
- `func_1(1000)` returns 1, which is the sum of the digits of 1000.

I couldn't find a single case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct and should return the expected results for all non-negative integers.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `total` is the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`
    return total
    #The program returns 0


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
