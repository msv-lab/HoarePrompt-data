Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to store the sum of the digits.
2. The function enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
3. Inside the loop, the function calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 using the modulo operator (`n % 10`). This gives the last digit of the number.
4. The function adds the last digit to the `total`.
5. The function then performs integer division of `n` by 10 using the floor division operator (`n //= 10`). This effectively removes the last digit from the number.
6. Steps 3-5 repeat until `n` is 0.
7. Once `n` is 0, the loop ends, and the function returns the `total`, which now holds the sum of all the digits of the original number.

This process works for all non-negative integers, including single-digit numbers and numbers with multiple digits. The program handles all potential cases correctly, and the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate its correctness.

For example, if the input is `345`, the program calculates the sum as follows:

- `n` is 345, `total` is 0
- First iteration: `n % 10` is 5, `total` becomes 5, `n` becomes 34
- Second iteration: `n % 10` is 4, `total` becomes 9, `n` becomes 3
- Third iteration: `n % 10` is 3, `total` becomes 12, `n` becomes 0
- The loop ends, and the function returns 12, which is the correct sum of the digits.

This explanation and the provided unit tests demonstrate that the program always does what the problem description says, making it correct.
