The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The provided Python program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version of the code further supports this assessment by clearly describing the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

The function `func_1` initializes a variable `total` to 0, which accumulates the sum of the digits. It uses a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0, ensuring all digits of the input number are processed. Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`n % 10`), giving the last digit of the number, and adds it to `total`. After adding the last digit to `total`, it performs integer division of `n` by 10 (`n //= 10`), effectively removing the last digit from the number. This process repeats until `n` becomes 0, at which point all digits have been processed, and `total` contains the sum of all digits.

The annotated version of the code confirms this logic, stating that after the loop has been executed, `n` is 0, and `total` is the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`. This directly aligns with the problem description's requirement to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
