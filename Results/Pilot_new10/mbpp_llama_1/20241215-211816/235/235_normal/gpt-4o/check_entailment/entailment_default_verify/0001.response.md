To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description, the program itself, the original assessment, and the output hints.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input.
   - It initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of the digits of `n`.
   - The function enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop, it adds the last digit of `n` (obtained by `n % 10`) to `total` and then removes the last digit from `n` (by performing integer division of `n` by 10, `n //= 10`).
   - Once all digits have been processed (i.e., `n` becomes 0), the function returns `total`, which is the sum of the digits of the original input `n`.

3. **Original Assessment**: There is no original assessment provided, so we will rely solely on the program's code and the output hints to evaluate its correctness.

4. **Output Hints Analysis**:
   - The output hints state that the function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - Specifically, it mentions that if `n` is 0, the function returns 0, which aligns with the expected behavior for the sum of digits of a non-negative integer.

Given the program's logic and the output hints, the code seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. It handles the case for `n = 0` implicitly, as the while loop condition will be false, and the function will return 0 (the initial value of `total`), which is the expected behavior.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the strict format required for the answer:

Final: **True**
