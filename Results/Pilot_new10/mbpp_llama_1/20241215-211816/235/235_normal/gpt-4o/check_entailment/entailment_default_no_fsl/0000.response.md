Correctness: **True**

The given code correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's why:

- The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input and initializes a variable `total` to 0. This variable will store the sum of the digits of `n`.
- The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
- Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 using `n % 10`, which gives the last digit of the number, and adds this digit to `total`.
- It then uses integer division `n //= 10` to remove the last digit from `n`.
- Once `n` becomes 0, the loop ends, and the function returns `total`, which is the sum of all the digits of the original number.
- The code handles the case when `n` is 0 correctly, as the while loop will not execute, and the function will return 0, since the initial value of `total` is 0.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for several examples, including multi-digit numbers. Additionally, the function's logic is sound and covers all potential cases for non-negative integers, including 0. Therefore, the code works as expected for every potential case described in the problem description.
