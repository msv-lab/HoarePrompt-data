To assess the correctness of the program, let's first examine the problem description, which requires writing a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The original assessment is "None," indicating no initial judgment on the program's correctness.

The provided program defines a function `func_1(n: int) -> int` that takes a non-negative integer `n`, initializes a variable `total` to 0, and enters a while loop. Inside the loop, it adds the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`n % 10`, which gives the last digit of `n`) to `total` and then performs integer division of `n` by 10 (`n //= 10`, effectively removing the last digit of `n`). This process continues until `n` is 0.

The annotated version of the code describes the state of the program at different points. Before the function call, `n` is a non-negative integer. After the loop, `n` is 0, and `total` is the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`.

Given this information, the original assessment of "None" doesn't provide any insight into the program's correctness, so we cannot evaluate its accuracy based on the provided information. However, we can directly assess the program's correctness based on the problem description and the annotated version.

The program correctly implements the logic for summing the digits of a non-negative integer:
1. It iterates through each digit of the number (by using `n % 10` to get the last digit and `n //= 10` to remove the last digit).
2. It sums these digits (by adding `n % 10` to `total` in each iteration).
3. It continues this process until all digits have been processed (i.e., until `n` is 0).
4. Finally, it returns the total sum of the digits.

Therefore, the program accurately solves the problem as described. The annotations provided align with this analysis, confirming that the program behaves as expected.

Final: **True**
