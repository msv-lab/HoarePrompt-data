The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The code correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer by continuously adding the last digit of the number to the total sum and then removing the last digit.

The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment. It correctly describes the state of the program at different points, including the fact that `n` becomes 0 after the loop and `total` becomes the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`.

The use of the modulo operator (`n % 10`) to get the last digit of the number and integer division (`n //= 10`) to remove the last digit is a common and correct approach to solve this problem.

The test cases provided also demonstrate the correctness of the code, including edge cases like `func_1(0)` which returns 0 as expected.

Therefore, I believe the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
