You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

* The function `func_1` initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits.
* The function uses a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. This ensures that all digits of the input number are processed.
* Inside the loop, the program calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`n % 10`), which gives the last digit of the number. This digit is added to `total`.
* After adding the last digit to `total`, the program performs integer division of `n` by 10 (`n //= 10`), effectively removing the last digit from the number.
* This process repeats until `n` becomes 0, at which point all digits have been processed, and `total` contains the sum of all digits.
* The function then returns `total`, which is the sum of the digits of the input number.

All the provided assertions (`assert func_1(345) == 12`, `assert func_1(12) == 3`, `assert func_1(97) == 16`) are also correct based on the calculation.

Since the code correctly handles the sum of digits for non-negative integers and there are no obvious edge cases that it doesn't handle, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `total` is the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`
    return total
    #The program returns 0


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
