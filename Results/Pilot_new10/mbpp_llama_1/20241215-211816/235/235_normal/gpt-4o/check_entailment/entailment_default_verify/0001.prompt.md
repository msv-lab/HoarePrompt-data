You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

* The function `func_1` initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits.
* The function uses a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. This ensures that all digits of the input number are processed.
* Inside the loop, the program calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`n % 10`), which gives the last digit of the number. This digit is added to `total`.
* After adding the last digit to `total`, the program performs integer division of `n` by 10 (`n //= 10`), effectively removing the last digit from the number.
* This process repeats until `n` becomes 0, at which point all digits have been processed, and `total` contains the sum of all digits.
* The function then returns `total`, which is the sum of the digits of the input number.

All the provided assertions (`assert func_1(345) == 12`, `assert func_1(12) == 3`, `assert func_1(97) == 16`) are also correct based on the calculation.

Since the code correctly handles the sum of digits for non-negative integers and there are no obvious edge cases that it doesn't handle, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
