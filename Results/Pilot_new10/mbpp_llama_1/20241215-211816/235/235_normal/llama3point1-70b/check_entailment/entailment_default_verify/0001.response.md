The original assessment is **True** because the provided code correctly implements the function to calculate the sum of digits of a non-negative integer as per the problem description. The code works as follows:

1. It converts the integer into a string, which allows it to iterate over each digit.
2. It uses a generator expression to convert each character (digit) back into an integer.
3. Finally, it sums up these integers using the built-in `sum` function.

The output hints suggest that the code might not handle cases like negative integers, non-integers, or non-numeric inputs correctly. However, the problem statement explicitly mentions that the function should work for non-negative integers, and we are assuming that the input will always be valid. 

Therefore, given the constraints of the problem and the assumption of valid input, the original assessment is accurate. The code does what it's supposed to do within the boundaries set by the problem description.

Final: **True**
