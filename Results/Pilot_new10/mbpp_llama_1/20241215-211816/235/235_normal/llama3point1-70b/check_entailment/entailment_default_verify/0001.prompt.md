You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets the requirements stated in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.

Here's why the code is correct:

- The function converts the integer into a string using `str(n)`. This allows it to iterate over each character (digit) in the string.
- It then uses a generator expression `(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` to convert each character (digit) back into an integer and generate a sequence of these integers.
- Finally, it uses the built-in `sum` function to add up all the integers in the sequence, effectively calculating the sum of the digits.

The code handles non-negative integers as required, including single-digit numbers (e.g., `func_1(5)` returns `5`), multi-digit numbers (e.g., `func_1(123)` returns `1+2+3 = 6`), and zero (e.g., `func_1(0)` correctly returns `0` because the sum of no digits is zero).

Since all potential cases of non-negative integers are handled correctly by the function, and it accurately calculates the sum of the digits for any given non-negative integer, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, calculates the sum of its digits, and returns this sum as a non-negative integer. However, it does not include error checking for negative integers, non-integers, or non-numeric inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if such inputs are provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
