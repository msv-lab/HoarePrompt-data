The original assessment is "None", indicating that no initial evaluation was provided. Based on the problem description, the program is designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. 

The annotated version of the code clarifies the state of the program before the function call and after its execution. It states that `n` is a non-negative integer before the function call and that the program returns the sum of the digits of `n` after the execution.

Upon examining the provided code:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
```
This function works as expected for non-negative integers. It converts the integer into a string, then iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts it back into an integer, and sums all these digits together.

Given the information and the annotations, the program correctly implements the function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Therefore, the original assessment, even though it's "None", does not contradict the program's correctness. The annotated version confirms the program's correctness as it outlines the expected input and output states without introducing any discrepancies.

Final: **True**
