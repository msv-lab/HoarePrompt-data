The original assessment is None, which implies that no evaluation has been made regarding the program's correctness. 

Upon examining the problem description and the provided code, it's clear that the code is designed to calculate the sum of digits of a non-negative integer. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n`, converts it into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts each character back into an integer, and sums them up.

The output hints suggest that the function works as intended for its specified purpose but lacks error checking for inputs that do not match the expected non-negative integer type. 

However, the problem statement and the output hints assume that the input will be valid, meaning it will be a non-negative integer. Under this assumption, the function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of the input integer.

Therefore, considering the specified problem and the assumption of valid input, the original assessment of None can be updated to reflect that the program is indeed correct based on its intended functionality and the constraints provided.

Final: **True**
