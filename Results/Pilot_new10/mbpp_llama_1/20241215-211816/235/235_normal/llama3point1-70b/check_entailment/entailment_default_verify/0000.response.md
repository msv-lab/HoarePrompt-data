The original assessment concludes that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` is correct based on the problem description, which asks for a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The assessment provides detailed reasoning for why the function works correctly for various cases, including non-negativity, conversion to a string, summation, and edge cases like zero, single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and large numbers.

The output hints support the functionality of the code, indicating that it calculates and returns the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer as expected. However, they also mention the lack of error checking for negative integers, non-integers, or non-numeric inputs, which could lead to issues if such inputs are provided.

Given that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program (i.e., the input will always be a non-negative integer), the original assessment is accurate in concluding that the function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of any non-negative integer. The lack of error checking for invalid inputs does not affect the correctness of the function for its intended, valid inputs.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, with the understanding that valid inputs are assumed, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
