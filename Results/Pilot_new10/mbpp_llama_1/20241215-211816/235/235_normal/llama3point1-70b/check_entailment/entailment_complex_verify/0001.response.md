The original assessment is "None", indicating that no initial judgment was made about the correctness of the program. 

Given the problem description, the program is supposed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes an integer `n`, converts it to a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up.

The annotated version of the code confirms this understanding and provides additional context. It points out that the function does not include error checking for negative integers, non-integers, or non-numeric inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if such inputs are provided.

However, the problem description explicitly states that we are assuming the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, within the context of this assumption, the program correctly achieves its intended purpose: it calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer without any issues.

Based on the provided information and the assumption that the input will always be valid (a non-negative integer), the program functions as intended. Therefore, the assessment of the program's correctness, given the constraints and assumptions provided, would be that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
