To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to check if it accurately calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer as described in the problem statement.

The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of its digits. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Conversion to String**: The integer `n` is converted to a string using `str(n)`. This allows the function to iterate over each digit of the number, as strings in Python are iterable, with each character being a separate element.

2. **Iteration and Conversion Back to Integer**: For each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`, the function converts it back to an integer using `int(digit)`. This is necessary because the `sum` function requires numerical values to calculate the sum.

3. **Summation**: The `sum` function then adds up all the integer digits, effectively calculating the sum of the digits of the original number `n`.

Given this process, let's analyze the correctness of the function based on the problem description:

- **Non-Negative Integer Input**: The function does not explicitly check if the input `n` is a non-negative integer. However, the problem description guarantees that `n` will be a non-negative integer. In Python, without explicit type checking, it's assumed that the input matches the problem's constraints. Thus, under the given problem constraints, the function operates correctly.

- **Correctness for Zero**: The function should also handle the case where `n = 0` correctly. Since `str(0)` is `'0'`, `int('0')` equals `0`, and the sum of no elements (or a single element `0`) is `0`, the function behaves correctly for this edge case.

- **Correctness for Positive Integers**: For any positive integer, the function will iterate over each digit, convert it to an integer, and sum these values. This perfectly aligns with the task of summing the digits of a non-negative integer.

Given these considerations, it appears that the function does exactly what the problem description asks for, under the assumption that the input will always be a non-negative integer as specified.

Correctness: **True**
