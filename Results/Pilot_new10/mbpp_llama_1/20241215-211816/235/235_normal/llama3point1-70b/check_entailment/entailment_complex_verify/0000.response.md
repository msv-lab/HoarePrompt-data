To determine the final correctness of the program, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
2. **Original Program**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))
   ```
   This function takes an integer `n`, converts it into a string to iterate over each digit, converts each digit back into an integer, and then sums these digits.

3. **Original Assessment**: None. There's no initial assessment to evaluate against.

4. **Annotated Version**: The annotations clarify the function's behavior and its expectations. It explicitly states that the function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, calculates the sum of its digits, and returns this sum. However, it also notes the absence of error checking for cases where `n` might be negative, not an integer, or not a numeric input.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, the program does indeed perform the task it is supposed to do: it takes a non-negative integer and returns the sum of its digits. The absence of error checking for negative integers or non-integer inputs is noted, but since the problem statement assumes the input will be valid (a non-negative integer), this does not affect the program's correctness in the context of the given problem description.

The program is designed with the assumption that the input will always be valid, and under this assumption, it correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given non-negative integer.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the provided code, and the assumption of valid input, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
