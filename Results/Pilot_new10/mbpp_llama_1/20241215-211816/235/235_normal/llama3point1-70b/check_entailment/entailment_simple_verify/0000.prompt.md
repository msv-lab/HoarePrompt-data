You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It achieves this by first converting the integer into a string, then iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting it back into an integer, and summing these up.

Here's why this function works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Non-negativity**: The function does not explicitly check for non-negativity, but in Python, attempting to convert a negative number to a string and then iterating over its digits would still technically work, though it would include the negative sign as a character, not a digit. However, the problem description and common mathematical interpretation assume non-negative integers for such operations, meaning inputs should not include the negative sign. For any non-negative integer, the function should work as expected.

2. **Conversion to String**: Converting an integer to a string allows for easy iteration over each digit, which is then converted back to an integer for summation. This approach correctly handles integers of any length.

3. **Summation**: The `sum` function with a generator expression is an efficient way to add up all the digits.

Potential edge cases to consider:

- **Zero**: The function should handle the input `0` correctly. Since `str(0)` is `'0'`, and `int('0')` is `0`, the sum is correctly `0`.

- **Single-digit numbers**: For any single-digit number `n`, `str(n)` will be a string of length 1, and `int(str(n))` returns `n` itself. Thus, the function works for single-digit inputs.

- **Multi-digit numbers**: The function also correctly handles multi-digit numbers by iterating over each character in the string representation of the number and summing them up.

- **Large numbers**: Python can handle arbitrarily large integers, so the function should work for large inputs as well, limited only by available memory.

Given the provided code and the problem description, it seems the function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of any non-negative integer. Thus, without being able to find a case where the function does not work as expected, it is reasonable to conclude that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of `n`, which is a non-negative integer.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
