The function accepts three parameters b, h, and l, and returns their product divided by 2, which corresponds to the volume of a triangular prism if b, h, and l represent non-negative base length, height, and length respectively; however, it does not validate the non-negativity of the inputs and will return a value for any real numbers b, h, and l, including negative numbers and zero.
