The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`, where `b` is the base length of the triangular prism, `h` is the height of the triangular base, and `l` is the length of the prism. All parameters are non-negative numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns the volume of the triangular prism, which is calculated as the product of the area of the triangular base and the length of the prism. The area of the base is calculated as `(base length * height) / 2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three non-negative parameters b, h, and l, and returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as 0.5 * b * h * l.**
