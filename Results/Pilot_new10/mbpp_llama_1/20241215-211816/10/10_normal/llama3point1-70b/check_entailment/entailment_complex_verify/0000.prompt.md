You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Program:
```
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `(base area) * height`, where the base area is `(base * height) / 2` for a triangle. In this case, the function multiplies the base `b`, the height of the triangle `h`, and the length `l` of the prism, and divides by 2 to calculate the volume of the triangular prism. 

This function appears to be correct for all potential cases. The formula used in the function accurately represents the volume of a triangular prism, and it handles all possible inputs correctly, assuming that the inputs are non-negative numbers. 

For example, if you call `func_1(5, 6, 7)`, it will return the correct volume of a triangular prism with a base of 5 units, a triangle height of 6 units, and a length of 7 units. 

There are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. It will work correctly for triangular prisms with any non-negative base, triangle height, and length.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, h, and l are non-negative numbers where b is the base length of the triangular prism, h is the height of the triangular base, and l is the length of the prism.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism, which is the product of the area of the triangular base and the length of the prism, where the area of the base is calculated as (base length * height) / 2 and base length, height, and length are non-negative numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters b, h, and l, and returns their product divided by 2, which corresponds to the volume of a triangular prism if b, h, and l represent non-negative base length, height, and length respectively; however, it does not validate the non-negativity of the inputs and will return a value for any real numbers b, h, and l, including negative numbers and zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
