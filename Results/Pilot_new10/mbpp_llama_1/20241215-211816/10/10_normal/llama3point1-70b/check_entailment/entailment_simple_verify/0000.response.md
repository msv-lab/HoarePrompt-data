The problem description requires a function to calculate the volume of a triangular prism. The volume of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula: Volume = Area of base * Length, where the area of the base (a triangle) is calculated as (base * height) / 2.

The provided code defines a function `func_1(b, h, l)` that takes three parameters: `b` (base length), `h` (height of the triangular base), and `l` (length of the prism). The function returns the product of `b`, `h`, divided by 2, and then multiplied by `l`, which correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism.

The original assessment is "None", meaning there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

The annotated version of the code explains the state of the program before the function call and after the return statement, confirming that the function indeed calculates the volume of the triangular prism as intended.

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the function correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
