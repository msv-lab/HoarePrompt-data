Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is the product of the area of the triangular base and the length of the prism. The area of the triangular base is calculated as `(base length * height) / 2`, which is correctly implemented in the function as `b * h / 2`. This result is then multiplied by the length of the prism `l`, giving the correct formula for the volume of the triangular prism.

The function takes into account the constraints specified in the problem description, where `b`, `h`, and `l` are non-negative numbers representing the base length, height of the triangular base, and length of the prism, respectively. The function will return the correct volume for any valid input that meets these constraints.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
