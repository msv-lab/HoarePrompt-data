Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code is designed to calculate the volume of a triangular prism. The volume of a triangular prism is calculated as the area of the base times the length. The area of the base is calculated as 0.5 times the product of the base and the height. The code correctly implements this formula. The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `base`, `height`, and `length`, and returns the volume calculated as 0.5 times the product of the base and the height, times the length. The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(10, 8, 6) == 240` and `assert func_1(3, 2, 2) == 6`, also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected. The code does not include any validation or error handling for non-positive input values, but based on the problem description and the provided output hints, it seems to be intended to work with positive input values. Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
