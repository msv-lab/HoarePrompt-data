The function accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, calculates the non-negative distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` and the angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`, and returns these values; however, it may produce incorrect results for invalid input values such as `NaN` or infinity, and it assumes that the input values are real numbers without performing any error checking.
