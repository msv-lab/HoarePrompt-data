You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(3, 4) == (5.0, 0.9272952180016122)
assert func_1(4, 7) == (8.06225774829855, 1.0516502125483738)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (22.67156809750927, 0.8478169733934057)

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, theta)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It accurately converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates, and returns a tuple containing the radius `r` and the angle `theta` in polar coordinates.

The program correctly calculates the radius using the Pythagorean theorem (`r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`) and the angle using the `math.atan2` function (`theta = math.atan2(y, x)`). The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error.

The program also handles negative values of `x` and `y` correctly, as the `math.atan2` function takes into account the sign of both `x` and `y` when calculating the angle.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the program for different input values.

After analyzing the program and considering different potential cases, I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, calculates the non-negative distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` and the angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`, and returns these values; however, it may produce incorrect results for invalid input values such as `NaN` or infinity, and it assumes that the input values are real numbers without performing any error checking.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
