The original assessment was "None", indicating that no assessment was made. However, after reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I can see that the code accurately implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.

The annotated version of the code correctly describes the state of the program before the function call, where `x` and `y` are real numbers. The function `func_1` then calculates the distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` using the Pythagorean theorem, and the angle `theta` from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)` using the `atan2` function.

The function returns the correct values for `r` and `theta`, as evidenced by the provided assertions. The `math.sqrt` function correctly calculates the distance, and the `math.atan2` function correctly calculates the angle in radians.

Based on this analysis, I believe that the original assessment of "None" should be updated to reflect the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
