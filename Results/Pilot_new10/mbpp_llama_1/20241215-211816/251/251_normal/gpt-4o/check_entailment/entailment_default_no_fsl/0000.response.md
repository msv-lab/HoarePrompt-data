Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not handle every potential case correctly. The program assumes that the input values are real numbers and does not perform any error checking. However, if the input values are `NaN` (Not a Number) or infinity, the program may produce incorrect results. 

For example, if we pass `float('inf')` or `float('nan')` as input to the `func_1` function, it will produce incorrect results or raise an exception. The `math.sqrt` and `math.atan2` functions in Python do not handle these cases correctly.

To make the program correct, it should include error checking code to handle these cases and raise informative error messages or return special values to indicate that the input is invalid. 

Additionally, the problem description does not mention how to handle complex input values. The program assumes that the input values are real numbers, but the problem description does not explicitly state this. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to handle these cases:
```python
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    if not isinstance(x, (int, float)) or not isinstance(y, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Input values must be real numbers")
    if math.isnan(x) or math.isnan(y):
        raise ValueError("Input values cannot be NaN")
    if math.isinf(x) or math.isinf(y):
        raise ValueError("Input values cannot be infinity")
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, theta)
```
This modified program checks the input values to ensure they are real numbers and not `NaN` or infinity, and raises informative error messages if they are not valid.
