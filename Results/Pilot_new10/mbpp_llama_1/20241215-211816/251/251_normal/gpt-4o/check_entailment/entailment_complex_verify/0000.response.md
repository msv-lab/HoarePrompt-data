The original assessment is "None", indicating that no initial correctness assessment was provided. 

After reviewing the provided code and the annotated version, it can be observed that the function `func_1` accurately implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` and `theta = atan2(y, x)`. 

The annotated version of the code provides insights into the state of the program at different points and describes the function's behavior, which aligns with the problem description. It also mentions potential issues with invalid input values such as `NaN` or infinity, but since we assume that the input will be valid, these issues do not affect the correctness of the program.

Considering all the information available, the program seems to be correct based on the problem description. The function correctly calculates the polar coordinates from the given rectangular coordinates.

Final: **True**
