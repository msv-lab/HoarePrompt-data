The original assessment states that the provided Python function, `func_1`, appears to be correct in converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. This assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. 

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the radial distance `r` using `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)` and the angle `theta` using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which handles the case where `x` is 0. The function returns a tuple containing `r` and `theta`, which is consistent with the problem description.

The annotated version of the code also supports the original assessment, describing the correct calculation of `r` and `theta` and the return of these values. Although it mentions potential issues with invalid input values such as `NaN` or infinity, this is not a concern based on the problem description, which assumes valid input.

Given that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the `func_1` function is correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
