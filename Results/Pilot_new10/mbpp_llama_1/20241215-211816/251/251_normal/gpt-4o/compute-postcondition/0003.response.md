The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of which are real numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns two values: `r`, the non-negative distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)` in the Cartesian plane, and `theta`, the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, both real numbers, and returns the non-negative distance r from the origin to the point (x, y) and the angle theta in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y).**
