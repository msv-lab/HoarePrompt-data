The code calculates the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. 

`r` is assigned the value of `math.hypot(x, y)`, which is equivalent to `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`. 

The states of `x` and `y` are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is equal to `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is equal to `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`**
