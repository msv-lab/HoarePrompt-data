You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, phi)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is a function that converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1(x, y)` takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point. It then calculates the corresponding polar coordinates, `r` (radial distance) and `phi` (azimuthal angle), using the following formulas:

- `r = math.hypot(x, y)`: This calculates the distance of the point from the origin using the Euclidean norm.
- `phi = math.atan2(y, x)`: This calculates the angle of the point from the positive x-axis in the counterclockwise direction.

The use of `math.atan2(y, x)` instead of `math.atan(y/x)` is crucial here because it correctly handles the cases where `x` is zero (which would result in a division by zero error if `math.atan(y/x)` were used) and also handles the quadrant of the point correctly.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:
- When the point is at the origin (0, 0), where `r` is correctly calculated as 0, and `phi` can be any value but `math.atan2(0, 0)` returns 0.
- When the point is on the positive x-axis, where `phi` is correctly calculated as 0.
- When the point is on the positive y-axis, where `phi` is correctly calculated as π/2.
- When the point is in any of the four quadrants, where `phi` is correctly calculated to be in the range [-π, π].
- When the point has negative coordinates, where the calculations for `r` and `phi` are still correct.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program seems to correctly convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates for all possible inputs. Therefore, without any found edge cases that the code does not handle according to the description, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, calculates and returns the polar coordinates (`r`, `phi`) of the point (`x`, `y`), where `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin and `phi` is the angle from the positive x-axis in radians, handling edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero, infinity, or NaN.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
