The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the polar coordinates (`r`, `phi`) of a point (`x`, `y`) using the `math.hypot` and `math.atan2` functions, handling edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function calculates and returns the polar coordinates (`r`, `phi`) of the point (`x`, `y`), where `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin and `phi` is the angle from the positive x-axis in radians. The annotations also highlight that the function handles edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero, infinity, or NaN, although the handling of these cases is implicit in the use of `math.hypot` and `math.atan2`.

One potential issue with the function is that it does not explicitly handle cases where `x` or `y` is NaN (Not a Number) or infinity. However, the `math.hypot` and `math.atan2` functions are designed to handle these cases correctly, returning NaN or infinity as appropriate.

Overall, the original assessment is accurate, and the annotated version of the code confirms that the function correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.

Final: **True**.
