The original assessment is None, which means there was no initial assessment of the program's correctness. 

After reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the program is correct. The code accurately implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the `math.hypot` function to calculate the Euclidean distance (`r`) and the `math.atan2` function to calculate the angle (`phi`) in radians.

The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of the state of the program at different points and confirms that the function correctly handles edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero, infinity, or NaN.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
