You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, phi)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It uses the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radial distance `r` and the `math.atan2` function to calculate the angle `phi`. 

The `math.hypot` function calculates the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the input values, and is equivalent to the formula `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`. This is the correct formula for calculating the radial distance in polar coordinates.

The `math.atan2` function calculates the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`. It handles the case where `x` is zero correctly, which is important because the `math.atan` function does not.

The function handles all possible input cases, including:

- The origin (0, 0), where `r` is 0 and `phi` is arbitrary, though `math.atan2(0, 0)` returns 0.
- The positive x-axis, where `y` is 0 and `phi` is 0.
- The negative x-axis, where `y` is 0 and `phi` is `pi`.
- The positive y-axis, where `x` is 0 and `phi` is `pi/2`.
- The negative y-axis, where `x` is 0 and `phi` is `-pi/2`.
- All other points in the plane, where `x` and `y` are non-zero.

In all these cases, the function should return the correct polar coordinates. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, phi
    #The program returns `r`, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, and `phi`, which is the arctangent of `y` divided by `x` in radians.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
