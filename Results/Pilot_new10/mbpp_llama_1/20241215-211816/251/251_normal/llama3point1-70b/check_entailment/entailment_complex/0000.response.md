Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates as described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Calculation of `r`**: The program uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the Euclidean distance from the origin, which is the correct formula for `r` in polar coordinates. This handles edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero, infinity, or NaN.

2. **Calculation of `phi`**: The program uses `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle from the positive x-axis in radians. This function correctly handles the quadrant of the angle and edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero.

3. **Handling of edge cases**: The `math.atan2` function correctly handles edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero, infinity, or NaN. For example, when `x` is zero, `math.atan2` returns `π/2` when `y` is positive and `-π/2` when `y` is negative.

4. **Return values**: The program returns `r` and `phi` as described in the problem description, which are the polar coordinates of the point `(x, y)`.

In summary, the program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, handling all edge cases and returning the correct values for `r` and `phi`. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the correctness is **True**.
