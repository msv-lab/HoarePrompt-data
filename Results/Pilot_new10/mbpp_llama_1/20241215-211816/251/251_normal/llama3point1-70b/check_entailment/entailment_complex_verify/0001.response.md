Based on the provided information, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The program correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, handling edge cases such as points on the x-axis, y-axis, and the origin. The use of `math.hypot(x, y)` and `math.atan2(y, x)` ensures accurate calculations for the radial distance and azimuthal angle, respectively.

The annotated version of the code also confirms this assessment, as it correctly describes the calculations performed by the program and the handling of edge cases. The annotations make sense and do not reveal any issues with the program's correctness.

One potential concern is that the program does not explicitly handle cases where the input coordinates are invalid (e.g., complex numbers, non-numeric values). However, as stated in the problem description, it is assumed that the input will be valid, so this is not considered a correctness issue.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the original assessment of Correctness: **True** appears to be accurate.

Final: **True**
