You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, phi)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It uses the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radial distance `r` and the `math.atan2` function to calculate the angle `phi`. 

The `math.hypot` function calculates the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the input values, and is equivalent to the formula `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`. This is the correct formula for calculating the radial distance in polar coordinates.

The `math.atan2` function calculates the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`. It handles the case where `x` is zero correctly, which is important because the `math.atan` function does not.

The function handles all possible input cases, including:

- The origin (0, 0), where `r` is 0 and `phi` is arbitrary, though `math.atan2(0, 0)` returns 0.
- The positive x-axis, where `y` is 0 and `phi` is 0.
- The negative x-axis, where `y` is 0 and `phi` is `pi`.
- The positive y-axis, where `x` is 0 and `phi` is `pi/2`.
- The negative y-axis, where `x` is 0 and `phi` is `-pi/2`.
- All other points in the plane, where `x` and `y` are non-zero.

In all these cases, the function should return the correct polar coordinates. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, calculates and returns the polar coordinates (`r`, `phi`) of the point (`x`, `y`), where `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin and `phi` is the angle from the positive x-axis in radians, handling edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero, infinity, or NaN.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
