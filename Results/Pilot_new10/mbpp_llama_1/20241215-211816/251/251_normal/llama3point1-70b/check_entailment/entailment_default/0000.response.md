Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(x, y)` accurately converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, phi)`. Here's why:

1. **Calculation of `r`**: The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin. This is the correct approach, as `math.hypot(x, y)` returns the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, which is equivalent to the Euclidean norm.

2. **Calculation of `phi`**: The function uses `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle `phi` from the positive x-axis in radians. `math.atan2(y, x)` is specifically designed to handle the conversion of rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, taking into account the signs of `x` and `y` to determine the correct quadrant for `phi`.

3. **Handling edge cases**: The function handles edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero, infinity, or NaN correctly:
   - When `x` is zero and `y` is positive, `phi` will be π/2 (or 90 degrees), and when `y` is negative, `phi` will be -π/2 (or -90 degrees), as expected.
   - When `y` is zero, `phi` will be 0 if `x` is positive and π if `x` is negative, as expected.
   - For infinite or NaN input values, the behavior is determined by the `math` library's handling of such values, which should follow IEEE 754 floating-point standards for handling these special values.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function correctly calculates and returns the polar coordinates `(r, phi)` of the point `(x, y)`, handling various edge cases.

Therefore, based on the given information and analysis, the code correctly implements the conversion of rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates for all potential cases.
