To assess the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the output hints, we first need to understand what the program is intended to do and what it actually does.

The problem description asks for a function to convert rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates. The polar coordinates are represented by \(r\), the radius or distance from the origin to the point, and \(\phi\), the angle from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to the point, measured in radians.

The provided program, `func_1`, takes two real numbers `x` and `y` as input and returns a tuple `(r, phi)`. Here's how it calculates these values:
- `r` is calculated using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which returns the Euclidean norm, \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), of the given coordinates. This correctly calculates the distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the origin.
- `phi` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point \((x, y)\). This function correctly handles the quadrant that the point is in based on the signs of `x` and `y`.

Given the original assessment is "None", we need to evaluate the program's correctness based on the problem description and output hints.

The output hints suggest that the function should handle edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero, infinity, or NaN (Not a Number), and still calculate the polar coordinates correctly.

Looking at the code:
- For zero values of `x` or `y`, `math.hypot` and `math.atan2` are defined and will return correct results. For example, if `x` is zero and `y` is positive, `math.atan2(y, x)` returns \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), which is correct.
- For infinity values of `x` or `y`, `math.hypot` and `math.atan2` are designed to handle these cases correctly, returning infinity for `r` if either `x` or `y` is infinite, and the correct angle \(\phi\) based on the signs and values of `x` and `y`.
- For NaN values of `x` or `y`, both `math.hypot` and `math.atan2` will propagate the NaN, meaning if either `x` or `y` is NaN, the result for both `r` and `phi` will be NaN, which is consistent with the expectation that NaN inputs lead to NaN outputs.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, the original assessment of "None" implies a lack of evaluation, but our analysis indicates that the program does correctly implement the conversion from rectangular to polar coordinates and handles the specified edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
