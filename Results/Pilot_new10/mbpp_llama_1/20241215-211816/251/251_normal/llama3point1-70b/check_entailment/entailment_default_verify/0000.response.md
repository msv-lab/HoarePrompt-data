The original assessment and the output hints both confirm that the provided Python function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function uses the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radial distance `r` and the `math.atan2` function to calculate the angle `phi`. 

The original assessment correctly identifies the function's ability to handle various edge cases, including the origin, positive and negative x-axis, and positive and negative y-axis. The output hints also confirm that the function accepts two real numbers `x` and `y` and returns the polar coordinates (`r`, `phi`), handling edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero.

However, the original assessment does not explicitly consider the case where `x` or `y` is infinity or NaN, but the output hints do suggest that the function should handle these cases. 

Upon closer inspection, we can see that the `math.hypot` function and the `math.atan2` function both handle these edge cases correctly. 

The `math.hypot` function returns infinity if either `x` or `y` is infinity, and NaN if either `x` or `y` is NaN.

The `math.atan2` function returns a finite result if `y` is finite and `x` is infinity, and NaN if `x` or `y` is NaN.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, the original assessment that the function is correct is indeed accurate.

Final: **True**
