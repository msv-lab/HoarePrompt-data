Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list. Here's why it works:

- It initializes an empty list `flat_list` to store the flattened elements.
- It then iterates over each element `i` in the input `nested_list`.
- If `i` is a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on `i` and extends `flat_list` with the result, effectively flattening any nested lists.
- If `i` is not a list (i.e., it's an integer), it simply appends `i` to `flat_list`.
- After processing all elements in `nested_list`, it returns `flat_list`, which contains the flattened elements of the original list.

This approach ensures that every nested list, regardless of its depth, is properly flattened. The recursive call to `func_1` allows it to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth, and the use of `extend` instead of `append` when dealing with nested lists ensures that the inner lists are properly flattened rather than being added as single elements.

For example, given the input `[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]]`, the function will correctly return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, demonstrating its ability to handle nested lists of varying depths.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the function described in the problem statement, making it correct for all potential cases.
