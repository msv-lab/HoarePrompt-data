You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list. The function uses recursion to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth.

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. The function checks each element in the input list to determine if it's a list or not.
2. If an element is a list, the function calls itself with that element as the new input list, effectively flattening the nested list.
3. If an element is not a list, it's appended to the `flat_list`.
4. The function returns the `flat_list`, which contains all the elements from the original nested list, but in a flattened structure.

I've considered various potential cases, such as:

* An empty input list: The function returns an empty list, which is correct.
* A list with only one element: The function returns a list with that single element, which is correct.
* A list with multiple elements, including nested lists: The function correctly flattens the nested lists and returns a single list with all the elements.
* A list with deeply nested lists: The function's recursive approach allows it to handle lists of arbitrary depth.

Since I couldn't find any cases where the program doesn't work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, and returns a new list with all elements flattened to the top level, handling lists of arbitrary depth and including all types of elements found in the original list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
