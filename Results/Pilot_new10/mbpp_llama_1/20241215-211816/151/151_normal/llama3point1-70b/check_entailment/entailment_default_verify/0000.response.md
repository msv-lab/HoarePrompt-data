Based on the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, I have evaluated the correctness of the program.

The original assessment states that the program is correct, and I agree with this assessment. The provided code defines a recursive function `func_1` that correctly flattens a given nested list structure. The function handles lists of arbitrary depth, includes all types of elements found in the original list, and does not modify the original list.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and returning a new list with all elements flattened to the top level.

I did not find any discrepancies between the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints that would suggest the original assessment is inaccurate. The function correctly handles the cases described in the problem description and produces the expected output.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
