Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. 

The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list. The function uses recursion to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth. The output hints summarize the code functionality and indicate that the function accepts a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, and returns a new list with all elements flattened to the top level, handling lists of arbitrary depth and including all types of elements found in the original list.

The provided code correctly handles various potential cases, such as an empty input list, a list with only one element, a list with multiple elements, including nested lists, and a list with deeply nested lists. The recursive approach allows it to handle lists of arbitrary depth.

The original assessment also correctly identifies the key steps in the function's operation, including checking each element in the input list, handling nested lists, and appending non-list elements to the `flat_list`.

The output hints do not reveal any cases where the program does not work as expected, and they are consistent with the problem description and the provided code.

Therefore, I do not see any reason to change the original assessment.

Final: **True**
