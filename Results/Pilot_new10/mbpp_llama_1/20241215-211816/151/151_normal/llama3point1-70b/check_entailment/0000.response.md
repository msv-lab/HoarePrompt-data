Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively iterates through each element in the input list. If an element is a list itself, the function calls itself with that sublist as the argument and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends that element to the `flat_list`.

This approach correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and any type of elements that are not lists, including integers, strings, etc. It does not modify the original list and produces a new flattened list as output, which meets the typical expectations for such a function.

Here's a breakdown of why this function is considered correct:

1. **Recursive Handling of Nested Lists:** The function correctly identifies nested lists and applies itself to these sublists, leading to the proper flattening of the structure.

2. **Handling of Non-List Elements:** Elements that are not lists are directly appended to the `flat_list`, ensuring they are included in the output without modification.

3. **Generic Applicability:** The function does not assume any specific type of non-list elements, making it applicable to lists containing a mix of data types.

4. **No Modification of Original List:** The function creates a new `flat_list` and does not modify the original nested list, which is typically a desired behavior to avoid side effects.

Since this function correctly flattens any given nested list structure without any identified edge cases where it fails to perform as described, it is considered correct.
