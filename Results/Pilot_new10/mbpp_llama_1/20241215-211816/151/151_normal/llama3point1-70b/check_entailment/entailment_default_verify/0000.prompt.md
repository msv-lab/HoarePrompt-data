You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively iterates through each element in the input list. If an element is a list itself, the function calls itself with that sublist as the argument and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends that element to the `flat_list`.

This approach correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and any type of elements that are not lists, including integers, strings, etc. It does not modify the original list and produces a new flattened list as output, which meets the typical expectations for such a function.

Here's a breakdown of why this function is considered correct:

1. **Recursive Handling of Nested Lists:** The function correctly identifies nested lists and applies itself to these sublists, leading to the proper flattening of the structure.

2. **Handling of Non-List Elements:** Elements that are not lists are directly appended to the `flat_list`, ensuring they are included in the output without modification.

3. **Generic Applicability:** The function does not assume any specific type of non-list elements, making it applicable to lists containing a mix of data types.

4. **No Modification of Original List:** The function creates a new `flat_list` and does not modify the original nested list, which is typically a desired behavior to avoid side effects.

Since this function correctly flattens any given nested list structure without any identified edge cases where it fails to perform as described, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, and returns a new list with all elements flattened to the top level, handling lists of arbitrary depth and including all types of elements found in the original list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
