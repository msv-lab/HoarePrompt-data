To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop iterates over `nested_list`, and the loop variable is `i`. For the loop to execute, `nested_list` must have at least one element. The state of `flat_list` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop directly, but it's part of the overall state.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least one element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`**
