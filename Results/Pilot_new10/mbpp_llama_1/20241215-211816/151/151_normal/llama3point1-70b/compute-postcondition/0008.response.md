To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

Given that `i` is the second element in `nested_list` and the initial state conditions regarding `flat_list` based on whether `i` is a list or not, the code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` implies that `flat_list` will be extended with the result of `func_1(i)`, regardless of whether `i` is a list or not.

Since `func_1(i)` is applied to `i` directly in the code, and there's no conditional check in this specific code snippet to differentiate the handling of `i` based on it being a list or not, we must consider the effects of this operation under both scenarios as per the initial conditions.

1. **If `i` is a list:** Initially, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. After executing `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))`, `flat_list` will contain its original elements (which are the result of `func_1(i)`) plus the new elements resulting from `func_1(i)`. Essentially, it appends another set of elements returned by `func_1(i)` to itself.

2. **If `i` is not a list:** Initially, `flat_list` contains `i` as its element. After executing `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))`, `flat_list` will still contain `i`, and in addition, it will also contain the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.

In both cases, `nested_list` remains unchanged as the operation is on `flat_list` and `i`. The value of `i` also remains unchanged.

So, the output state reflects that `nested_list` is a list with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `nested_list`, and `flat_list` has been extended by the result of `func_1(i)`, regardless of whether `i` was initially a list or a single element.

Given the operation, if `i` was a list, `flat_list` now contains twice the elements it initially had from `func_1(i)` (considering the initial state condition for a list). If `i` was not a list, `flat_list` now includes its original element `i` plus the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.

Thus, the precise output state, considering all conditions and the extension operation, would be:

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `nested_list`, and if `i` is a list, then `flat_list` contains twice the elements returned by `func_1(i)`, and if `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains `i` and the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.**
