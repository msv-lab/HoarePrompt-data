To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the structure of the `for` loop and the given conditions.

Given that `nested_list` is a list with at least two elements and `i` is the second element in `nested_list` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `nested_list` must have at least three elements. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`, and if `i` has just been the second element, the next iteration will require a third element to exist.

At the end of the previous iteration, if `i` is a list, then `flat_list` contains twice the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. If `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains two `i`s and the elements returned by `func_1(i)` if `i` was previously a list, otherwise `flat_list` contains two `i`s. However, these conditions about `flat_list` and the nature of `i` (whether it's a list or not) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute the next iteration, as the loop's progression is solely determined by the elements in `nested_list`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least three elements, and `i` will become the third element in `nested_list`. The state regarding `flat_list` and the function `func_1(i)` is dependent on the nature of this new `i` (whether it's a list or not), but the critical adjustment for the loop to proceed is the existence of a next element in `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, then `flat_list` will contain twice the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. If `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` will contain two `i`s and the elements returned by `func_1(i)` if `i` was previously a list, otherwise `flat_list` will contain two `i`s**
