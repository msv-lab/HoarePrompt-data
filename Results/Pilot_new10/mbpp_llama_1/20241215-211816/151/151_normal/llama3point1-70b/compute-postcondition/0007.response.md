According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least two elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least one element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least two elements, and `i` must be the second element in `nested_list`. 

If `i` is a list, then `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. If `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains `i` as its element. Since we do not know the type of the second element, the condition for `flat_list` should be adjusted accordingly. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, then `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. If `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains `i` as its element.**
