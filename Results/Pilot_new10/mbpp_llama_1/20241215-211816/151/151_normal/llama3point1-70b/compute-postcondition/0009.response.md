The code `flat_list.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the end of `flat_list`. 

Since `i` is the second element in `nested_list`, and `i` can be either a list or not a list, we have two cases:

1. If `i` is a list, then `flat_list` initially contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. After appending `i` to `flat_list`, it will contain the elements returned by `func_1(i)` and `i` itself.

2. If `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` initially contains `i` as its element. After appending `i` to `flat_list`, it will contain two `i`s.


The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, then `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)` and `i`. If `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains two `i`s.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `nested_list`, if `i` is a list, then `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)` and `i`, if `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains two `i`s**
