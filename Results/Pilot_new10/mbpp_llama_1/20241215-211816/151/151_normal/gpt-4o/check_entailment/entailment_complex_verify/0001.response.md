The original assessment states that the provided Python program is correct, and it will flatten any given nested list structure as expected. After reviewing the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

The annotated version of the code correctly describes the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the original assessment. The function `func_1` is designed to recursively flatten a given nested list structure, and it handles lists containing integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth.

The original assessment provides a thorough analysis of the code, including its ability to handle various scenarios, such as mixed elements, lists of lists, and consecutive sublists. The assessment also notes that the function correctly handles these cases and is designed to recursively flatten lists to any depth.

I did not find any contradictions or inaccuracies in the annotated version of the code that would suggest the original assessment is not accurate. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and its functionality, which supports the original assessment.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided information, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
