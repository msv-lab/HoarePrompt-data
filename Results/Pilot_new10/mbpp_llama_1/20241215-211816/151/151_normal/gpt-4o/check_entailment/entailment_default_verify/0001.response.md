The original assessment correctly states that the provided Python program is a recursive function designed to flatten a given nested list structure. The function `func_1` works by iterating over each item in the input list `nested_list`, and it correctly handles the base cases where the input list contains either integers or nested lists.

The output hints also verify that the function accepts a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and returns a flattened version of this list.

However, the output hints also mention that the function may throw an error if the input is not a list, but this is not a concern because the problem description assumes that the input will be a valid list. 

Additionally, the output hints mention that the function handles lists containing non-integer and non-list elements, which is not directly addressed by the original assessment. But in this case, the function will simply append these non-integer and non-list elements to the `flat_list`, which is the expected behavior for a function designed to flatten a nested list structure.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints.

Final: **True**
