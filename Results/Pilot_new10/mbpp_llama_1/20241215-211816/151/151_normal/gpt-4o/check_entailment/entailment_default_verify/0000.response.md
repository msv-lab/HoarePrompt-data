The original assessment is "None", which means there is no prior judgment on the program's correctness. We will evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided code.

The problem description asks for a function to flatten a given nested list structure. The provided code defines a recursive function `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list.

The code seems to be correct, as it recursively traverses the input list and its sublists, appending integers to the result list and extending the result list with the flattened sublists.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and returns a flattened version of this list.

However, the output hints also mention that the function "handles lists containing non-integer and non-list elements", but the provided code does not explicitly handle this case. In fact, the code only checks if an element is a list using `isinstance(item, list)`, and if not, it simply appends the element to the result list. While this might work for some non-integer and non-list elements, it does not guarantee correct behavior for all possible inputs.

Despite this, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code should work correctly for the intended use case.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, we conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
