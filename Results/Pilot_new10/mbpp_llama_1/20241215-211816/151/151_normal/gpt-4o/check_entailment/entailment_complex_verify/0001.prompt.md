You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
assert func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
assert func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]) == [10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]

def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a recursive function designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It correctly handles the base cases where the input list contains either integers or nested lists.

The function `func_1` works by iterating over each item in the input list `nested_list`. If an item is a list itself, the function calls itself with this sublist as the new input, effectively flattening it and extending the `flat_list` with the result. If the item is not a list (i.e., it's a single element like an integer), it simply appends this element to the `flat_list`.

This approach ensures that all nested lists, regardless of their depth, are properly flattened and their elements are added to the `flat_list` in the correct order.

The program's correctness can be verified by examining the provided unit tests, which cover various scenarios, including:

1.  A nested list with mixed elements (integers and lists of integers).
2.  A list of lists where each sublist may contain one or more integers.
3.  A list of lists where the sublists are ordered consecutively without any non-list elements in between.

Since the function correctly handles these cases and is designed to recursively flatten lists to any depth, it should work correctly for any potential input that matches the problem description.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided test cases, the program is correct, and it will flatten any given nested list structure as expected.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
assert func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]) == [10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and `flat_list` contains the flattened version of `nested_list`.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which contains the flattened version of nested_list, a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and returns a flattened version of this list. It handles lists containing non-integer and non-list elements, but may throw an error if the input is not a list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
