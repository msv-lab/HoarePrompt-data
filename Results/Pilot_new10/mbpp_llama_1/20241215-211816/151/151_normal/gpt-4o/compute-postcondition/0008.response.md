To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the code's impact.

1. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 2 items.
2. `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`.
3. If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` contains the flattened version of `item`. If `item` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains the value of `item`.
4. The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` extends `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(item)`. 

Since the nature of `func_1` is not specified, we will assume it processes `item` in some way that results in a list. If `item` is a list, `func_1(item)` likely returns a flattened or processed version of `item`. If `item` is not a list, `func_1(item)` could return a list containing `item` or some transformation of `item`.

Therefore, after executing `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))`, `flat_list` will contain its original elements plus the result of `func_1(item)`. The `nested_list`, `item`, and the overall structure of the data remain unchanged, as the operation is focused on `flat_list` and the result of `func_1(item)`.

Given the potential variations in what `func_1` could do, the most precise statement about the output state is:

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains its original elements plus the result of `func_1(item)`.**
