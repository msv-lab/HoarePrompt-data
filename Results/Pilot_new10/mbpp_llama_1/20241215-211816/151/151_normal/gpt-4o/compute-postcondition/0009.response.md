The code `flat_list.append(item)` adds the `item` to the end of `flat_list`. 

If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` already contains the flattened version of `item`. Now, `flat_list` will also contain the list `item` itself at the end. 

If `item` is not a list, then `flat_list` already contains the value of `item`. Now, `flat_list` will contain the value of `item` twice at the end.

The states of `nested_list` do not change.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains its previous value with `item` appended to the end**
