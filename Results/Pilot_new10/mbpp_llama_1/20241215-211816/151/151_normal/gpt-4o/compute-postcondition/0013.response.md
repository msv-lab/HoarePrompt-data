`flat_list` is appended with the value of `item`, which is the third item in the `nested_list`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The `nested_list` still contains integers and/or other lists as its elements and has at least 3 items. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the `nested_list`, and `flat_list` contains the third item of `nested_list` as its last element**
