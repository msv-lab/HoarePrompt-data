You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where the tuples are of different lengths. The `zip` function in Python stops once the shortest input iterable is exhausted. For example, if we have `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`, the function will return `(1 - 4, 2 - 5) = (-3, -3)` but it will ignore the third element of `tup1` which is `3`. The correct output should be an error or an exception because the tuples are of different lengths and we cannot perform the subtraction operation as described in the problem. 

To fix this, we need to add a check to ensure that the tuples are of the same length before performing the subtraction operation. 

Here is an example of how to modify the function to handle this case:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    if len(tup1)!= len(tup2):
        raise ValueError("Tuples must be of the same length")
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two tuples of numbers, calculates the differences between corresponding elements, and returns these differences as a tuple, assuming the tuples are of the same length and contain numeric elements, with potential edge cases including length mismatches, non-numeric elements, and empty tuples.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
