The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial assessment provided. To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided code, we can directly analyze the code and its annotations.

The problem description asks for a function that takes two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that does exactly this. It uses the `zip` function to pair elements from `tup1` and `tup2` based on their indices and then uses a generator expression to subtract each pair of elements. The result is returned as a tuple.

The annotated code provides additional insights into the state of the program. Before the function call, `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length, containing numbers. After the function call, the program returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`, which matches the problem description.

Based on this analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
