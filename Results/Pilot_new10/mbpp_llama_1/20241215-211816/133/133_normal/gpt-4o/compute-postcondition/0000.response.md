The code uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` in parallel, subtracting corresponding elements from each other. Since `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length, this operation is well-defined. The results of these subtractions are collected into a new tuple using a generator expression.

Given that `tup1` and `tup2` contain elements that support subtraction (such as numbers), the subtraction operation `a - b` will yield a result that is also a number. 

The `return` statement then returns this new tuple, which contains the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`, where `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numeric elements.**
