The original assessment is "None", which implies that no initial judgment was made about the program's correctness. After analyzing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I can see that the function `func_1` accurately subtracts corresponding elements from two input tuples.

The annotated code clarifies the function's behavior, indicating that it returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. It also mentions that the function stops once the end of the shorter tuple is reached if they are not of the same length, which is the expected behavior of the `zip` function in Python. However, this point is not directly relevant to the problem description, which assumes the tuples are of the same length.

Given that the tuples are expected to be of the same length and contain numeric elements, the function correctly implements the required behavior. The unit tests provided also validate this behavior.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotated code, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
