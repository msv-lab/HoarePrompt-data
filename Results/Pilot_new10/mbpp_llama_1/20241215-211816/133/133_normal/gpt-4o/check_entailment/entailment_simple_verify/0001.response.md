Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment of "None" implies that there was no initial assessment made. 

Upon reviewing the code and the annotated version, it is clear that the function `func_1` is designed to take two tuples of the same length, containing numeric elements, and return a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of the two input tuples.

The annotated version of the code confirms this understanding, as it states that the program returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`, where `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numeric elements.

The provided unit tests also support this understanding, as they demonstrate the function's behavior with different input tuples.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, it appears that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
