Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`.

The function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the elements of `tup1` and `tup2` in parallel, and a generator expression to calculate the differences between corresponding elements. The `tuple` function is then used to convert the generator expression into a tuple, which is returned by the function.

The program meets the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Tuple subtraction**: The program correctly subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple.
2. **Same index**: The program uses the `zip` function to ensure that elements at the same index are subtracted from each other.
3. **Tuple return**: The program returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of the input tuples.

The program also handles cases where the input tuples are of the same length, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.

However, it's worth noting that the program does not explicitly check if the input tuples are of the same length or if they contain non-numeric elements. If the tuples are not of the same length, the `zip` function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, and if the tuples contain non-numeric elements, a `TypeError` will be raised when attempting to subtract them. This behavior is consistent with the problem description, which assumes that the input tuples are of the same length and contain numeric elements.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and meets the requirements of the problem description.
