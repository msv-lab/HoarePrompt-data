To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that takes two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.

2. **Provided Code**:
   ```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
   ```
   This code uses `zip` to iterate over both tuples in parallel, subtracts corresponding elements, and returns the result as a tuple.

3. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment concludes that the program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly handles the subtraction of elements from two tuples.

4. **Output Hints**: The output hints indicate that the function stops once the end of the shorter tuple is reached if they are not of the same length and raises a TypeError if the tuples contain non-numeric elements.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the function does correctly subtract corresponding elements from two tuples. However, the problem description does not explicitly mention what should happen if the tuples are of different lengths or if they contain non-numeric elements. The output hints provide additional information on how the function behaves in these cases.

The original assessment does not consider the case when the input tuples are of different lengths or contain non-numeric elements. However, based on the output hints, it seems the function behaves as expected in these scenarios (it stops at the end of the shorter tuple and raises an error for non-numeric elements, respectively).

But, there is an issue here. The problem description asks to subtract elements of the first tuple by elements of the second tuple with the same index, which implies an assumption that both tuples should be of the same length. The function as described behaves correctly under this assumption, and the output hints clarify its behavior outside this assumption.

Given that we assume the input will be valid (tuples of the same length and containing numeric elements), the function works as expected according to the problem description. The output hints provide additional behavior but do not contradict the problem description given the assumptions about the input.

Therefore, the final assessment is that the program is correct based on the assumptions provided and the problem description.

Final: **True**
