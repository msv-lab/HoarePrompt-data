You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)

def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the two tuples in parallel, and a generator expression to perform the subtraction. The result is then converted back to a tuple using the `tuple` function.

This approach works correctly for tuples of the same length, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests. Additionally, the function will raise a `ValueError` if the tuples are of different lengths, which is also a correct behavior according to the problem description (since the problem implies that the tuples should have the same length).

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any explicit error handling for cases where the tuples are not of the same length. But in Python, the `zip` function will stop once the shortest input iterable is exhausted, which means that if the tuples are of different lengths, the function will still work, but it will ignore the extra elements in the longer tuple.

In any case, the provided function works as expected for all the unit tests and for any other potential case where the tuples have the same length, so the correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length, containing elements that support subtraction (e.g., numbers).
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`, where `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numeric elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, tup1 and tup2, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of tup1 and tup2. It stops once the end of the shorter tuple is reached if they are not of the same length, and raises a TypeError if the tuples contain non-numeric elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
