You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(tup, lst)` counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and sums up the counts of each element in the tuple.

Here's why this code is correct:

- It correctly handles cases where the list contains elements that are present in the tuple, as it counts their occurrences accurately.

- If the list contains elements that are not present in the tuple, `tup.count(element)` will return 0 for those elements, which is the correct count.

- The function also handles duplicate elements in the list correctly, as it counts the occurrences of each element in the tuple for every occurrence of that element in the list.

- It handles edge cases, such as an empty list or an empty tuple, correctly, returning 0 in both cases.

For example, if `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3)` and `lst = [2, 3, 4]`, the function will correctly return 3, which is the sum of the counts of 2 (2) and 3 (1) in the tuple, and 0 for 4 since it is not in the tuple.

Overall, the code provided accurately counts the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple and handles all potential cases as expected.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and lst is a list.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the sum of counts of elements from list `lst` as they appear in tuple `tup`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, counts the occurrences of each element from `lst` in `tup`, and returns the sum of these counts, handling empty inputs by returning `0`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
