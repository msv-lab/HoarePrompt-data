You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2

def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to count the occurrences of each element from the list in the tuple. The `count` method of the tuple is used to count the occurrences of each element.

Here's why the code is correct in every case:

- The function takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as input, which matches the problem description.
- It uses `tup.count(element)` to count the occurrences of each `element` in the tuple, which is the correct method to count occurrences in a tuple.
- The `sum` function adds up the counts of all elements from the list in the tuple, providing the total count as required by the problem description.
- The function handles tuples and lists of any length and does not have any built-in limitations that would cause incorrect results for certain inputs.
- The provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness for various scenarios.

Since the code correctly implements the described functionality and no edge cases have been found where it does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple and a list, and returns the total count of occurrences in the tuple for all elements present in the list, handling empty inputs, duplicate elements in the list, and potentially other types of inputs, but may raise errors for non-hashable elements in the list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
