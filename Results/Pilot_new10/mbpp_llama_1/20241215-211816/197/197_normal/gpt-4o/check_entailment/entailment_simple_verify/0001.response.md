The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as input, counts the occurrences of each element from the list in the tuple using the `count` method, and returns the total count using the `sum` function. 

The annotated version of the code also confirms this understanding. It states that the program returns the total count of occurrences in `tup` for all elements present in `elements`, which matches the described functionality.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and the function returns the expected results.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the program appears to be correct.

Final: **True**
