You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2

def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` is designed to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. This is achieved by using a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list and count its occurrences in the tuple.

The `tup.count(element)` method is used to count the occurrences of each element in the tuple. This method is case-sensitive and will treat 'a' and 'A' as different elements. 

The function works as expected for all potential cases because:

1. It correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the list within the tuple.
2. It handles duplicate elements in the list correctly by counting their occurrences separately.
3. It handles cases where an element in the list is not present in the tuple by counting its occurrences as 0.

No edge cases have been found where the function does not work as expected. Therefore, the function is correct for all potential cases. 

Example:
```python
print(func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']))  # Output: 3
print(func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]))  # Output: 6
print(func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]))  # Output: 2
```
These examples demonstrate the function's correctness in handling different scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple and a list, and returns the total count of occurrences in the tuple for all elements present in the list, handling empty inputs, duplicate elements in the list, and potentially other types of inputs, but may raise errors for non-hashable elements in the list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
