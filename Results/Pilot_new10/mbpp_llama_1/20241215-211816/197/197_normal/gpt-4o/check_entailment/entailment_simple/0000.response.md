Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The problem description requires a function to count the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple. 

The provided function, `func_1`, takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `elements` (a list). It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element in `elements` and count its occurrences in `tup` using the `count` method. The results are summed together to get the total count of occurrences of all elements in `elements` within `tup`.

This approach ensures that for every potential case, the function will return the correct total count of occurrences of all elements in the list within the tuple. The use of `tup.count(element)` for each element in `elements` covers all possible scenarios where an element from the list may appear zero, one, or multiple times in the tuple.

The unit tests provided (`assert` statements) further demonstrate the correctness of the function by covering different scenarios, including counting occurrences of different types of elements (both strings and integers) and handling cases where elements from the list appear multiple times or not at all in the tuple.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the implementation, the function `func_1` is correct and meets the requirements for all potential cases.
