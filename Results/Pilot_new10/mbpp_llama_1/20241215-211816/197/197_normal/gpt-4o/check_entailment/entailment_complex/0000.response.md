Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as input and returns the total count of occurrences in `tup` for all elements present in `elements`. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Handling all elements**: The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the `elements` list and count its occurrences in the `tup` tuple. This ensures that the count of all elements present in `elements` is accounted for.

2. **Counting occurrences**: The `count` method of the tuple `tup` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `elements`. This method returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple, which is then summed up for all elements.

3. **Handling empty inputs**: If the `elements` list is empty, the `sum` function will return 0, because the generator expression will be empty. This is the expected behavior, as there are no elements to count.

4. **Handling duplicate elements in the list**: If there are duplicate elements in the `elements` list, the `count` method will be called multiple times for the same element. However, the `sum` function will still return the correct total count, because the counts for each duplicate element will be added together.

5. **Handling non-hashable elements in the list**: Although the function may raise errors for non-hashable elements in the list (because the `count` method requires hashable elements), this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description as a requirement to handle. The function behaves correctly for all hashable elements, which is the typical use case for tuples and lists in Python.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and handles various edge cases correctly.
