Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is not applicable as it is stated as "None". However, we can evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the output hints.

The problem description asks for a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses a set to check for duplicate elements in the input array. The function returns `True` if the length of the input array is not equal to the length of the set created from the array, indicating that there are duplicate elements.

The output hints suggest that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` if the list contains duplicate elements and `False` otherwise. However, it also mentions that the function may raise a `TypeError` if the list contains unhashable types, which could be a potential issue if the input array contains non-integer or non-hashable elements.

Since the problem description does not explicitly state that the input array will only contain integers or hashable types, we can assume that the function may not work correctly for all possible input cases. However, considering the provided output hints and the assumption that the input will be valid, the function seems to be correct for the specified use case.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, I believe that the program is correct for the specified use case, assuming that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors.

Final: **True**
