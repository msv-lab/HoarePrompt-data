The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` as its parameter. The function uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicate integers from the list. It then compares the length of the original list `arr` with the length of the set using `len(arr)!= len(set(arr))`. This comparison will return `True` if there are any duplicate integers in the list (because the set will be smaller than the original list), and `False` otherwise.

Looking at the code line by line, it does exactly what the annotations say: it checks for duplicate integers in the list by comparing the lengths of the original list and the set created from the list. There are no explicit edge cases handled in the code (like empty lists or non-integer elements), but the code will still work correctly for these cases because:

- An empty list will be converted to an empty set, and their lengths will be equal, so the function will correctly return `False` indicating no duplicates.
- If the list contains non-integer elements, the code will still work because Python's `set` can contain any hashable types, including strings, tuples, etc. However, if the list contains unhashable types (like lists or dictionaries), attempting to convert it to a set will raise a `TypeError`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function covers the general case of detecting duplicate integers in a list but may exhibit unexpected behavior (like raising an exception) if the list contains unhashable types.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of elements, returns True if the list contains duplicate elements (assuming all elements are hashable), and False otherwise. It handles empty lists correctly but may raise a TypeError if the list contains unhashable types. **
