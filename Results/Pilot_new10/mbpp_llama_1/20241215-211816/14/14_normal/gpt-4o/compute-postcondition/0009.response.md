The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. The initial state is: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr`, `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`. 

If `num` is in `seen`, the program returns True, but this is not executed in the given code. However, `num` is now added to the set `seen`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr` and the second integer in `arr`, `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`.**
