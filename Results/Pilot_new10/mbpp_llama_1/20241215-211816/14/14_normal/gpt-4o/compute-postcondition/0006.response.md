According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `seen` contains the first integer in `arr`, and `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the list `arr` must have at least 2 integers, `seen` must contain the first integer in `arr`, and `num` must be the second integer in the list `arr`.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr`, `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`**
