You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]) == True
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == True

def func_1(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. It iterates over the input array and uses a set to keep track of the elements it has seen so far. If it encounters an element that is already in the set, it immediately returns True, indicating that there are duplicate elements in the array. If it iterates over the entire array without finding any duplicates, it returns False.

The use of a set for this purpose is efficient, as it allows for constant-time membership checks. The program handles edge cases such as an empty array or an array with a single element correctly, as it will simply return False in these cases. The program also correctly identifies arrays with duplicate elements, regardless of their position or frequency.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected for all possible input cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, checks for duplicates, and returns True if any duplicates are found, or False if the list contains all unique integers or is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
