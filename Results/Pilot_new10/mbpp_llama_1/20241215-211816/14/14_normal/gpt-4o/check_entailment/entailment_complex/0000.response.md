Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description, which is to determine whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing an empty set `seen`. This set will be used to keep track of the unique integers encountered so far in the array.

2. **Iteration**: It then iterates over each integer `num` in the input array `arr`.

3. **Duplicate Check**: For each integer, it checks if `num` is already present in the `seen` set. If `num` is found in the `seen` set, it means that `num` is a duplicate in the array, so the function immediately returns `True`, indicating the presence of a duplicate.

4. **Adding to Set**: If `num` is not in the `seen` set, it is added to the set. This ensures that `seen` always contains the unique integers encountered up to the current point in the iteration.

5. **No Duplicates Found**: If the function iterates over the entire array without finding any duplicates (i.e., without returning `True`), it means that all elements in the array are unique. In this case, after the loop completes, the function returns `False`, correctly indicating that no duplicates were found.

6. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function also correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with a single element. In these cases, the function will iterate over the array (which might be empty or contain a single element), find no duplicates, and return `False` as expected.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further validate the function's behavior for various scenarios, including arrays with and without duplicates, and these tests pass as expected.

Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description's requirements for all potential cases.
