To determine the final correctness of the program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.

2. **Provided Code**: The code defines a function `func_1` that iterates through each number in the input array `arr`. It uses a set `seen` to keep track of the numbers it has encountered so far. If it finds a number that is already in the `seen` set, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that there is at least one duplicate element in the array. If it iterates through the entire array without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

3. **Original Assessment**: There is no original assessment provided, which means we start with a blank slate regarding the correctness of the function.

4. **Annotated Version of the Code**: The annotated version provides a step-by-step breakdown of what the function does. It explains the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function works as intended: it correctly identifies when there are duplicate elements in the array and when there are not.

Based on the provided code and the annotated version, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently checks for duplicate elements in an array by utilizing a set to keep track of unique elements encountered so far. This approach allows it to return as soon as it finds a duplicate, making it efficient for large arrays with duplicates early on, and it correctly returns `False` for arrays with all unique elements.

Given the analysis, the original lack of assessment means we cannot compare the annotated version's accuracy to a pre-existing evaluation. However, the annotated version and the code itself provide a clear, logical, and correct implementation of the problem's solution.

**Final: True**
