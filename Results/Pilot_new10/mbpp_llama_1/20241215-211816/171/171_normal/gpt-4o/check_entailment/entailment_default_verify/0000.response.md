The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the parity of a given number is odd by using the expression `n % 2!= 0`, which returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. This logic applies to all integers, and the provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works as expected.

The output hints also support the original assessment, as they state that the function returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, for any integer input. This aligns with the problem description and the provided code.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
