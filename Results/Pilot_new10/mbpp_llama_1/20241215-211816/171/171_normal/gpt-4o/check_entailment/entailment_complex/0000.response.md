Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. 

Here's why it works:

- The problem description asks to find if the parity of a given number is odd.
- The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even.
- The expression `n % 2!= 0` checks if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. If this condition is met, it means `n` is an odd number, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
- The provided assertions demonstrate the correctness of the function for both even and odd numbers.

Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description and returns the expected results for all integer inputs.
