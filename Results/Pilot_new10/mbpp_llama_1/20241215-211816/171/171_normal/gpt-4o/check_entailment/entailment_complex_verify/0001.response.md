The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by using the modulus operator `%`. The expression `n % 2!= 0` evaluates to `True` if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not zero, indicating an odd number, and `False` otherwise, indicating an even number.

The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment, as it clearly states that the function returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, which aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the unit tests provided in the original code, such as `assert func_1(12) == False`, `assert func_1(7) == True`, and `assert func_1(10) == False`, demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios.

Since the function correctly implements the problem description and the annotated version of the code supports this assessment, I believe the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
