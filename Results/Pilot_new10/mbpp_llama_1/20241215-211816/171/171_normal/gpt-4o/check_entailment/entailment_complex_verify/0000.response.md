The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

However, based on the problem description, the program, and the annotated version, we can evaluate the program's correctness. 

The problem description asks for a function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided program defines a function `func_1` that returns `True` if the input number `n` is odd and `False` if it is even. This is achieved through the expression `n % 2!= 0`, which is a common and correct method for checking the parity of a number.

The annotated version of the code confirms this understanding, stating that the function returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even.

Given this information, it appears that the program is correct based on the problem description. The program accurately determines the parity of the input number and returns the expected result.

Final: **True**
