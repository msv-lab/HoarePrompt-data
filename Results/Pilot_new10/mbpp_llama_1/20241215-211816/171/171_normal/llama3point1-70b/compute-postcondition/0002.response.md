The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `n`. The code checks if `n` is odd by using the modulus operator (`n % 2!= 0`). This operation returns `True` if the remainder of the division of `n` by 2 is not equal to 0, indicating that `n` is an odd integer. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is an even integer.

Upon examining the code and annotations, it appears that the code accurately implements the described functionality without any missing logic or edge cases. The function works with both positive and negative integers, as well as zero, correctly identifying them as even or odd based on their remainder when divided by 2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to determine whether a given integer `n` is odd or even and return a boolean value accordingly.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, `False` if `n` is an even integer, working correctly for all integer values including positive, negative, and zero. **
