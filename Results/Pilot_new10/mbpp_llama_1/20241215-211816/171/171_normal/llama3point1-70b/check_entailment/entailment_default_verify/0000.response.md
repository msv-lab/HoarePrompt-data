The original assessment is "None", which means there is no prior evaluation of the program's correctness. The problem description asks to write a Python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer.

The output hints confirm that the function works correctly for all integer values, including positive, negative, and zero. This aligns with the problem description, which does not impose any restrictions on the input range.

Given the code and output hints, it appears that the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The code uses the modulo operator (`%`) to determine the remainder of the division of `n` by 2, which is a standard approach to check for odd or even numbers.

Since the output hints match the expected behavior based on the problem description, and the code logically implements the required functionality, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
