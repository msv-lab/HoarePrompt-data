You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to determine whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), it indicates that the number is odd.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases for integer inputs, both positive and negative, as well as zero. For example:

- For any even number (e.g., 2, 4, 6), `n % 2` will be 0, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `False`, indicating the number is not odd.
- For any odd number (e.g., 1, 3, 5), `n % 2` will not be 0, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `True`, indicating the number is odd.
- For negative numbers, the modulus operation in Python returns a result with the same sign as the divisor (2 in this case), which is positive. Therefore, `-1 % 2` equals 1, indicating that -1 is odd, and `-2 % 2` equals 0, indicating that -2 is even.
- For zero, `0 % 2` equals 0, correctly identifying zero as not odd.

Given that the function correctly handles all integer inputs and edge cases (including zero and negative numbers) according to the problem description, it is concluded that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, `False` if `n` is an even integer, working correctly for all integer values including positive, negative, and zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
