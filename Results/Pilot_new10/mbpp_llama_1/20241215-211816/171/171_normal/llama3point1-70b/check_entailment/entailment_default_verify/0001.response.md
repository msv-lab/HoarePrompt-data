The original assessment is "None", which implies that no evaluation of the program's correctness has been made.

The problem description requires a function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves correctly for all integer values, including positive, negative, and zero.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. The function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the division of `n` by 2, which is a standard and correct approach to determine the parity of a number.

Therefore, the original assessment of "None" is not accurate, as the provided code and output hints demonstrate that the function is correct.

Final: **True**
