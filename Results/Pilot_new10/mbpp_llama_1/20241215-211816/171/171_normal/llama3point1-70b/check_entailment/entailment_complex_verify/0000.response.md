Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description asks to write a Python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. The function uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder when `n` is divided by 2, which correctly determines the parity of the number.

The annotated version of the code confirms this, stating that the function returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer, working correctly for all integer values including positive, negative, and zero.

The original assessment correctly identifies the function's behavior for different types of input, including positive and negative integers, and zero. The assessment concludes that the program is correct because it handles all possible inputs correctly according to the problem description.

Therefore, I see no reason to dispute the original assessment. The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd, and the original assessment accurately reflects this.

Final: **True**.
