The original assessment is "None", indicating that there was no initial assessment provided. Based on the problem description, the program is supposed to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. 

The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, which aligns with the problem description. The annotated code further confirms this behavior, stating that the function works correctly for all integer values, including positive, negative, and zero.

Since the program behaves as expected according to the problem description and the annotated code, the program appears to be correct.

Final: **True**
