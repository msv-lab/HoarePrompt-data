Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to determine whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. It uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder when `n` is divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, it means the number is odd, and the function returns `True`.

The function works correctly for all potential cases:

- For any positive odd integer, `n % 2` will be 1, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `True`.
- For any positive even integer, `n % 2` will be 0, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `False`.
- For negative odd integers, the modulus operation in Python returns a result with the same sign as the divisor (in this case, 2), so `n % 2` will be -1, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `True`.
- For negative even integers, `n % 2` will be 0, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `False`.
- For zero, which is an even number, `n % 2` will be 0, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `False`.

The function handles all possible inputs correctly according to the problem description, which asks to identify whether the parity of a given number is odd. Therefore, the program is correct, and there are no potential cases where it does not work as expected.
