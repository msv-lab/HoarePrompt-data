Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description, which is to remove all whitespaces from a string. The issue with the code is that it only removes space characters (' ') and does not account for other types of whitespace characters, such as tabs ('\t'), newline characters ('\n'), and others.

For example, if the input string is "Hello\tWorld\n", the function will return "Hello\tWorld\n", not "HelloWorld", because it does not remove the tab and newline characters. 

A correct implementation would use the `replace()` method with all whitespace characters or utilize regular expressions to remove all whitespace characters. A more accurate approach could be to use the `str.translate()` method or a regular expression substitution, but a simpler way to achieve the desired result would be to use the `str.replace()` method in combination with the `str.split()` and `str.join()` methods, or simply by using the `re.sub()` function from the `re` module. 

However, the most straightforward way to remove all whitespace characters (including spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) would be to use a list comprehension with `str.join()` and `str.split()` without arguments, or more directly by using the `str.translate()` method, like so:

```python
def func_1(input_str):
    return input_str.replace(' ', '').replace('\t', '').replace('\n', '')
```
Or, using regular expressions:

```python
import re

def func_1(input_str):
    return re.sub(r'\s+', '', input_str)
```

Or, in Python, you could simply use the `str.split()` and `str.join()` methods without arguments, which splits on all whitespace and then joins without any separator:

```python
def func_1(input_str):
    return ''.join(input_str.split())
```
