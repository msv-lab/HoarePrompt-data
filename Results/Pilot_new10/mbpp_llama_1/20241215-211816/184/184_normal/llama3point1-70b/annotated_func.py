#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of odd integers from the 'nums' list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, returns a list of odd integers from the input list, and handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists with only even numbers by returning an empty list, but may raise errors or behave unexpectedly with non-integer values or None input.
