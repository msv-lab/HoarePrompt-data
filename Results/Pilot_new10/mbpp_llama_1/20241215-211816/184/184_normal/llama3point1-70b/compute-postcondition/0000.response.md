To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code. The code uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the numbers from the `nums` list where `num % 2!= 0`. This condition filters out even numbers, as any number divided by 2 that leaves a remainder (i.e., `num % 2!= 0`) is odd.

Given the initial state that `nums` is a list of integers, the code will return a new list containing only the odd integers from `nums`.

Output State: **The program returns a list of odd integers from the 'nums' list**
