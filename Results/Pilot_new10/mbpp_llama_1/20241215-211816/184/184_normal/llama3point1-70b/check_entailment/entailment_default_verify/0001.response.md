The original assessment states that the program is correct, and after reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it appears that the original assessment is mostly accurate. The code does indeed filter odd numbers from a given list of numbers as described in the problem.

However, the output hints mention that the function may raise errors or behave unexpectedly with non-integer values or None input. This is an important consideration because the problem description does not explicitly state what should happen in these cases. But since we assume the input will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

The original assessment correctly identifies how the function handles various potential cases such as an empty list, a list with only even numbers, a list with only odd numbers, and a list with mixed numbers. The provided code correctly implements the described functionality for these cases.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the assumption of valid input, the original assessment's conclusion about the program's correctness is accurate.

Final: **True**
