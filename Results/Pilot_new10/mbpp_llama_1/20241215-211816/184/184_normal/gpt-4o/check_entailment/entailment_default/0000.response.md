Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of odd numbers from that input. The function uses a list comprehension with a condition `num % 2!= 0` to filter out the even numbers and only include the odd numbers in the output list.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

1. **Empty list:** If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list, which is the expected behavior.

2. **List with only even numbers:** If the input list contains only even numbers, the function will return an empty list, which is correct because there are no odd numbers to filter.

3. **List with only odd numbers:** If the input list contains only odd numbers, the function will return the original list, which is correct because all the numbers are odd.

4. **List with both even and odd numbers:** If the input list contains both even and odd numbers, the function will return a list of only the odd numbers, which is the expected behavior.

5. **List with non-integer values:** Although the output hints mention that the function may raise a TypeError if the input list contains non-integer values, this is not a requirement specified in the problem description. The problem description only asks to filter odd numbers, and it does not specify what to do with non-integer values. However, in Python, the modulo operator `%` can be used with floating-point numbers, and the condition `num % 2!= 0` will evaluate to True for non-integer numbers that are not even multiples of 2. Therefore, the function will still work correctly even if the input list contains non-integer values.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the function is correct for all potential cases.
