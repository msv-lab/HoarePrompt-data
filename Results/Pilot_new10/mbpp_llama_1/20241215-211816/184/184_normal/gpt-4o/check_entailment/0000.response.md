Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly filter odd numbers from a given list of integers. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is odd by using the condition `num % 2!= 0`. If the number is odd, it is included in the output list; otherwise, it is skipped.

The function has been tested with various input cases, as shown by the provided assertions, and it produces the expected results. The function also handles cases where the input list contains only odd numbers, only even numbers, or a mix of both.

I was unable to find any potential case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly filters out even numbers and returns a list of odd numbers from the input list. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct in every potential case.
