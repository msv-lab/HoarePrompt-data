Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to filter out odd numbers from a list of integers. It utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums` and checks if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is not equal to 0 (`num % 2!= 0`). If this condition is met, the number is included in the resulting list.

The function correctly handles various test cases, including lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers. The provided assertions demonstrate the function's correctness for these scenarios.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears to be robust and handles all potential cases correctly. The use of the modulo operator (`%`) ensures accurate identification of odd numbers, and the list comprehension provides an efficient means of filtering the input list. Since no edge cases or potential flaws were found, the function is deemed correct.
