The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums`. The code uses a list comprehension to filter out even numbers from the list and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the input list.

Looking at the code, it appears to handle all potential cases, including empty lists and lists with no odd integers. The code does not check the type of the input list or its elements, so it may raise an error if the input is not a list or if the list contains non-integer values.

The code does not have any explicit error handling for edge cases, but the list comprehension will simply return an empty list if the input list is empty. If the input list contains non-integer values, the code will raise a TypeError when it tries to use the modulus operator (`%`) on a non-integer value.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers, returns a list of odd integers from the input list, and handles empty lists by returning an empty list; however, it may raise a TypeError if the input list contains non-integer values. **
