Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the function to find the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width, which is exactly what the function `func_1` does. It takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. 

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Since the problem description requires a function to find the area of a rectangle and the given function does exactly that, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Additionally, the function works for all potential cases where `length` and `width` are non-negative numbers, as stated in the problem description. There are no cases where the function would not return the correct area of a rectangle, given valid input. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the program is correct.
