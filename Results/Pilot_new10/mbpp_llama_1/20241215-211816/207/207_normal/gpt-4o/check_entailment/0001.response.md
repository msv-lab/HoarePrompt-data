Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the area of a rectangle. This function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the correctness of the function for different input values. The function correctly calculates the area for rectangles with various dimensions, such as 10x20, 10x5, and 4x2.

To further verify the correctness, let's analyze potential edge cases:

1. **Zero dimensions**: If either the length or width is zero, the function correctly returns an area of zero, which is the expected result.
2. **Negative dimensions**: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention negative dimensions, in the context of rectangles, negative lengths or widths are not meaningful. However, from a purely mathematical perspective, the function will return a negative area for negative inputs, which might not be the expected result in the context of geometry. Nevertheless, the problem description does not specify what to do in such cases, so it's not possible to claim the function is incorrect based solely on this.
3. **Non-numeric dimensions**: The function does not handle non-numeric inputs. If either the length or width is a non-numeric value (e.g., a string or a list), the function will raise a TypeError. While this might be considered an omission, it does not make the function incorrect for the cases it is designed to handle.

Given the information provided and the analysis of potential edge cases, the function appears to be correct for calculating the area of a rectangle as per the problem description, assuming the inputs are valid numeric values.
