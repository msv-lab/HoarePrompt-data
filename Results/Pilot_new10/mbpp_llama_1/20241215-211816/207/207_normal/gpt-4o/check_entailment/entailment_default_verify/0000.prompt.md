You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the area of a rectangle.
Program:
```
assert func_1(10, 20) == 200
assert func_1(10, 5) == 50
assert func_1(4, 2) == 8

def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program provided is a simple function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The formula used is the standard formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length multiplied by width. 

The program handles all potential cases correctly because it correctly implements the formula for the area of a rectangle. There are no conditional statements or complex logic that could lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. The multiplication operation is correctly applied to all possible inputs of length and width.

The unit tests provided, `assert func_1(10, 20) == 200`, `assert func_1(10, 5) == 50`, and `assert func_1(4, 2) == 8`, demonstrate that the function works as expected for different inputs. There are no edge cases (like zero or negative numbers) that are not handled correctly, as the function will still produce the correct result (zero for a rectangle with zero length or width, and a negative number for a "rectangle" with a negative dimension, although in reality, a rectangle cannot have a negative dimension).

However, it's worth noting that in the real world, the dimensions of a rectangle cannot be negative, and the function does not check for this. But according to the mathematical formula, the function works correctly even for negative inputs, producing the correct result for the mathematical operation. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two numeric parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, regardless of whether they are positive, negative, or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
