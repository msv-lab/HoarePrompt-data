Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input parameters `length` or `width` are negative numbers. The area of a rectangle is defined as the product of its length and width, but both length and width must be positive numbers. If either `length` or `width` is negative, the function will return a negative number, which is not a valid area.

For example, if we call `func_1(-10, 20)`, the function will return `-200`, which is not the correct area.

To fix this issue, the function should add a check to ensure that both `length` and `width` are positive numbers before returning their product. If either `length` or `width` is negative or zero, the function should raise an error or return an error message, because the area of a rectangle with negative or zero length or width is not defined.

Here is an example of how the corrected function could look:

```python
def func_1(length, width):
    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Length and width must be positive numbers")
    return length * width
```

This version of the function checks if either `length` or `width` is not a positive number and raises a `ValueError` if so. Otherwise, it returns the product of `length` and `width`.
