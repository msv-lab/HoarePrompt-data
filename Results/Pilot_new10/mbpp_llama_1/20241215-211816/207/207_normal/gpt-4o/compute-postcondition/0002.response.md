The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. The code does not explicitly check if the inputs are non-negative, so it will return the product of any two numbers, regardless of their sign. The annotations suggest that the inputs should be non-negative, but the code does not enforce this constraint.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two numeric parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, regardless of whether they are positive, negative, or zero. **
