Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the function to find the area of a rectangle as described in the problem description. Although it correctly calculates the area for valid non-negative inputs, it does not handle cases where the inputs are negative or non-numeric. The output hints agree with this assessment, stating that the function returns the product of the inputs regardless of whether they are non-negative or not and throws an error if either input is not a number. However, this behavior does not align with the problem description, which implicitly expects the function to handle invalid inputs by either ignoring them, raising an informative error, or returning a specific value to indicate an invalid input.

A specific case where the program does not work correctly is when the inputs are negative. For example, `func_1(-3, 4)` would return `-12`, which is mathematically correct but might not align with the geometric interpretation of the area of a rectangle, where dimensions are typically considered non-negative. Another case is when the inputs are non-numeric, such as `func_1("five", 4)`, which would indeed throw an error, but the code does not explicitly handle this case in a way that provides informative feedback or gracefully handles the error as per the problem's implicit expectations.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to a conclusion of Correctness: **False**.
