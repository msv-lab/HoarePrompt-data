You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the area of a rectangle.
Program:
```
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width, which is the correct mathematical formula for the area of a rectangle. 

The function does not contain any conditional statements or loops that could potentially lead to incorrect results. It simply returns the product of the input length and width, which will always be the correct area of the rectangle.

This function will correctly handle all potential cases, including rectangles with integer and floating-point dimensions, as well as rectangles with zero or negative dimensions (although the latter may not be physically meaningful, the function will still return the correct mathematical result).

For example, `func_1(5, 3)` will return `15`, which is the correct area of a rectangle with length 5 and width 3. Similarly, `func_1(4.5, 2.8)` will return `12.6`, which is also correct. 

Therefore, the function meets the problem description and is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, regardless of whether they are non-negative or not, and throws an error if either input is not a number

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
