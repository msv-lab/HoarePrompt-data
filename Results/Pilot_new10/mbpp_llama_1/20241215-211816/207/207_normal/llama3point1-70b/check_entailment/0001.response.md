Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. This aligns with the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width.

The function does not handle potential edge cases such as negative input values or non-numeric input, but based on the problem description alone, it correctly implements the formula for the area of a rectangle for all positive numeric inputs. 

To make the function more robust, additional error checking could be added to handle edge cases, but as it stands, for the specific task of calculating the area given positive numeric lengths and widths, the function works as expected. 

Therefore, without any additional constraints or requirements from the problem description, the function is considered to work correctly for the specified task.
