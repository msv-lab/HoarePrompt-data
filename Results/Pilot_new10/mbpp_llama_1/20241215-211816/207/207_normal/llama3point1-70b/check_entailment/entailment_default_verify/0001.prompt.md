You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the area of a rectangle.
Program:
```
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. This aligns with the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width.

The function does not handle potential edge cases such as negative input values or non-numeric input, but based on the problem description alone, it correctly implements the formula for the area of a rectangle for all positive numeric inputs. 

To make the function more robust, additional error checking could be added to handle edge cases, but as it stands, for the specific task of calculating the area given positive numeric lengths and widths, the function works as expected. 

Therefore, without any additional constraints or requirements from the problem description, the function is considered to work correctly for the specified task.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, regardless of whether they are non-negative or not, and throws an error if either input is not a number

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
