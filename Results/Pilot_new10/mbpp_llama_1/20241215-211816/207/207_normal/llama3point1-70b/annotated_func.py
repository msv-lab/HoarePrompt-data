#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative numbers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the product of two non-negative numbers, `length` and `width`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, regardless of whether they are non-negative or not, and throws an error if either input is not a number
