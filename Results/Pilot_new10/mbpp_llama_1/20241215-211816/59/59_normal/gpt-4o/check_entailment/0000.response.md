Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. Here's why:

1. The function combines the three input lists into a single list `combined_list`.
2. It then sorts `combined_list` in ascending order using the built-in `sorted` function.
3. The sorted list is returned as the result.

This approach satisfies the problem description for every potential case. The `sorted` function in Python is a stable sort, which means it preserves the order of equal elements. This ensures that if there are duplicate elements in the input lists, they will be preserved in the output list.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function. The function handles lists with duplicate elements, lists with varying lengths, and lists containing a mix of small and large numbers.

In general, this function works correctly for any combination of input lists, regardless of their size, contents, or order. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
