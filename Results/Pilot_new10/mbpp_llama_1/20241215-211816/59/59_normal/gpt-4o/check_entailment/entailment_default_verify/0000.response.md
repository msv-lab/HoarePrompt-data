The original assessment is "None", indicating that no initial assessment was made. 

However, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I can evaluate the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that combines three lists into one, sorts the combined list, and returns the sorted list. The output hints confirm that the function accepts three lists, combines them, and returns a new sorted list in ascending order.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears to correctly implement the required functionality. The `func_1` function takes three lists as input, combines them using the `+` operator, sorts the combined list using the `sorted` function, and returns the sorted list. 

The output hints indicate that the function ignores empty input lists and assumes the elements can be compared with each other. The provided unit tests also suggest that the function works correctly for lists containing integers.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the program is correct.

Final: **True**
