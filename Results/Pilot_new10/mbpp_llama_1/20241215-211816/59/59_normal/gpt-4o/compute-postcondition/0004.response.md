To understand the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's analyze it step by step.

1. The function accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. These parameters are expected to be lists of elements that can be compared for sorting.

2. Inside the function, these lists are combined into one list called `combined_list` using the `+` operator.

3. The `combined_list` is then sorted in ascending order using the `sorted()` function, and the result is stored in `sorted_list`.

4. Finally, the function returns `sorted_list`, which contains all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in a sorted order.

The annotations suggest that the function works as intended for lists of elements that can be compared for sorting. However, it's essential to note potential edge cases and missing logic:

- The function does not handle the case where the input lists contain elements that cannot be compared with each other (e.g., mixing strings with integers). In such cases, the `sorted()` function would raise a `TypeError`.

- The function assumes that all input parameters are lists. If any of the parameters are not lists, the `+` operator could raise a `TypeError`.

- The function does not check for empty lists. If one or more of the input lists are empty, they will simply be ignored in the sorting process, as the `+` operator and the `sorted()` function can handle empty lists without issues.

Considering these points, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts three lists of elements, combines them into one list, and returns a new sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order, assuming the elements can be compared with each other; it does not handle cases where elements are not comparable or where inputs are not lists, and it ignores empty input lists. **
