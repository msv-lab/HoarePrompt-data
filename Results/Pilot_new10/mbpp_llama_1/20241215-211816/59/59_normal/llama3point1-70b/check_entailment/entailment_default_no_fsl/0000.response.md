Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list in ascending order using the `sorted` function. The function returns the sorted list.

The problem description requires a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list, which is exactly what the provided code does. The code handles lists of comparable elements and returns a sorted list in ascending order.

The output hints mention that the function will raise a `TypeError` if the input lists contain non-comparable elements. This behavior is consistent with the provided code, as the `sorted` function in Python will raise a `TypeError` if the input list contains non-comparable elements.

There are no obvious edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the code to fail. The code correctly handles the following scenarios:

* Lists containing integers, floats, or strings (comparable elements)
* Lists containing duplicate elements
* Lists containing negative numbers or zero
* Empty lists
* Lists of different lengths

In all these cases, the code will return a single sorted list containing all elements from the input lists. Since the code meets the requirements of the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, the correctness is **True**.
