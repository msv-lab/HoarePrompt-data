You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list. It uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which sorts the elements of a given iterable in a specific order - Ascending or Descending.

Here's why this function works as expected:

1.  The function takes three lists as input and concatenates them using the `+` operator.
2.  The `sorted` function is then used to sort the concatenated list in ascending order.
3.  The function returns the sorted list.

This approach works correctly for all possible cases, including:

*   Empty lists: The function can handle empty lists as input and will return an empty list if all three input lists are empty.
*   Lists with duplicate elements: The function will treat duplicate elements as separate elements and sort them accordingly.
*   Lists with negative numbers or floats: The function can handle lists containing negative numbers or floats and will sort them correctly.
*   Lists with different data types: However, if the lists contain different data types (e.g., integers and strings), the function may throw an error or produce unexpected results. But based on the problem description, it seems that the input lists are expected to contain comparable elements (e.g., numbers or strings).

Since the function works correctly for all potential cases and does not contain any syntax errors, the correctness of the function is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of elements that can be compared, such as integers or strings.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list containing all elements from list1, list2, and list3, sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three lists of comparable elements, concatenates them, sorts the resulting list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. If the input lists contain non-comparable elements, the function will raise a TypeError.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
