Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, sorts the resulting list in ascending order using the `sorted` function, and returns the sorted list. 

This is exactly what the problem description asks for: to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The function also handles the case where the input lists contain non-comparable elements by raising a TypeError, which is a reasonable behavior for this function.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input handling**: The function accepts three lists as input, which is in line with the problem description.
2. **List concatenation**: The function concatenates the three input lists using the `+` operator, which creates a new list containing all elements from the input lists.
3. **Sorting**: The function sorts the concatenated list in ascending order using the `sorted` function, which is a standard and efficient way to sort lists in Python.
4. **Output**: The function returns the sorted list, which meets the problem description's requirement of producing a single sorted list.

The function is also robust in that it handles potential edge cases, such as:

* Empty input lists: The function will return an empty list, which is a reasonable result.
* Input lists containing non-comparable elements: The function will raise a TypeError, which is a clear indication of an invalid input.
* Input lists containing duplicate elements: The function will include all duplicate elements in the sorted output list, which is a reasonable behavior.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality, handles edge cases, and produces the expected output for all valid inputs.
