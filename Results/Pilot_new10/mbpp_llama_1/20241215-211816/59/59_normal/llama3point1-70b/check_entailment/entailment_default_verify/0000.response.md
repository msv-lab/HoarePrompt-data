The problem description requires a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) and returns a new sorted list containing all elements from the input lists. The sorting is achieved using the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which sorts the elements in ascending order.

The original assessment is "None", indicating no initial judgment was made about the code's correctness.

The output hints describe the expected behavior of the function: it concatenates the input lists, sorts the resulting list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. If the input lists contain non-comparable elements (e.g., trying to compare a string with an integer), the function will raise a TypeError, which is the standard behavior for the `sorted` function in Python when it encounters non-comparable elements.

Given this information, the provided code accurately implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. It merges the three input lists into one and sorts the resulting list in ascending order. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, both for comparable elements and for the case where non-comparable elements might cause a TypeError.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code provided, and the output hints, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
