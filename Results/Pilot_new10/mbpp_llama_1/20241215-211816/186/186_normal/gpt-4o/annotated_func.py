#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, tuple1 and tuple2, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2, up to the length of the shorter tuple, ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple.
