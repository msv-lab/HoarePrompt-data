Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided program is using the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to compare the elements of the tuples, which does not seem to align with the problem description.

A correct implementation should compare the elements of the tuples and return a tuple containing the results of the comparison, such as a tuple of boolean values or a tuple containing the minimum or maximum values of each pair of elements.

For example, if the input tuples are `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, the program should return a tuple containing the results of comparing each pair of elements, such as `(0, 0, 0, 0)` if we are comparing the elements using the less-than operator, not using the bitwise AND operator.

The provided program does not handle this case correctly, as it returns `(1, 2, 3, 0)` which is not a correct result of comparing the elements of the input tuples. 

A correct example would be to compare the elements of the tuples and return a tuple containing the minimum values of each pair of elements:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(min(a, b) for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
