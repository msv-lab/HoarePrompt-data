To determine the output state, we must understand what the given Python code snippet does. The code uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` function to create a new tuple. It utilizes the `zip()` function to iterate over two tuples (`tuple1` and `tuple2`) in parallel and performs a bitwise AND operation (`&`) on corresponding elements.

Given that `tuple1` and `tuple2` are tuples, the code `return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))` will return a tuple where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.

Since the specific values of `tuple1` and `tuple2` are not provided, we cannot calculate the exact values that will be returned. However, we can describe the nature of the return value:

Output State: **The program returns a tuple where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.**
