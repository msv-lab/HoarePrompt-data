The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, both of which are tuples. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, tup1 and tup2, which are tuples, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tup1 and tup2.**
