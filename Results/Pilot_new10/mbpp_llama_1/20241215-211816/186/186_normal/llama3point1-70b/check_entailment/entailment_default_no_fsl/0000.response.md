Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks for a function to extract the element-wise "and" (or tuples) from the given two tuples. However, the provided Python function performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples. 

The function will not work correctly if the tuples contain non-integer values that do not support bitwise operations, such as strings or floats, because it will raise a TypeError. 

For example, if tup1 = (1, 2, 'a') and tup2 = (3, 4, 'b'), the function will raise an error when it tries to perform a bitwise AND operation on 'a' and 'b'.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the tuples are of different lengths correctly if the task was to return all possible pairs of elements. However, according to the output hints, it should stop at the end of the shorter tuple, which it does. 

However, another issue arises when we consider what "element-wise and tuples" could mean. If we consider it as pairs of elements (tuples) from the two input tuples, then the function does not work as expected because it returns a tuple of integers (result of bitwise AND operation), not a tuple of tuples. 

For instance, if tup1 = (1, 2) and tup2 = (3, 4), the function should return ((1, 3), (2, 4)) if we interpret "element-wise and tuples" as pairs of elements from the two input tuples, but it returns (1, 0) which is the result of the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements. 

Therefore, the provided Python function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
