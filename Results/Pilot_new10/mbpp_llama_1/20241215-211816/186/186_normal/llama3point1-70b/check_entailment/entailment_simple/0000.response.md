Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples, but the provided function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples.

The term "elementwise and tuples" is ambiguous, but it seems to imply a operation that combines the tuples or their elements in some way. The provided function, however, performs a bitwise AND operation, which is a specific operation that may not be the intended behavior.

A correct implementation might involve using the `and` operator between corresponding elements of the tuples, or combining the tuples in some other way, depending on the intended meaning of "elementwise and tuples". 

Here's an example of a case where the function does not meet the problem description:

Let's say we have two tuples `tup1 = (True, False)` and `tup2 = (True, False)`. The function `func_1` would return `(1, 0)`, which are the results of the bitwise AND operation. However, if the intended behavior is to perform a logical AND operation, the result should be `(True, False)`. 

In this case, the function does not meet the problem description, and therefore, the correctness is **False**. 

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to perform the intended operation, such as using the `and` operator for logical AND:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x and y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
```
