Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases because it only performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples. The problem description asks to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples, but it does not specify what operation should be performed on the elements. 

However, if we assume that the problem description implies performing a bitwise AND operation, there's still a potential issue. The program will throw an error if the tuples are not of the same length, because the zip() function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5)
print(func_1(tup1, tup2))  # This will only return (0, 0) and ignore the third element in tup1
```
This example shows that the program does not handle tuples of different lengths correctly. It should either return an error or handle the extra elements in some way.

To fix this, we could modify the function to check if the tuples are of the same length and handle the extra elements if they are not.
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    if len(tup1)!= len(tup2):
        raise ValueError("Tuples must be of the same length")
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```
This version of the function will raise an error if the tuples are not of the same length. 

Alternatively, we could modify the function to perform a different operation on the elements, such as multiplying them or concatenating them, depending on what the problem description is intended to mean. But without more information, we cannot determine what the correct operation is.
