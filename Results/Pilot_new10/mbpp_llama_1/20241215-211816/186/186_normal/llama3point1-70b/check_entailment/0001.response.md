Correctness: **False**

The given function `func_1` attempts to extract the element-wise AND operation of two tuples using the bitwise AND operator `&`. However, this approach has several issues.

Firstly, the function assumes that all elements in the tuples are integers, because the bitwise AND operator `&` is not defined for other types. If the tuples contain non-integer elements, the function will throw an error.

Secondly, even if the tuples only contain integers, the function may still not produce the correct results if the tuples have different lengths. The `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple.

Thirdly, the problem description mentions extracting "elementwise and tuples", which is not entirely clear. However, assuming it means performing an element-wise operation between the two tuples, the function should handle cases where the tuples have different lengths or contain different types of elements.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5)
print(func_1(tup1, tup2))  # Output: (0, 0)
# The function ignores the extra element 3 in tup1

tup1 = (1, 'a', 3)
tup2 = (4, 5, 6)
print(func_1(tup1, tup2))  # Throws an error because 'a' is not an integer
```
