You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given function `func_1` attempts to extract the element-wise AND operation of two tuples using the bitwise AND operator `&`. However, this approach has several issues.

Firstly, the function assumes that all elements in the tuples are integers, because the bitwise AND operator `&` is not defined for other types. If the tuples contain non-integer elements, the function will throw an error.

Secondly, even if the tuples only contain integers, the function may still not produce the correct results if the tuples have different lengths. The `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple.

Thirdly, the problem description mentions extracting "elementwise and tuples", which is not entirely clear. However, assuming it means performing an element-wise operation between the two tuples, the function should handle cases where the tuples have different lengths or contain different types of elements.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5)
print(func_1(tup1, tup2))  # Output: (0, 0)
# The function ignores the extra element 3 in tup1

tup1 = (1, 'a', 3)
tup2 = (4, 5, 6)
print(func_1(tup1, tup2))  # Throws an error because 'a' is not an integer
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, stopping at the end of the shorter tuple if they are of different lengths, and assuming all elements can undergo bitwise AND operations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
