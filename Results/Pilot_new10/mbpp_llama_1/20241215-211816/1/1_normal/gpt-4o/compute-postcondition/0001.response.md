To calculate the output state, let's consider the given information and the provided code snippet. 

The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `list1` is a list.
- `list2` is a list.
- `common_elements` is a set equal to `set(list1) & set(list2)`, which means it contains elements that are common to both `list1` and `list2`.

The code snippet is `return tuple(sorted(common_elements))`. This means the program will return a tuple that contains the common elements between `list1` and `list2`, sorted in ascending order.

Given that `common_elements` is a set of common elements between `list1` and `list2`, and considering the nature of sets (which are unordered collections of unique elements), the `sorted()` function will arrange these common elements in ascending order. The `tuple()` function then converts this sorted list into a tuple, which is a collection that is ordered and immutable.

Therefore, the output of the program will be a tuple containing the elements common to `list1` and `list2`, in sorted order.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple of common elements between list1 and list2, in ascending order.**
