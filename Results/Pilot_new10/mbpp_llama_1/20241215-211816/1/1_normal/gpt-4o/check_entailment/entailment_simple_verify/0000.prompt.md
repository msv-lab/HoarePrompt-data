You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)
assert func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)

def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements from two given lists. It achieves this by converting the input lists into sets, performing a set intersection operation (`&`) to identify the common elements, sorting these elements, and finally returning them as a tuple.

The function works as expected for various cases, including when there are multiple shared elements, when there are no shared elements, and when the input lists contain duplicate elements (although the function's use of sets means that duplicates within each list are ignored).

Here are some key aspects of the function's correctness:

1. **Set Intersection**: The use of `set(list1) & set(list2)` correctly identifies the elements that are common to both lists, regardless of their original order or frequency.
2. **Sorting**: The function returns the shared elements in sorted order, which can be useful for presenting the results in a consistent manner.
3. **Tuple Return**: By converting the sorted common elements back into a tuple, the function preserves the order of the elements and ensures that the output is immutable, which can be beneficial in certain contexts.

To confirm the correctness, consider the following examples:
- When both lists are empty, the function correctly returns an empty tuple.
- When one list is empty and the other is not, the function correctly returns an empty tuple, because there are no shared elements.
- When the lists contain elements of different data types (e.g., integers and strings), the function still works correctly, as long as the elements are hashable (which is a requirement for including elements in a set).

Given the provided code and the problem description, the function appears to handle all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing elements of the same data type but in different orders. Therefore, the correctness of the function is confirmed.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)
assert func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))
    #The program returns a tuple of common elements between list1 and list2, in ascending order.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
