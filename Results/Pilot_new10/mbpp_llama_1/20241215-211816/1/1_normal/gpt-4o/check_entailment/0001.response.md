Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It successfully finds the shared elements from two given lists.

Here's why the code works correctly:

1. The program uses the set intersection operation (`&`) to find the common elements between the two lists. This operation returns a new set containing only the elements that are present in both sets.
2. The `set` function is used to convert the input lists into sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements. This ensures that the program only returns unique shared elements.
3. The `sorted` function is used to sort the common elements in ascending order, which ensures that the output is consistent and predictable.
4. The `tuple` function is used to convert the sorted common elements into a tuple, which is the desired output format.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the program works correctly for different input cases.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I couldn't find any scenario where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
