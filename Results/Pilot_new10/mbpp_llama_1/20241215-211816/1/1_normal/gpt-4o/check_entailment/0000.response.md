Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements from two given lists. It achieves this by converting the input lists into sets, performing a set intersection operation (`&`) to identify the common elements, sorting these elements, and finally returning them as a tuple.

The function works as expected for various cases, including when there are multiple shared elements, when there are no shared elements, and when the input lists contain duplicate elements (although the function's use of sets means that duplicates within each list are ignored).

Here are some key aspects of the function's correctness:

1. **Set Intersection**: The use of `set(list1) & set(list2)` correctly identifies the elements that are common to both lists, regardless of their original order or frequency.
2. **Sorting**: The function returns the shared elements in sorted order, which can be useful for presenting the results in a consistent manner.
3. **Tuple Return**: By converting the sorted common elements back into a tuple, the function preserves the order of the elements and ensures that the output is immutable, which can be beneficial in certain contexts.

To confirm the correctness, consider the following examples:
- When both lists are empty, the function correctly returns an empty tuple.
- When one list is empty and the other is not, the function correctly returns an empty tuple, because there are no shared elements.
- When the lists contain elements of different data types (e.g., integers and strings), the function still works correctly, as long as the elements are hashable (which is a requirement for including elements in a set).

Given the provided code and the problem description, the function appears to handle all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing elements of the same data type but in different orders. Therefore, the correctness of the function is confirmed.
