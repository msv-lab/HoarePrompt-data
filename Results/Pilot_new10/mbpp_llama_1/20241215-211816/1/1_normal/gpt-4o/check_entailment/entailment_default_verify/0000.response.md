Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment is None, meaning there was no initial assessment provided. 

The problem description requires a function to find the shared elements from two given lists. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists, converts them to sets, finds the intersection of the sets, and returns the common elements as a sorted tuple.

The output hints describe the function's behavior, stating that it returns a tuple of common elements in ascending order and may raise a TypeError if the elements are not hashable or comparable.

Given the information, the code seems to accurately implement the problem description. It correctly finds the shared elements between two lists and returns them in ascending order. The use of sets ensures efficient lookup and intersection calculation, and the sorting of the result ensures that the output is in ascending order.

The output hints do not indicate any cases where the code might not work correctly, assuming valid input is provided.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the program is correct.

Final: **True**
