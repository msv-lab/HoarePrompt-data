Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, it appears that the program is correct. The annotated version of the code indicates that the function `func_1` takes two lists as input, finds the common elements between them using a set intersection operation, and returns the common elements as a tuple in ascending order. 

The original assessment is "None", which implies that no assessment was made. Since the program seems to be doing what it's supposed to do based on the problem description and the annotated code, there is no reason to change this to a "False" assessment. 

The annotated version provides additional information about the state of the program and the function's behavior, but it does not reveal any issues with the original code. The function assumes that the input lists contain hashable and comparable elements, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description. 

The unit tests provided also suggest that the function is working correctly, as they cover different scenarios and the function returns the expected results.

Therefore, based on the information available, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
