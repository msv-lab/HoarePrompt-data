To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to evaluate it against the problem description and the output hints.

The problem description asks for a function to find the shared elements from two given lists. The function `func_1` takes two lists, converts them into sets (which automatically removes any duplicate elements), finds the intersection of the two sets (which gives the common elements), and then converts this intersection back into a tuple. The tuple is sorted before being returned, ensuring the common elements are in ascending order.

The original assessment is "None", meaning there's no prior judgment on the program's correctness to evaluate against.

The output hints further clarify the expected behavior of the function:
- It accepts two lists and returns a tuple of common elements in ascending order.
- If there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple.
- The function assumes the elements are hashable and comparable and may raise a TypeError if not.

Based on this information, the program does indeed fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description:
- It finds the shared elements between two lists.
- It returns these elements in a tuple.
- The elements are returned in ascending order (due to the `sorted` function).

However, it's also important to consider potential edge cases:
- The function handles cases where there are no common elements by returning an empty tuple, which aligns with the expected behavior.
- The function does not explicitly handle cases where inputs are not lists or where elements are not hashable and comparable. However, the output hints and the overall context of the problem imply that such cases are outside the scope of this assessment, emphasizing instead the function's behavior under the assumption of valid inputs.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment should be viewed as accurate in the context of fulfilling the specified requirements, assuming valid inputs are provided.

Final: **True**
