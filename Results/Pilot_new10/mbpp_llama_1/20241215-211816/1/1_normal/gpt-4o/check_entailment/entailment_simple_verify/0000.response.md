The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements from two given lists, and it correctly achieves this by converting the input lists into sets, performing a set intersection operation to identify the common elements, sorting these elements, and finally returning them as a tuple.

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment. The states described in the annotated code, such as the program returning a tuple of common elements between `list1` and `list2` in ascending order, align with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

There are no indications in the provided code or the annotated version that would suggest the original assessment is inaccurate. The function handles the conversion of lists to sets, correctly identifies common elements, sorts them, and returns the result in a tuple as expected.

Therefore, considering all the information available, the final correctness of the program based on the problem description is confirmed.

Final: **True**
