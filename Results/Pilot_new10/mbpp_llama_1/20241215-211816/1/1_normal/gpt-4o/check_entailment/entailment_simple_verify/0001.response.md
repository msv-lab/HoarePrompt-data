The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment. 

The code defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input and returns a tuple of common elements between the two lists, in ascending order. The function uses the set intersection operation to find the common elements, which is an efficient and correct approach.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different input cases. The annotations in the code do not reveal any potential issues or edge cases that would suggest the function is incorrect.

Therefore, based on the information available, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
