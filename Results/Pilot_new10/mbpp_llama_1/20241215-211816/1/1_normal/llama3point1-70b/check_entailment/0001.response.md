Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple containing the shared elements from both tuples.

The function works by first converting the input tuples to sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements. It then uses the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives a new set containing only the elements that are common to both sets. Finally, it converts this resulting set back to a tuple and returns it.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* When the input tuples have no shared elements, the function returns an empty tuple.
* When the input tuples have one or more shared elements, the function returns a tuple containing all the shared elements.
* When the input tuples are empty, the function returns an empty tuple.

The use of sets to find the intersection of the two input tuples is efficient and effective, as it eliminates the need for explicit loops or conditional statements to compare elements.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description, handling all potential cases and edge cases correctly.
