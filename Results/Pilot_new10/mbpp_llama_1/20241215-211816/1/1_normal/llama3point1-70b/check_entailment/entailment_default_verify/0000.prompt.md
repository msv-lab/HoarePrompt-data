You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple containing the shared elements from the two input tuples. 

Here's an explanation of why this code works correctly:

1. The function converts the input tuples to sets using `set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)`.
2. It then uses the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives us the elements that are common to both sets.
3. Finally, it converts the intersection back to a tuple using `tuple()` and returns it.

This approach works because sets in Python automatically eliminate duplicates, and the intersection operation gives us the elements that are present in both sets. 

This function handles all potential cases correctly:

- It handles duplicate elements in the input lists correctly, because sets automatically eliminate duplicates.
- It handles empty input lists correctly, because the intersection of two empty sets is an empty set, which is converted to an empty tuple and returned.
- It handles input lists with no common elements correctly, because the intersection of two sets with no common elements is an empty set, which is converted to an empty tuple and returned.

Therefore, this function is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two iterables, finds the unique elements common to both, and returns them as a tuple; it returns an empty tuple if there are no common elements or if either input is empty, and it may throw an error if the inputs are not iterables.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
