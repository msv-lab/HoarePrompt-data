You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple containing the shared elements from the two input tuples. 

Here's an explanation of why this code works correctly:

1. The function converts the input tuples to sets using `set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)`.
2. It then uses the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives us the elements that are common to both sets.
3. Finally, it converts the intersection back to a tuple using `tuple()` and returns it.

This approach works because sets in Python automatically eliminate duplicates, and the intersection operation gives us the elements that are present in both sets. 

This function handles all potential cases correctly:

- It handles duplicate elements in the input lists correctly, because sets automatically eliminate duplicates.
- It handles empty input lists correctly, because the intersection of two empty sets is an empty set, which is converted to an empty tuple and returned.
- It handles input lists with no common elements correctly, because the intersection of two sets with no common elements is an empty set, which is converted to an empty tuple and returned.

Therefore, this function is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are lists.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the elements common to both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` lists, with no duplicate elements.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
