The original assessment is "None", which means there is no initial assessment of the program's correctness. 

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to be correct. The function `func_1` takes two lists (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) as input and returns a tuple containing the elements common to both lists, with no duplicate elements. This is achieved by converting the lists to sets (which automatically removes duplicates) and then finding the intersection of the two sets using the `&` operator.

The annotated version of the code confirms this understanding. It states that the program returns a tuple containing the elements common to both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` lists, with no duplicate elements, which is consistent with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment of "None" can be replaced with a new assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
