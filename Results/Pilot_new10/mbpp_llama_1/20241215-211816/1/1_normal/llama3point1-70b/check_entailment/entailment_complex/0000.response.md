The given function `func_1` takes two lists `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input, converts them into sets, finds their intersection using the `&` operator, and returns the result as a tuple.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function finds the shared elements from the given two lists.
2. The use of sets (`set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)`) ensures that duplicate elements are removed from each list.
3. The intersection of the two sets (`set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2)`) gives the elements common to both lists.
4. The result is returned as a tuple, which matches the problem description.

Additionally, the program handles edge cases correctly:

* If there are no common elements, an empty tuple is returned, which is the expected output.
* If either input is empty, an empty tuple is returned, which is also the expected output.
* If the inputs are not iterables (e.g., integers, floats), the program will throw an error when trying to convert them to sets, which is a reasonable behavior given the problem description.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and handles potential edge cases correctly, making it a correct implementation.
