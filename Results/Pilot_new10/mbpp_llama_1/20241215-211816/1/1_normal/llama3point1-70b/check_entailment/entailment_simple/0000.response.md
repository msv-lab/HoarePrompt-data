Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it indeed finds the shared elements from the given two lists as described in the problem description. Here's why it works:

- The function `func_1` takes two lists `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as arguments.
- It converts these lists into sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements within each list.
- The `&` operator is then used to find the intersection of these two sets, which results in a new set containing only the elements common to both lists.
- Finally, this resulting set of common elements is converted back into a tuple and returned by the function.

This process ensures that the function returns a tuple containing the elements that are present in both input lists, with no duplicates. This meets the problem description's requirement to find the shared elements from the given two lists. 

One minor point to note is the naming convention used in the function and variable names. The problem description mentions lists, but the variable names `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` suggest tuples. However, the code correctly treats these as lists, so this does not affect the correctness of the program in terms of its functionality as described. 

In summary, the program correctly fulfills the task as described in the problem description for all potential cases, thus it is correct.
