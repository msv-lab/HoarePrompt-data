The impact of the code is that it returns the value of `b`. From the initial state, we know that `b` is the nth Fibonacci number. Since `n` is a positive integer, `b` will be a specific Fibonacci number corresponding to the value of `n`. 

Output State: **The program returns the nth Fibonacci number**
