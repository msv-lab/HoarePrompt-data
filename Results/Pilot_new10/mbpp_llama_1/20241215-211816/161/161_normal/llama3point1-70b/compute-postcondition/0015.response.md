The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the following cases: 
Case_1: The program returns 2; 
Case_2: The program returns 1; 
Case_3: The program returns the nth Fibonacci number. 
Since the specific conditions for each case are not provided, we can infer that the return value will be one of the three options, with Case_1, Case_2, and Case_3 being mutually exclusive. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return either 2, 1, or the nth Fibonacci number based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a non-negative integer, and returns either 2, 1, or the nth Fibonacci number.**
