To understand the functionality of the given function `func_1(n)`, let's analyze it step by step:

1. The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
2. If `n` is 0, the function returns 2. This is an explicit case handled by the function.
3. If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. This is another explicit case.
4. For any `n` greater than 1, the function uses a loop to calculate the `n`th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two numbers to get the next number, starting with 2 and 1 as the first two numbers in this implementation.

However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the traditional Fibonacci sequence (which starts with 0 and 1) and the sequence implied by this function (which starts with 2 and 1 for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, respectively). 

Given the code, the function essentially calculates a sequence where:
- The 0th term is 2.
- The 1st term is 1.
- Every term after that is the sum of the two preceding ones.

This means the function does not calculate the traditional Fibonacci sequence for all `n`, but rather a modified sequence based on its initial conditions.

Therefore, considering all potential cases and the actual code logic:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on a modified Fibonacci-like sequence where the 0th term is 2, the 1st term is 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding ones, thus returning 2 for `n = 0`, 1 for `n = 1`, and the `n`th term of this sequence for `n > 1`. **
