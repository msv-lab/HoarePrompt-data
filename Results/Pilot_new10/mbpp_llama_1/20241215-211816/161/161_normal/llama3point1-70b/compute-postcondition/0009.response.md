According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the current iteration number is less than or equal to `n`. The loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3. The loop variable `_` is not explicitly used in the given state, but we know it takes the value of the current iteration number. 

Since the loop has already executed at least once, the current iteration number `_` must have been 2 at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, the next iteration number must be 3, which is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `a` and `b` does not affect the loop's execution condition, so their values remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
