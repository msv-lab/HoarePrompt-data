The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` and then adds the original value of `a` to the new value of `b`. Initially, `a` is 3 and `b` is 4. 

After execution, `a` becomes the original value of `b`, which is 4, and `b` becomes the original value of `a` (which is 3) plus the original value of `b` (which is 4), so `b` becomes 7.

The state of `n` is not affected, so `n` remains a positive integer greater than 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is 4, `b` is 7**
