According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4. The loop variable `_` is not explicitly used in the state, but we know it takes the values from 2 to `n`. Since the loop has already executed at least once (when `_` was 2), for it to execute again, `_` must be 3 or more, and `n` must be greater than 3 to allow the next iteration. Since `a` and `b` do not affect the loop condition directly, their values remain unchanged in terms of affecting the loop's execution. However, we must consider that `a` is 3, which is the next value that `_` would take if the loop were to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
