Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description because it is supposed to find the n'th Lucas number, but instead, it calculates the n'th Fibonacci number.

The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The Lucas sequence begins like this: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11,...

In the provided program, when `n` is 0 or 1, it correctly returns the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence (2 and 1, respectively). However, for `n` greater than 1, the program uses the Fibonacci sequence formula to calculate the n'th number, which is incorrect for the Lucas sequence.

To correctly calculate the n'th Lucas number, the program should initialize `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1) and then use a loop to calculate the subsequent numbers in the sequence. The provided program does this, but it returns the n'th Fibonacci number instead of the n'th Lucas number because the initial values of `a` and `b` are correct for the Lucas sequence, but the comment and the variable names suggest that the program is calculating Fibonacci numbers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def lucas(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

In this corrected version, the function name is changed to `lucas` to reflect its purpose, and the variable names are left as `a` and `b`, but the comment is updated to indicate that the program is calculating Lucas numbers.
