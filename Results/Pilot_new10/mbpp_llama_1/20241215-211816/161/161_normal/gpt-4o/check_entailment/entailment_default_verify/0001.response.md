To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we carefully reviewed the problem description, the original assessment, and the given output hints. 

The problem description asks to write a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with 2 and 1. 

The original assessment deemed the program correct. It provided a detailed breakdown of how the program works, including handling base cases and calculating the n'th Lucas number iteratively. The assessment concluded that the program handles all potential cases correctly.

The output hints further clarify the program's functionality. They state that the function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, with specific return values for `n` equals 0 and 1, and a pattern for `n` larger than 1.

After examining the provided code, we notice that it aligns with both the problem description and the output hints. The code correctly implements the calculation of the n'th Lucas number using an iterative approach, matching the behavior described in the output hints.

The original assessment accurately reflects the functionality and correctness of the code. The program correctly handles the calculation of the n'th Lucas number for non-negative integers `n`, following the specified sequence.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the alignment of the code with the problem description and output hints, we conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
