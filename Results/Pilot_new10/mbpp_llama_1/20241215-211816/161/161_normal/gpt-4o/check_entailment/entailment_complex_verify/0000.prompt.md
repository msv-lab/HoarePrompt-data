You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The function uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. It handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively.
2. For `n > 1`, it initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1).
3. It then enters a loop that runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive), updating `a` and `b` in each iteration to hold the last two Lucas numbers calculated so far.
4. After the loop finishes, `b` holds the n'th Lucas number, which is then returned.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function works correctly for certain inputs. The function's logic is sound and correctly implements the Lucas sequence calculation. 

Therefore, based on the given code and problem description, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases, and no example can be found where the program does not work as expected.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 1, `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, where n is a non-negative integer larger than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, where `n` equals 0 returns 2, `n` equals 1 returns 1, and for `n` larger than 1, it returns the nth number in the sequence

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
