Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be a correct implementation of a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is a series of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point (2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1). The program uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

- It starts by checking the base cases where `n` equals 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1, respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.
- For `n` greater than 1, it initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1). It then enters a loop that runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive).
- Inside the loop, it updates `a` and `b` to `b` and `a + b`, respectively, effectively calculating the next number in the sequence.
- After the loop completes, `b` will hold the n'th Lucas number, which is then returned.

The program appears to handle all potential cases correctly, including the base cases and the recursive case of calculating the n'th Lucas number. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the function's correctness for specific inputs.

Given the provided code and problem description, there doesn't seem to be any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is considered **True**.
