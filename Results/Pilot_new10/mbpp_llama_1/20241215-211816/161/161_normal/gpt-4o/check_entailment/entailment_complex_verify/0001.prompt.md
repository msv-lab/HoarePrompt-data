You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be a correct implementation of a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is a series of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point (2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1). The program uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

- It starts by checking the base cases where `n` equals 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1, respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.
- For `n` greater than 1, it initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1). It then enters a loop that runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive).
- Inside the loop, it updates `a` and `b` to `b` and `a + b`, respectively, effectively calculating the next number in the sequence.
- After the loop completes, `b` will hold the n'th Lucas number, which is then returned.

The program appears to handle all potential cases correctly, including the base cases and the recursive case of calculating the n'th Lucas number. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the function's correctness for specific inputs.

Given the provided code and problem description, there doesn't seem to be any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is considered **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 1, `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, where n is a non-negative integer larger than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, where `n` equals 0 returns 2, `n` equals 1 returns 1, and for `n` larger than 1, it returns the nth number in the sequence

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
