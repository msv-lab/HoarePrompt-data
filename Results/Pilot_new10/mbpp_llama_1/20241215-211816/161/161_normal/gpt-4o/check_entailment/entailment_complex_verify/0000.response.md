The original assessment states that the function `func_1(n)` is correct for calculating the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The provided unit tests support this assessment.

The annotated version of the code describes the state of the program at different points, which further confirms the correctness of the function. It states that `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci-like number and `b` is the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, which matches the definition of the Lucas sequence.

After reviewing both the original assessment and the annotated version of the code, it appears that the original assessment is accurate. The function correctly implements the Lucas sequence calculation, and the annotations provide additional confirmation of its correctness.

Therefore, the reason for keeping the original assessment is that both the original code and the annotated version conform to the problem description, and there is no evidence to suggest that the function does not work as expected for all valid inputs.

Final: **True**
