Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is a sequence of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, but with a different starting point. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, instead of 0 and 1.

The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly implements this sequence. It handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For `n` greater than 1, it uses a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number by iteratively updating the values of `a` and `b`, which represent the (n-1)th and nth Lucas numbers respectively.

After the loop has been executed, the function returns `b`, which is the nth Lucas number. The function's logic is sound and correctly implements the Lucas sequence, making it correct according to the problem description.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function for specific values of `n`. Since the function's logic is general and applies to all non-negative integers `n`, it is correct for all potential cases.
