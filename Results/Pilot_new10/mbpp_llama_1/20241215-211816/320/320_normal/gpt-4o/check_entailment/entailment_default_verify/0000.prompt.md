You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2
assert func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5
assert func_1([2, 2]) == None
assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None

def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. Here's why it works for all potential cases:

1. **Handling duplicates**: By converting the list to a set, duplicates are removed, ensuring that each number is only considered once.
2. **Sorting unique numbers**: The `sorted` function arranges the unique numbers in ascending order, making it easy to access the second smallest number.
3. **Edge case: less than two unique numbers**: If there is only one unique number or if the list is empty, the function correctly returns `None`, as there is no second smallest number.

The function also correctly handles various input scenarios, such as:

* Negative numbers
* Floating-point numbers
* Duplicate numbers
* Lists with only one unique number

All the provided unit tests also pass, which further confirms the function's correctness.

In summary, the function is well-designed to handle various edge cases and correctly finds the second smallest number in a list, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, removes duplicates, sorts the unique numbers, and returns the second smallest unique integer if there are at least two unique integers; otherwise, it returns `None`. It implicitly handles empty lists and lists with one unique element by returning `None`, but may throw errors for lists containing non-comparable types or `None` input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
