Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct as it meets the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the second smallest number in a list. 

Here's why the code works correctly:

1. It first removes duplicate numbers from the list using `set(nums)`. This is necessary to ensure that the second smallest number is indeed distinct from the smallest number.

2. It then sorts the unique numbers in ascending order using `sorted()`. This is necessary to easily identify the smallest and the second smallest numbers.

3. Finally, it checks if there are more than one unique numbers in the list. If there are, it returns the second smallest number (i.e., the number at index 1 in the sorted list). If there is only one unique number (or no numbers at all), it returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest number.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the program. For example, in the test case `assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2`, the function correctly identifies `-2` as the second smallest number. In the test case `assert func_1([2, 2]) == None`, the function correctly returns `None` because there is only one unique number in the list.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
