Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for a function to find the second smallest number in a list. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input.
2. It first creates a set of unique numbers from the list `nums` using `set(nums)`. This removes any duplicate numbers from the list.
3. Then, it sorts the unique numbers in ascending order using `sorted()`.
4. If there are more than one unique numbers in the list (i.e., `len(unique_nums) > 1`), it returns the second smallest number, which is the number at index 1 (`unique_nums[1]`).
5. If there is only one unique number in the list (i.e., `len(unique_nums) == 1`), it returns `None`.

This logic is correct because:

- If there are at least two distinct numbers in the list, the function will return the second smallest number.
- If there is only one distinct number in the list, the function will return `None`, which is a reasonable behavior since there is no second smallest number in this case.

The provided assertions demonstrate the correctness of the function for different scenarios:

- The function returns the correct second smallest number when there are multiple distinct numbers in the list.
- The function returns `None` when there is only one distinct number in the list, even if it appears multiple times.

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore correct.
