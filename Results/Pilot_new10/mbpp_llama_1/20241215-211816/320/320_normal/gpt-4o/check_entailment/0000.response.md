Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. Here's why it works for all potential cases:

1. **Handling duplicates**: By converting the list to a set, duplicates are removed, ensuring that each number is only considered once.
2. **Sorting unique numbers**: The `sorted` function arranges the unique numbers in ascending order, making it easy to access the second smallest number.
3. **Edge case: less than two unique numbers**: If there is only one unique number or if the list is empty, the function correctly returns `None`, as there is no second smallest number.

The function also correctly handles various input scenarios, such as:

* Negative numbers
* Floating-point numbers
* Duplicate numbers
* Lists with only one unique number

All the provided unit tests also pass, which further confirms the function's correctness.

In summary, the function is well-designed to handle various edge cases and correctly finds the second smallest number in a list, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.
