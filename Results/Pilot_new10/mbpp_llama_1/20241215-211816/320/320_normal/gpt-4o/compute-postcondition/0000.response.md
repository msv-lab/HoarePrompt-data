The code `unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))` creates a new variable `unique_nums` and assigns it the value of a sorted set of unique elements from the list `nums`. The set operation removes any duplicate elements from `nums`, and the sorted operation arranges these unique elements in ascending order.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from `nums`**
