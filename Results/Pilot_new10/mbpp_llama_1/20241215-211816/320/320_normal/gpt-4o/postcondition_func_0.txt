The function accepts a list of integers, removes duplicates, sorts the unique numbers, and returns the second smallest unique integer if there are at least two unique integers; otherwise, it returns `None`. It implicitly handles empty lists and lists with one unique element by returning `None`, but may throw errors for lists containing non-comparable types or `None` input.
