You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:
        return None
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it correctly implements the function to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The program first converts the input list `nums` to a set `unique_nums` to remove any duplicate numbers. It then converts this set back to a list.
2. It checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If this condition is true, it means there are either no numbers or only one unique number in the list, so it returns `None` because there is no second smallest number.
3. If the length of `unique_nums` is 2 or more, it sorts the list in ascending order and returns the second element, which is the second smallest number.

This logic correctly handles all potential cases:

- If the input list is empty, `unique_nums` will also be empty, and the function will return `None`.
- If the input list contains only one unique number, `unique_nums` will contain only one element, and the function will return `None`.
- If the input list contains two or more unique numbers, the function will correctly return the second smallest number.
- If the input list contains duplicate numbers, the set conversion will remove these duplicates, and the function will still correctly return the second smallest unique number.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and does not contain any obvious logical errors, it can be considered correct according to the given problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers and returns None if the list has less than two distinct elements, or the second smallest unique integer from the list otherwise

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
