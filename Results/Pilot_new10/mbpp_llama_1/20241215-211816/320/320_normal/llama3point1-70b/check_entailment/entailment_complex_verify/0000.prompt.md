You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:
        return None
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is designed to find the second smallest number in a list. It first removes duplicates from the list by converting it to a set and then back to a list. If the resulting list has less than 2 unique elements, it returns None, because there is no second smallest number in such a case. Otherwise, it sorts the list of unique numbers and returns the second element, which is the second smallest number.

This program handles all potential edge cases correctly:
- If the list is empty or contains only one unique number, it returns None.
- If the list contains duplicate numbers, they are removed, and the correct second smallest number is found.
- If the list is already sorted or unsorted, the program still works correctly because it sorts the list before finding the second smallest number.

Overall, the program is well-designed and correctly implements the desired functionality, handling all potential edge cases. Therefore, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`, with length less than or equal to the length of `nums`, and the length of `unique_nums` is more than or equal to 2
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns None if the list has less than two distinct elements, or the second smallest unique integer from the list otherwise

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
