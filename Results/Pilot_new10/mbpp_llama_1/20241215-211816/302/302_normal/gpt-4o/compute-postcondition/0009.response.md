Given the initial state, we can analyze the impact of the code on the program. The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to be one more than the current `mid`. 

Since `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` was initially 0, `high` was initially `len(arr) - 1`, `result` was initially -1, and `mid` was initially `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and considering that the value at the index `mid` in `arr` is not equal to `target` and is less than `target`, we need to update `low` accordingly to continue the search for `target` in the list.

The new value of `low` becomes `mid + 1`. The states of the other variables (`arr`, `target`, `high`, `result`, and `mid`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, and `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`**
