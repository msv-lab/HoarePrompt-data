`result` is assigned the value of `mid`, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.
Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` is `(low + high) // 2`**
