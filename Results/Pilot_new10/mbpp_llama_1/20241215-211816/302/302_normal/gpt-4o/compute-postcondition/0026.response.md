The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, so the new value of `low` is `((low + high) // 2) + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is `(mid + 1)` which equals `((low + high) // 2) + 1`, and `high` is such that the new `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is `((low + high) // 2) + 1`, `high` is such that `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`**
