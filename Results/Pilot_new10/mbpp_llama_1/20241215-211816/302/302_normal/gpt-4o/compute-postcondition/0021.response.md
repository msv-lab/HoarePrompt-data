Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` equals the original `mid` which is `(low + original high) // 2`, where `high` is `((low + original high) // 2) - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `((low + high) // 2) + 1`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, then `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.***
