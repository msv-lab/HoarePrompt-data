The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. According to the code, it uses a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence; otherwise, it returns -1.

Upon analyzing the code line by line, it appears that the code correctly implements the binary search algorithm. However, it's essential to consider edge cases, such as an empty input list or a list with duplicate elements. In the case of an empty list, the function will return -1, which is the expected behavior. For a list with duplicate elements, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of `target`, which is also the expected behavior.

One potential edge case to consider is when the input list is not sorted. While the annotations assume that the input list is sorted, the code does not explicitly check for this condition. If the input list is not sorted, the function's behavior may be undefined.

Another potential edge case is when the input list contains non-integer elements. The code assumes that all elements in the list are integers, but it does not explicitly check for this condition. If the list contains non-integer elements, the function's behavior may be undefined.

In summary, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` in a sorted list of integers `arr` using a binary search algorithm. The function returns the index of the first occurrence if `target` is found; otherwise, it returns -1. However, the function assumes that the input list is sorted and contains only integer elements, and its behavior may be undefined if these conditions are not met.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise returns -1, assuming that `arr` is sorted and contains only integer elements **
