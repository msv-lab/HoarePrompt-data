To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `while low <= high:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` equals the original `mid` which is `(low + original high) // 2`, where `high` is `((low + original high) // 2) - 1`.
- If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `((low + high) // 2) + 1`.
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, then `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. Given the updates to `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `target`, we need to ensure that after the previous iteration, `low` is not greater than `high`.

However, based on the provided information, if `arr[mid]` equals `target`, the loop's behavior regarding `low` and `high` is not directly specified in terms of updating these variables for the next iteration. Instead, it focuses on setting `result`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to be greater than the current `mid`, potentially moving towards `high`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, `high` is updated to be less than the current `mid`, potentially moving towards `low`.

Given these conditions, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need `low` to be less than or equal to `high` after any updates. Since the exact values of `low` and `high` are not provided, and considering the updates based on the comparisons, for the loop to certainly execute one more time, the relationship between `low` and `high` must allow for at least one more iteration.

Thus, considering the updates:
- If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, the condition for `result` implies that `low` and `high` were positioned such that `mid` (calculated as `(low + high) // 2`) could be within the range of `arr`. This doesn't directly affect `low` and `high` for the next iteration based on the given information.
- If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, updating `low` to `((low + high) // 2) + 1` moves `low` closer to `high`.
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, updating `high` to `(low + high) // 2 - 1` moves `high` closer to `low`.

For the loop to execute again, considering these movements, `low` should not exceed `high` after any update, ensuring that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

Given the provided state and focusing on the condition that must be met for the loop to execute one more time (`low <= high`), and acknowledging that specific updates to `low` and `high` depend on the comparison with `target`, we need to ensure that these variables can still satisfy the loop condition after the previous iteration's updates.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after any updates based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `target`.**
