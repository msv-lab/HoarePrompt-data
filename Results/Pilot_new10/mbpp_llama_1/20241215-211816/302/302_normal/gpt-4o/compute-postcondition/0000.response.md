The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, to the start and end indices of the list `arr`, respectively. 

`low` is assigned the value 0, which is the index of the first element in `arr`. 
`high` is assigned the value `len(arr) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in `arr`.

The states of the other variables, `arr` and `target`, are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`.
Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`**
