Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given code implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a target number in a sorted array. The code initializes `low` and `high` pointers to the start and end of the array, respectively, and a `result` variable to store the index of the target number. 

In each iteration of the while loop, the code calculates the `mid` index and compares the element at this index with the target. If the element is equal to the target, the code updates the `result` variable with the `mid` index and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to continue searching for the first occurrence on the left side of the `mid` index. 

If the element at the `mid` index is less than the target, the code moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` to search on the right side. If the element is greater than the target, the code moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to continue searching on the left side.

The code returns the `result` variable, which stores the index of the first occurrence of the target number. If the target is not found, the `result` variable remains -1.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the code works correctly for different cases, including when the target appears multiple times, when it appears only once, and when it is at the start or end of the array.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as an empty array (not tested but the code will return -1 as expected), a single-element array, and an array with duplicate elements. The code also handles cases where the target is not present in the array, returning -1 as expected.

Overall, the code correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a target number in a sorted array and handles all potential cases correctly.
