Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it implements a modified binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The program initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively. It also initializes a `result` variable to -1, which will store the index of the first occurrence of the target number.
2. The program enters a while loop that continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
3. Inside the loop, the program calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current range `[low, high]`.
4. If the element at the midpoint `arr[mid]` is equal to the target number, the program updates the `result` variable to `mid` and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This is because the first occurrence of the target number could be to the left of the midpoint, so the program continues searching in the left half of the range.
5. If the element at the midpoint is less than the target number, the program moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`, effectively discarding the left half of the range.
6. If the element at the midpoint is greater than the target number, the program moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`, effectively discarding the right half of the range.
7. Once the loop exits, the program returns the `result` variable, which contains the index of the first occurrence of the target number if found, or -1 if not found.

The program always does what the problem description says because it correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of the target number in a sorted array. The key insight is that when the program finds a match, it continues searching in the left half of the range to ensure that it finds the first occurrence, not just any occurrence.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the program works correctly for various test cases, including cases where the target number appears multiple times in the array. Therefore, the program is correct, and its correctness can be verified through rigorous testing and analysis.
