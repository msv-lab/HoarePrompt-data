Correctness: **True**.

I have evaluated the provided code for the function `func_1` which is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The algorithm used is a modified binary search that not only finds the target number but continues to search for it on the left side after the first occurrence is found. This ensures that it identifies the first occurrence rather than just any occurrence of the target number.

The provided code:
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```
handles the search by maintaining a `result` variable that stores the index of the last found occurrence of the target. As long as `arr[mid]` equals the target, it updates `result` and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`, effectively searching for a potential first occurrence to the left of `mid`. 

If `arr[mid]` is less than the target, it moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` to search the right half. If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target, it adjusts the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to continue searching in the left half.

Given the logic and the examples provided:
- The function starts by considering the entire array (`low = 0` and `high = len(arr) - 1`).
- It then follows the binary search approach, adjusting `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and the `target`.
- If `arr[mid]` equals the `target`, it updates `result` with `mid` and continues searching to the left by adjusting `high` to `mid - 1`, ensuring the first occurrence is found.

All the assertions provided in the problem description also validate the correctness of the function:
- `assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1`
- `assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2`
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4`

These assertions cover different scenarios, including when the target number appears multiple times and when it appears only once, demonstrating that `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

Therefore, based on the provided code, explanations, and assertions, I conclude that the program is correct and handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
