You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses a modified binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The code iteratively adjusts the `low` and `high` pointers based on the comparison of the `mid` element with the target element. If the `mid` element matches the target, it updates the `result` with the current `mid` index and adjusts the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to continue searching for the first occurrence on the left side.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears to correctly handle the following edge cases:

1.  **Empty array**: Although not explicitly tested, the code should return `-1` for an empty array since the `while` loop condition would be `False` and the function would return the initial `result` value of `-1`.
2.  **Single-element array**: If the array contains only one element and it matches the target, the function correctly returns `0`. If the single element does not match the target, it returns `-1`.
3.  **Target not found**: If the target element is not present in the array, the function correctly returns `-1`.
4.  **Duplicate elements**: The code correctly handles arrays with duplicate elements by continuing to search for the first occurrence on the left side when a match is found.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correct behavior for various scenarios. Without being able to think of a counterexample where the code does not work as expected, it appears that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise returns -1, assuming that `arr` is sorted and contains only integer elements

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
