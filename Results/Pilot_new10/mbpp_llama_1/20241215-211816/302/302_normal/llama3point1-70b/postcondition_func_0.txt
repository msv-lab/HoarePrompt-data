The function searches for an integer `num` in a sorted list `arr`, returning the index of `num` if found, and implicitly `None` (though intended to be `-1` based on the code's last statement) if `num` is not in `arr`, covering all potential cases including edge cases where `num` is at the start, middle, or end of `arr`, or not in `arr` at all.
