The variable `i` is initially 0. 
Since `x` equals the current value of `num` and `x` is the first element in the list `arr`, and considering that `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, the initial value of `i` which is 0, is the index of the first element `x` in the list `arr`.
Output State: **The program returns 0**
