Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's why I think this code is correct:
- The function iterates through the array from left to right (i.e., from index 0 onwards) using `enumerate(arr)`. This ensures that it will find the first occurrence of the given number `num`, because as soon as it encounters `num`, it returns the index.
- If the number `num` is not found in the array, the function correctly returns `-1`.
- Although the problem description specifies that the array is sorted, the function will still work correctly even if the array is not sorted, because it simply iterates through the array from left to right and returns the index of the first occurrence of `num`.
- Since the function does not rely on the array being sorted to find the first occurrence of `num`, it will work correctly for all potential cases, including when the array is sorted and when it is not.

However, it is worth noting that if the array is indeed sorted, a more efficient solution could be implemented using binary search. The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case, whereas a binary search implementation would have a time complexity of O(log n) for a sorted array. Nonetheless, the provided function still satisfies the problem description for all potential cases.
