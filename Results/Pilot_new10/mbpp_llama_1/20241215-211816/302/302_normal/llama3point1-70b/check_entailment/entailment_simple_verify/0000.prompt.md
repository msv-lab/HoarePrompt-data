You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's why I think this code is correct:
- The function iterates through the array from left to right (i.e., from index 0 onwards) using `enumerate(arr)`. This ensures that it will find the first occurrence of the given number `num`, because as soon as it encounters `num`, it returns the index.
- If the number `num` is not found in the array, the function correctly returns `-1`.
- Although the problem description specifies that the array is sorted, the function will still work correctly even if the array is not sorted, because it simply iterates through the array from left to right and returns the index of the first occurrence of `num`.
- Since the function does not rely on the array being sorted to find the first occurrence of `num`, it will work correctly for all potential cases, including when the array is sorted and when it is not.

However, it is worth noting that if the array is indeed sorted, a more efficient solution could be implemented using binary search. The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case, whereas a binary search implementation would have a time complexity of O(log n) for a sorted array. Nonetheless, the provided function still satisfies the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is an integer, and if `num` is in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num`; otherwise, the function implicitly returns `None`, indicating `num` is not in `arr`. If the loop executes, `i` and `x` will have values based on the last iteration or the iteration where `num` was found, but these are not directly accessible outside the function due to its return behavior.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
