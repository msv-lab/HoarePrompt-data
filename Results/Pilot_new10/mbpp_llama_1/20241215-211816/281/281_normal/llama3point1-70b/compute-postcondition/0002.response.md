The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the input list. 

Looking at the code, it uses a list comprehension to filter out odd numbers and include only numbers that are divisible by 2 (i.e., even numbers). 

The code does not handle cases where the input list is empty or where the input is not a list, or where the list contains non-integer values. 

However, the code will still execute and return an empty list if the input list is empty or if there are no even integers in the list. 

If the input is not a list or if the list contains non-integer values, the code may throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Therefore, considering all potential cases, the functionality of the function is to filter a list of integers and return a list of even integers. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers, returns a list of even integers from the input list, and handles empty lists by returning an empty list, but may throw an error or behave unexpectedly if the input is not a list or if the list contains non-integer values. **
