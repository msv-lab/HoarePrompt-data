You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(numbers)` uses a list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from the input list `numbers`. It correctly checks if a number is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`), which returns `True` if the number is even and `False` otherwise.

The function handles various potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty list: If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list, which is the expected output.
* List with only even numbers: If the input list contains only even numbers, the function returns the entire list.
* List with only odd numbers: If the input list contains only odd numbers, the function returns an empty list.
* List with both even and odd numbers: If the input list contains a mix of even and odd numbers, the function returns a list of only the even numbers.

The function also handles non-integer inputs correctly, as it will raise a `TypeError` if the input list contains non-integer values.

Since I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the given problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, returns a list of even integers from the input list, and handles empty lists by returning an empty list, but may throw an error or behave unexpectedly if the input is not a list or if the list contains non-integer values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
