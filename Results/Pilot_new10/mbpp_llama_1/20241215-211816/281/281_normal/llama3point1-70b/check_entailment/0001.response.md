Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns even numbers from a given list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list, checking if the remainder of the number when divided by 2 is equal to 0 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). This condition is true for even numbers, and the function returns a new list containing only these numbers.

The function handles various potential cases correctly:

1. **Empty list**: If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list, which is the expected result.
2. **List with only odd numbers**: If the input list contains only odd numbers, the function returns an empty list, which is correct because there are no even numbers to return.
3. **List with only even numbers**: If the input list contains only even numbers, the function returns the entire list, which is correct because all numbers are even.
4. **List with mixed even and odd numbers**: If the input list contains a mix of even and odd numbers, the function returns a list containing only the even numbers, which is the expected result.

Since the function correctly handles all these cases and does not have any obvious edge cases that it fails to handle, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
