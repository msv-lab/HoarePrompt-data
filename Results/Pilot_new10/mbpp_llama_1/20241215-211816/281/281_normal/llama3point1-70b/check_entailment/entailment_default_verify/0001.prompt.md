You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns even numbers from a given list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list, checking if the remainder of the number when divided by 2 is equal to 0 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). This condition is true for even numbers, and the function returns a new list containing only these numbers.

The function handles various potential cases correctly:

1. **Empty list**: If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list, which is the expected result.
2. **List with only odd numbers**: If the input list contains only odd numbers, the function returns an empty list, which is correct because there are no even numbers to return.
3. **List with only even numbers**: If the input list contains only even numbers, the function returns the entire list, which is correct because all numbers are even.
4. **List with mixed even and odd numbers**: If the input list contains a mix of even and odd numbers, the function returns a list containing only the even numbers, which is the expected result.

Since the function correctly handles all these cases and does not have any obvious edge cases that it fails to handle, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, returns a list of even integers from the input list, and handles empty lists by returning an empty list, but may throw an error or behave unexpectedly if the input is not a list or if the list contains non-integer values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
