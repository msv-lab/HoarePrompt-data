The original assessment seems accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns all even numbers from a given list of numbers using a list comprehension and the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`).

The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment, as it correctly describes the state of the program before the function call (a list of integers) and the return value (a list of even integers from the input list).

The function appears to handle all potential cases correctly, including lists with only odd numbers, only even numbers, and a mix of both, as well as lists containing zero. 

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is the same as the original assessment.

Final: **True**
