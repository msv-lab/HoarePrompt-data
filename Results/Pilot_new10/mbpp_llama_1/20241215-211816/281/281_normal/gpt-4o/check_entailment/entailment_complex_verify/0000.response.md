The original assessment is "None", which implies that no assessment was made. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that filters even numbers from a list of integers. The annotated code further clarifies the state of the program and its functionality.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated code, it appears that the program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly filters out the even integers from the input list and returns them in a new list. The unit tests provided also support this conclusion, as they show the expected output for different input scenarios.

The annotated code highlights that the function assumes the input list only contains integers and does not handle non-integer values or null inputs explicitly. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Therefore, considering all the available information, I believe the program is correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
