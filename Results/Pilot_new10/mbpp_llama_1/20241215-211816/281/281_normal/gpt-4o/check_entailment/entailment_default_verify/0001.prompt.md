You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]
assert func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]) == [4, 6, 8, 0]
assert func_1([8, 12, 15, 19]) == [8, 12]

def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`. For each number, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). If this condition is true, the number is included in the output list.

The code correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it correctly returns `[2, 4]`.
- For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, it correctly returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`.
- For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, it correctly returns `[8, 12]`.

Upon analyzing the code, there are no apparent edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to fail for any potential input. It correctly identifies even numbers based on the modulo operation, which is a standard and reliable method for determining evenness in mathematics and programming.

Therefore, the function appears to be correct and will work as expected for any list of numbers.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, filters out the even integers, and returns them in a new list. If the input list is empty or contains no even integers, it returns an empty list. The function assumes the input list only contains integers and does not handle non-integer values or null inputs explicitly, which could lead to errors in such cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
