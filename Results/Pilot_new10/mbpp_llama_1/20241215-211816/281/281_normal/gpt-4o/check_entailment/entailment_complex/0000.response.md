Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of even numbers from the input list.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input handling**: The program assumes that the input list only contains integers, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description.
2. **Even number filtering**: The program uses a list comprehension to filter out the even integers from the input list. The condition `num % 2 == 0` correctly identifies even numbers, as a number is even if the remainder of dividing it by 2 is 0.
3. **Output**: The program returns a new list containing the even integers from the input list. If the input list is empty or contains no even integers, the program returns an empty list, which is the expected behavior.
4. **Validation**: The provided assertions (`assert` statements) test the function with various input scenarios, including lists with even and odd numbers, and verify that the function returns the expected output.

The program does not handle non-integer values or null inputs explicitly, but this is not a requirement based on the problem description, which only mentions finding even numbers from a list of numbers (implying integers).

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description asks for, assuming the input list only contains integers.
