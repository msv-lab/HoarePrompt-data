You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to count the number of occurence of the string 'std' in a given string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('letstdlenstdporstd') == 3
assert func_1('truststdsolensporsd') == 1
assert func_1('makestdsostdworthit') == 2
assert func_1('stds') == 1
assert func_1('') == 0

def func_1(s: str) -> int:
    return s.count('std')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses the built-in string method `count()` to find the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. This method is case-sensitive and returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string.

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The `count()` method is the most straightforward way to count the occurrences of a substring in a string in Python, and it handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty strings: The `count()` method returns 0 for empty strings, as expected.
- Strings with no occurrences of 'std': The `count()` method returns 0 for such strings, as expected.
- Strings with one or more occurrences of 'std': The `count()` method returns the correct count of occurrences, as expected.
- Strings with overlapping occurrences of 'std' (which is not the case for 'std' since it has a length of 3, but still): The `count()` method does not count overlapping occurrences.

The provided unit tests cover various scenarios, including different numbers of occurrences and edge cases like empty strings and strings without the substring 'std'. Since the program passes all these tests and handles all potential cases correctly, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string `s` and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`, handling cases where 'std' appears zero or more times, but does not account for non-string inputs or case insensitivity.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
