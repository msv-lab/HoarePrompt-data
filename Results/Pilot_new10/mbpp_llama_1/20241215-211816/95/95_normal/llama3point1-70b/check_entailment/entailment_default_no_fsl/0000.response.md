Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case when the input `s` is not a string. Although the `count` method in Python will throw an error if `s` is not a string, the problem description does not explicitly state that the function should throw an error in such cases. It only asks to count the occurrences of 'std' in the given string. 

However, according to the output hints, the function does throw an error when `s` is not a string. But this behavior is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. To ensure the code is correct for every potential case, we should add input validation to handle cases where `s` is not a string.

For example, the code does not handle the case when `s` is `None` or an integer. In such cases, the function will throw an error, but it does not provide a meaningful error message. 

To fix this issue, we could modify the function to check if `s` is a string before calling the `count` method:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if not isinstance(s, str):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string")
    return s.count('std')
```

This modified function will explicitly handle cases where `s` is not a string and provide a meaningful error message. 

Without this modification, the original function does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description, so its correctness is **False**.
