Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in `s`. This is achieved by using the built-in `count()` method of Python strings, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specified value.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function takes a string `s` as input, which is the input specified in the problem description.
2. The function uses the `count()` method to count the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in `s`. This method is case-sensitive and does not count overlapping occurrences, which is the expected behavior based on the problem description.
3. The function returns the count of 'std' occurrences as an integer, which is the expected output type.

To demonstrate the correctness of the program, consider the following examples:

* If `s = "stdstdstd"`, the function returns `3`, which is the correct count of 'std' occurrences.
* If `s = "abcde"`, the function returns `0`, which is the correct count of 'std' occurrences (i.e., none).
* If `s = "stdabcstd"`, the function returns `2`, which is the correct count of 'std' occurrences.

Overall, the program correctly counts the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string, which meets the requirements of the problem description.
