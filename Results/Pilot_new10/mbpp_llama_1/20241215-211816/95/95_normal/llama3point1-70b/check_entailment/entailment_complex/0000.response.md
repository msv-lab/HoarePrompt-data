Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s` using the built-in `count` method of Python strings. This method is case-sensitive and counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substring.

The program will work correctly for any string input, including empty strings. If the input string does not contain the substring 'std', the function will return 0.

However, it is worth noting that the annotated program mentions that the function will throw an error if `s` is not a string, but the provided code does not include this error-checking behavior. The `count` method will throw an AttributeError if `s` is not a string, but this is not explicitly handled in the function. 

To fully meet the annotations, the function could be modified to include a type check at the beginning, like so:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if not isinstance(s, str):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string")
    return s.count('std')
```

But, based on the problem description alone, which only asks for a function to count the occurrences of 'std' in a given string, the provided code is correct.
