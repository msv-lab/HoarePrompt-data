Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks for the list of maximum length in a list of lists, which implies that all sublists with the maximum length should be returned. However, the program only returns the first sublist it encounters with the maximum length.

For example, if the input list is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11]]`, the program will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return all sublists with the maximum length, which are `[[1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11]]`.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case when the input list is empty, as it will throw an error. The problem description does not specify what should happen in this case, but the program's behavior is not consistent with the description.

To fix this, the program should return all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one, and handle the case when the input list is empty. The corrected program could be:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    if not list_of_lists:
        return None  # or any other value to indicate an empty list
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_len, max_sublists
```
