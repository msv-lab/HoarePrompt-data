Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the "list of maximum length in a list of lists," which implies that if there are multiple lists with the maximum length, all of them should be returned. However, the given program only returns one of the sublists with the maximum length. 

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`, the program will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, whereas the expected output should be `(3, [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])` because both `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` have the maximum length.

The correct program should return all sublists with the maximum length. The given program can be corrected to achieve this by returning `max_len` and `max_sublists` (without indexing) instead of `max_len` and `max_sublists[0]`. 

Corrected code:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```
