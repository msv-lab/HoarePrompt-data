The code calculates the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists` and assigns it to `max_len`. 

`max_len` is assigned the value of the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`. The value of `max_len` can be calculated as `max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)`. The state of `list_of_lists` is not affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_len` is equal to `max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)`**
