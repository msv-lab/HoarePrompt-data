According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 3 lists, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `list_of_lists` must have at least 3 lists and `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`. The values of `max_len` and `max_list` may have been updated in the previous iteration, but their exact values are not relevant to whether the loop executes again. 
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` and `max_list` remain as they were after the previous iteration**
