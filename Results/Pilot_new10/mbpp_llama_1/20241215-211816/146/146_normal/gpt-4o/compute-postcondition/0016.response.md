To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. The code `return max_len, max_list` indicates that the program will return two values: `max_len` and `max_list`.

Given the initial state:
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists.
- `max_len` is the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists`.
- `max_list` is the longest list in `list_of_lists`.
- If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_len` is 0 and `max_list` is an empty list.

The impact of the code on the program is that it returns the length of the longest list (`max_len`) and the longest list itself (`max_list`) from the `list_of_lists`. 

Considering the previous values of the affected variables:
- `max_len` will be the length of the longest list found in `list_of_lists`, or 0 if `list_of_lists` is empty.
- `max_list` will be the actual longest list found in `list_of_lists`, or an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty.

Therefore, the program returns `max_len` and `max_list`, where `max_len` is the length of `max_list`, and `max_list` is the longest list in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists` and the longest list itself. If `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns 0 and an empty list.**
