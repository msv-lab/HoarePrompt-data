The code updates the value of `max_list` to be equal to `lst`. The states of the other variables are not affected. `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_len` is the length of `lst`. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`**
