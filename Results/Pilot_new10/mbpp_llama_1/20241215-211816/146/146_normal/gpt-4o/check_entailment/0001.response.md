Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. It iterates through each list in the list of lists, checks if the length of the current list is greater than the maximum length found so far, and if it is, updates the maximum length and the corresponding list. 

The function handles the following cases correctly:

- Empty lists of lists: Although not explicitly tested in the provided unit tests, the function would return (0, []) for an empty list of lists, which is the expected behavior.
- Lists of lists with a single element: The function correctly handles this case and returns the length and the list itself.
- Lists of lists with multiple elements: The function correctly finds the list with the maximum length and returns its length and the list itself.
- Lists of lists with multiple lists of the same maximum length: Although not explicitly tested in the provided unit tests, the function would return the length and the first list it encounters with the maximum length, which is a valid behavior.

Overall, the program seems to handle all possible cases correctly and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
