Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `list_of_lists` as input.
2. It initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list. This is the default state in case the input list is empty.
3. It then iterates over each list `lst` in `list_of_lists`.
4. For each list, it checks if the length of the current list `lst` is greater than the current `max_len`.
5. If it is, it updates `max_len` to the length of the current list and sets `max_list` to the current list.
6. After iterating over all lists, it returns a tuple containing the `max_len` and the `max_list`.

The program meets the requirements of the problem description:

* It returns the length of the maximum length list and the first occurrence of the maximum length list.
* If there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, it returns the first one it encounters.
* If the input list is empty, it returns 0 and an empty list.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for different test cases. 

However, it's worth noting that the function could be improved by handling the case where the input list is empty. Currently, it will throw an exception if the input list is empty because it initializes `max_list` to an empty list, but then tries to return `max_len` and `max_list`. To fix this, you could add a check at the beginning of the function to return immediately if the input list is empty.

The function could be further improved by using the built-in `max` function with a custom key function to find the longest list in the list of lists. Here's how you could do it:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    if not list_of_lists:
        return 0, []
    max_list = max(list_of_lists, key=len)
    return len(max_list), max_list
```

This version of the function is more concise and easier to read, and it handles the case where the input list is empty correctly.
