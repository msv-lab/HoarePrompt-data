You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == (3, [13, 15, 17])
assert func_1([[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]) == (4, [10, 12, 14, 15])
assert func_1([[5], [15, 20, 25]]) == (3, [15, 20, 25])

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
    return (max_len, max_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. It iterates through each list in the list of lists, checks if the length of the current list is greater than the maximum length found so far, and if it is, updates the maximum length and the corresponding list. 

The function handles the following cases correctly:

- Empty lists of lists: Although not explicitly tested in the provided unit tests, the function would return (0, []) for an empty list of lists, which is the expected behavior.
- Lists of lists with a single element: The function correctly handles this case and returns the length and the list itself.
- Lists of lists with multiple elements: The function correctly finds the list with the maximum length and returns its length and the list itself.
- Lists of lists with multiple lists of the same maximum length: Although not explicitly tested in the provided unit tests, the function would return the length and the first list it encounters with the maximum length, which is a valid behavior.

Overall, the program seems to handle all possible cases correctly and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists and returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the first occurrence of the longest list. If the input list is empty, it returns 0 and an empty list. In cases where multiple lists have the same maximum length, it returns the length and the first list it encounters with that maximum length.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
