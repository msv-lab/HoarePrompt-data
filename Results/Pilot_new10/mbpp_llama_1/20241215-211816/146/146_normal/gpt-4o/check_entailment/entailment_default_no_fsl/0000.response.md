Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It iterates through each list in the input list of lists, keeping track of the maximum length and the first list that has this maximum length. 

The function `func_1` handles all potential cases as follows:
- If the input list is empty, it will return `(0, [])` because `max_len` is initialized to 0 and `max_list` is initialized to an empty list, and no list in the input (since there are none) will cause these values to be updated.
- If there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, it will return the length and the first list it encounters with that maximum length because it updates `max_len` and `max_list` as soon as it finds a list longer than the current `max_len`, but does not update them if a list has the same length as `max_len`.
- For all other cases, it correctly finds and returns the length and the first occurrence of the longest list in the input list of lists.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function in these scenarios, and there are no obvious edge cases that the function does not handle correctly.
