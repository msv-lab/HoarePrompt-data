#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing at least one list.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_len` is the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the longest list in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_len` is 0 and `max_list` is an empty list.
    return max_len, max_list
    #The program returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists` and the longest list itself. If `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns 0 and an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists and returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the first occurrence of the longest list. If the input list is empty, it returns 0 and an empty list. In cases where multiple lists have the same maximum length, it returns the length and the first list it encounters with that maximum length.
