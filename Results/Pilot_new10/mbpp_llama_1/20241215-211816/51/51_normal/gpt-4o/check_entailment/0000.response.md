Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in a list and divides the result by the length of the list. 

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

* It initializes a variable `product` to 1, which is the multiplicative identity. This ensures that the product of all numbers in the list is calculated correctly.
* It then iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`, multiplying the current product by the current number. This effectively calculates the product of all numbers in the list.
* After calculating the product, it divides the result by the length of the list using `len(numbers)`. This correctly implements the division by the length of the list as specified in the problem description.
* The function returns the final result, which is the product of all numbers in the list divided by the length of the list.
* The provided unit tests using `math.isclose` also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

Since the function correctly implements the required operation and passes all provided unit tests, it can be concluded that the function is correct for all potential cases.
