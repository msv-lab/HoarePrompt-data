To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the output states after the first few iterations.

The loop code multiplies the `product` variable by each number in the `numbers` list. After the first iteration, `product` is equal to the first number in the list. After the second iteration, `product` is equal to the product of the first two numbers. This pattern continues, indicating that `product` will accumulate the product of all numbers in the list as the loop iterates.

Given that the initial state specifies `numbers` is a non-empty list, the loop will execute at least once. The output states provided confirm this, showing that `numbers` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations.

After all iterations have finished, `num` will be the last number in the `numbers` list because it is updated in each iteration to the current number being processed.

The `product` variable will contain the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list. If the list is empty (which contradicts the given initial state but is a theoretical consideration for understanding the loop's behavior), the loop would not execute, and `product` would remain 1, which is the multiplicative identity and thus correct for an empty list.

Therefore, considering the loop code and the patterns observed from the output states after a few iterations, the output state after all iterations have finished is:

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers, `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the last number in the `numbers` list.**
