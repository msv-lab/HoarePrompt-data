The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input list is empty. However, the output hints provided mention that the function accepts a non-empty list of numbers. This implies that the input is assumed to be valid and will not be empty.

Given this information, the original assessment is not accurate. The program is designed to work with non-empty lists, and it correctly calculates the product of all numbers in the list and divides by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the program behaves as expected for valid inputs.

The original assessment is based on the assumption that the program should handle empty lists, but this is not a requirement according to the output hints. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided output hints.

Final: **True**
