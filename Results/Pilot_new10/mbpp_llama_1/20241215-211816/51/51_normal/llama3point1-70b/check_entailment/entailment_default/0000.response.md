Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates the product of all numbers in the input list and returns the result divided by the count of numbers. This is exactly as described in the problem description. The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function calculates the product of all numbers and returns the result divided by the count of numbers, which is not equivalent to the average of the numbers in the list. 

This function correctly handles all potential cases. For example, it correctly calculates the result for lists of different lengths and with different numbers, including lists containing zeros and negative numbers. It also correctly handles the case where the list contains only one number, returning the number itself as the product divided by the length is the number itself.

It's worth noting that the function does not check for empty input lists, which could lead to a ZeroDivisionError. However, based on the problem description and output hints, it is assumed that the input list is non-empty. If the problem description explicitly stated that the function should handle empty lists, then the correctness would be **False**. But in this case, the code does what the problem description says for every potential non-empty list.
