You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (either integers or floats), and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of numbers, `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the last number in the `numbers` list.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average of all numbers in the list, which is calculated as the product of all numbers divided by the total count of numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers, calculates the product of all numbers in the list, and returns the result divided by the count of numbers, which is not equivalent to the average of the numbers in the list
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
