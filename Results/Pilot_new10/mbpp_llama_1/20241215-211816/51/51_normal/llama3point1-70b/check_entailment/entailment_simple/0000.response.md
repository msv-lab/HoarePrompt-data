Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and then divides by the length of the list. The provided function `func_1` does exactly this:

1. It initializes a variable `product` to 1, which will be used to store the product of all numbers in the list.
2. It then iterates over each number in the list, multiplying the current `product` by the current number.
3. After the loop, `product` contains the product of all numbers in the list.
4. Finally, it returns the result of dividing `product` by the length of the list, effectively calculating the "product average" as specified in the problem description.

This function will work correctly for any non-empty list of numbers, whether they are integers or floats, because it correctly follows the mathematical operations specified in the problem description. Note that the problem description is somewhat unusual in asking for the product of all numbers divided by the count of numbers, rather than the sum of all numbers divided by the count (which would be the traditional definition of an average). However, the function correctly implements the specified calculation. 

One potential issue is if the list contains a zero, the product will be zero and the result will always be zero, regardless of the other numbers in the list. But this is still mathematically correct according to the problem description. 

In general, the function correctly handles all potential cases that are not explicitly excluded by the problem description (like an empty list, or a list containing non-numeric values).
