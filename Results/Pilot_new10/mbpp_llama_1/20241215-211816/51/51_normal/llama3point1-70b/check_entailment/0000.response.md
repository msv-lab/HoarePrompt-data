Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If an empty list is passed to the function, it will raise a ZeroDivisionError when trying to divide by the length of the list, which is zero. 

For example, if the input is `func_1([])`, the program will raise an error. According to the problem description, the function should multiply all the numbers in a list and divide by the length of the list, but it does not specify what to do when the list is empty. However, a common mathematical convention is that the product of an empty set of numbers is 1, and dividing by the length of an empty list (which is zero) is undefined. The program should ideally handle this case by raising a meaningful error or returning a specific value to indicate that the operation is undefined. 

In this case, the program does not work as expected for an empty list, so its correctness is **False**.
