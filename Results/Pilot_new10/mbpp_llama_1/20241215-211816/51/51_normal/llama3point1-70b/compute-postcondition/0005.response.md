According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 3 numbers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has at least 2 numbers, `num` is the second number in the list, and `product` is the product of the first two numbers. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 numbers, and `num` must be the third number in the list. 
State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 3 numbers, `product` is equal to the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the third number in the `numbers` list**
