The code `product *= num` updates the value of `product` by multiplying it with `num`. Initially, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, and `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list.

So, after executing the code, `product` will be equal to the product of the first number and the second number in the `numbers` list.

The state of `numbers` remains unchanged as it is a list of numbers with at least 2 numbers. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 2 numbers, `product` is equal to the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 2 numbers, `product` is equal to the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list**
