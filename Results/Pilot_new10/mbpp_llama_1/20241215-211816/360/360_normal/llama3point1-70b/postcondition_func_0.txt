The function accepts a non-empty list of lists of numbers and returns a sublist with the maximum sum of its numbers. If the input list is empty, it raises a ValueError. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists of numbers or where the sublists contain non-numeric values.
