The original assessment is "None", which implies that no evaluation was made regarding the program's correctness. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function appears to correctly return the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

The annotated code confirms that the function is designed to accept a non-empty list of lists of numbers and returns a sublist with the maximum sum of its numbers. Although the annotated code mentions that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists of numbers or where the sublists contain non-numeric values, this does not affect the correctness of the program given the assumption that the input will always be valid.

The function uses the built-in `max` function with the `key` parameter set to `sum`, which effectively finds the sublist with the maximum sum. This aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment being "None" does not provide any information about the correctness of the program, but based on the provided code and annotations, it seems the program is correct for the given problem description, assuming valid inputs.

Final: **True**
