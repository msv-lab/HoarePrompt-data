The original assessment states that the program is correct, and after analyzing the problem description, the code, and the annotated version, I agree with this assessment. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the list whose sum of elements is the highest. The `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum` is used to achieve this, which is a correct and efficient approach.

The annotated version of the code confirms this, stating that the function returns a sublist from the input list of lists that has the maximum sum of its numbers. The annotation also mentions that the function raises a `ValueError` if the input list is empty and returns one of the sublists if there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum.

The only potential issue mentioned in the annotated version is that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists of numbers or where the sublists contain non-numeric values. However, as stated in the problem description, we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

In conclusion, based on the problem description and the provided code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the described functionality, and no counterexamples can be found.

Final: **True**
