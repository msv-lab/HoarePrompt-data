The original assessment is "None", which implies that no initial judgment was made on the program's correctness. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` indeed returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. 

However, the output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists of numbers or where the sublists contain non-numeric values. But since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

The issue lies in the fact that the output hints state that if the input list is empty, it raises a ValueError, but the provided code does not explicitly handle this case. In Python, if the input list is empty, the `max()` function will raise a ValueError. So, in this regard, the code is correct but the hint about raising a ValueError for an empty list is already covered by Python's built-in behavior, and it is not something the function explicitly does.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` is correct in terms of finding the sublist with the maximum sum. Therefore, considering the constraints of valid input, the final assessment is:

Final: **True**
