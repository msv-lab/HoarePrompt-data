You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the list whose sum of elements is the highest. The `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum` is used to achieve this. This approach is correct and efficient.

Here's why the code is correct:

* The `max` function will iterate over all sublists in the input list of lists.
* For each sublist, the `sum` function calculates the sum of its elements.
* The `max` function then returns the sublist with the maximum sum.

This approach handles all potential cases correctly:

* If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, `max` will return one of them, which is a valid result.
* If the input list of lists is empty, `max` will raise a `ValueError`, which is an expected behavior.
* If a sublist contains non-numeric elements, `sum` will raise a `TypeError`, which is an expected behavior.

Overall, the code correctly implements the described functionality, and no counterexamples can be found.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty list of lists of numbers and returns a sublist with the maximum sum of its numbers. If the input list is empty, it raises a ValueError. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists of numbers or where the sublists contain non-numeric values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
