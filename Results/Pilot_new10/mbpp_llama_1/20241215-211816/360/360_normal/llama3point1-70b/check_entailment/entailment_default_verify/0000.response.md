Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements, which meets the problem description.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a sublist with the maximum sum of its numbers, raising a `ValueError` for an empty input list, and returning one of the sublists with the same maximum sum if there are multiple. 

The original assessment correctly notes that the function works correctly for all potential cases, including when there is only one sublist, multiple sublists with the same highest sum, and an empty input list. 

Although the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists of numbers or where the sublists contain non-numeric values, the problem description does not specify what to do in these cases. The output hints explicitly state that the function does not handle these cases, but this does not contradict the problem description.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
