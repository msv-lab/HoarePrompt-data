To assess the correctness of the provided program, we need to consider the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks for a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. 

The original assessment is "None," which does not provide any information regarding the correctness of the program.

The annotated version of the code indicates that the function `func_1` takes a list of lists of numbers as input and returns a sublist with the maximum sum of its numbers.

Based on the problem description and the annotated code, the program seems to correctly implement the required functionality. The `max` function with the `key=sum` argument is a suitable approach to find the sublist with the highest sum of elements.

The annotated code provides a clear explanation of the program's state and behavior, which aligns with the problem description. There are no apparent issues or discrepancies that would suggest the program is incorrect.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the annotated code, and the fact that we assume the input will always be valid, we conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
