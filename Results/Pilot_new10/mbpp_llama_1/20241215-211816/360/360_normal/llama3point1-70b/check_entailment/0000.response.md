Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The `max` function in Python is used with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which calculates the sum of each sublist and returns the sublist with the maximum sum.

This function works correctly for all potential cases:

- If there is only one sublist, it will be returned as it has the highest sum.
- If there are multiple sublists with the same highest sum, this function will return one of them, which meets the problem description as it does not specify what to do in this case.
- If the input list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`, which can be considered as correct behavior as the problem description does not specify what to do in this case.

The function is concise and efficient, as it uses the built-in `max` function and only calculates the sum of each sublist once.

Overall, the function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
