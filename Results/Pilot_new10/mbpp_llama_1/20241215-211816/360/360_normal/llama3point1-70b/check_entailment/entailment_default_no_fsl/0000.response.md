Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully align with the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it does not handle the case where the input list is empty, as it should raise a ValueError in such a scenario. Instead, the `max()` function will raise a ValueError with a message indicating that it is an empty sequence, but it does not explicitly check for this condition and provide a meaningful error message.

Another case where the code does not match the problem description is when the input is not a list of lists of numbers or when the sublists contain non-numeric values. The code assumes that the input will always be a list of lists of numbers, but the problem description does not guarantee this. If the input contains non-numeric values, the `sum()` function will raise a TypeError.

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, '6']]`, the `sum()` function will raise a TypeError when trying to sum the second sublist.

To make the code correct, it should include error checking to handle these potential cases. Here is an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func_1(lists):
    if not isinstance(lists, list) or not lists:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-empty list of lists")
    for sublist in lists:
        if not isinstance(sublist, list) or not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in sublist):
            raise ValueError("Input must be a list of lists of numbers")
    return max(lists, key=sum)
```
