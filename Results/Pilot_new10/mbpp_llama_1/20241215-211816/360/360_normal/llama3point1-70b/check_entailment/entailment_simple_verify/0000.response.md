To assess the correctness of the program, we must consider the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description requires a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. 

The original assessment correctly points out that the given function `func_1` meets the problem description by using the `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which returns the sublist with the maximum sum of elements. It also handles cases where there might be multiple sublists with the same highest sum by returning one of them and notes that an empty input list would raise a `ValueError`, which could be considered correct behavior given the problem description does not specify what to do in such cases.

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment by indicating that the function returns a sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its numbers, aligning with the problem description.

Given that the original assessment thoroughly covers the potential cases and the annotated version aligns with the expected functionality, there's no indication that the original assessment was inaccurate. The assumptions about valid input (non-empty list of lists containing numbers) are also acceptable given the context of the task, which focuses on the functional correctness of the code under expected conditions.

Final: **True**
