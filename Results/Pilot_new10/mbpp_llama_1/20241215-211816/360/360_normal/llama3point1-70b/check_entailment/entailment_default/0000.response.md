Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code provided does not handle the case where the input list is empty, as described in the problem description. According to the output hints, if the input list is empty, it raises a ValueError. However, the code does not explicitly include any error checking or handling for this case. In Python, if the input list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError when it tries to find the maximum value, but this is not explicitly handled by the code. 

For example, if we call the function with an empty list: `func_1([])`, it will raise a ValueError because `max()` function requires at least one element to compare. The code does not explicitly handle this case, and it does not raise a ValueError with a meaningful error message. Instead, it relies on the built-in behavior of the `max()` function.

Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists of numbers or where the sublists contain non-numeric values, as mentioned in the output hints. If the input list contains sublists with non-numeric values, the `sum()` function will raise a TypeError. 

To fix these issues, the code should include error checking and handling to ensure that it behaves correctly in all potential cases.
