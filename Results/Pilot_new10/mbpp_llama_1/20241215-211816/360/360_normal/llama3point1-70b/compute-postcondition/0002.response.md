The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists of numbers. The function uses the built-in `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum` to find the sublist with the maximum sum of its numbers. 

However, if the input list `lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `max` function cannot be applied to an empty sequence. 

Additionally, if there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the function will return one of them, but it is not specified which one. 

The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists of numbers, or where the sublists contain non-numeric values. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return a sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its numbers, if 'lists' is a non-empty list of lists of numbers, and to raise a `ValueError` if 'lists' is empty.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty list of lists of numbers and returns a sublist with the maximum sum of its numbers. If the input list is empty, it raises a ValueError. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists of numbers or where the sublists contain non-numeric values. **
