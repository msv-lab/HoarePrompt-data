The function accepts a list of lists containing numbers and returns the first inner list it encounters with the maximum sum of elements, handling empty inner lists and assuming all elements are numeric, with a potential TypeError if non-numeric elements are present, and returning an empty list if the input list of lists is empty or all inner lists are empty.
