To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the provided information and the loop code.

The loop iterates over each inner list in `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of the elements in the current inner list (`current_sum`), and checks if `current_sum` is greater than the current `max_sum`. If it is, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, and `max_list` is set to the current inner list (`sublist`).

Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

- `list_of_lists` must have at least as many inner lists as the number of times the loop has executed.
- `sublist` is the last inner list that was processed in the loop.
- `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the last inner list that was processed.
- `max_sum` is the maximum sum of elements found in any inner list processed so far.
- `max_list` is the inner list with the maximum sum found so far.

Considering the loop code and the observed patterns, after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- `list_of_lists` will still be the original list of lists, as the loop does not modify it.
- `sublist` will be the last inner list in `list_of_lists`, since the loop iterates over all inner lists.
- `current_sum` will be the sum of the elements in the last inner list, but this variable is local to the loop and not part of the output state in the context of the question.
- `max_sum` will be the maximum sum of elements found in any inner list in `list_of_lists`.
- `max_list` will be the inner list with the maximum sum of elements.

If the loop does not execute (which would be the case if `list_of_lists` were empty, contradicting the given initial state that `list_of_lists` is not empty), `max_sum` would remain negative infinity, and `max_list` would remain an empty list, as per the initial state.

However, given that `list_of_lists` is not empty, the loop will execute at least once. Thus, `max_sum` will be the maximum sum of the inner lists, and `max_list` will be the corresponding inner list with this maximum sum.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each inner list contains numbers, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of elements in any inner list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` is the inner list with the maximum sum of elements.**
