The given code assigns `current_sum` the value of the sum of the elements in `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the third inner list in `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` is already defined as the sum of the elements in the third inner list of `list_of_lists`, this code essentially reassigns `current_sum` to be the sum of the elements in `sublist`, which is the same as its initial value because `sublist` is the third inner list in `list_of_lists`. 

Therefore, the value of `current_sum` does not change, as it is being reassigned the same value it initially had. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 inner lists, `sublist` is the third inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the third inner list of `list_of_lists`**
