The code updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to `current_sum`. The previous value of `max_sum` was negative infinity, and the value of `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the first inner list of `list_of_lists`, which is greater than the previous value of `max_sum`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 inner list, `max_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in the first inner list of `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is an empty list, `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the first inner list of `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 inner list, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is an empty list, `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the first inner list of `list_of_lists`**
