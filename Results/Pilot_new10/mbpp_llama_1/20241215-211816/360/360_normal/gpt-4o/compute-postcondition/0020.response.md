The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numbers, and `list_of_lists` is not empty. After executing the function body, the function returns `max_list`, which is the inner list with the maximum sum of elements in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-empty list of lists containing numbers and return the inner list with the maximum sum of elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty list of lists containing numbers and returns the inner list with the maximum sum of elements.**
