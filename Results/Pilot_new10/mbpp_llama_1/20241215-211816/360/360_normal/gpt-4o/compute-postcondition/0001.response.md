The code initializes an empty list `max_list`. This operation does not affect the value of `list_of_lists` or `max_sum`. The value of `max_list` is now an empty list. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numbers, and `list_of_lists` is not empty; `max_sum` is negative infinity; `max_list` is an empty list**
