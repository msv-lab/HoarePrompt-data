The code assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. The value of `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the third inner list of `list_of_lists`, which is stored in `sublist`. Therefore, `max_sum` becomes equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 inner lists, `sublist` is the third inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the third inner list of `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is the sum of the elements in `sublist`.**
