The code snippet `max_list = sublist` assigns the value of `sublist` to `max_list`. Since `sublist` is the third inner list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` now holds a reference to this same inner list. The values of `list_of_lists`, `sublist`, `current_sum`, and `max_sum` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 inner lists, `sublist` is the third inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the third inner list of `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, and `max_list` is equal to `sublist`.**
