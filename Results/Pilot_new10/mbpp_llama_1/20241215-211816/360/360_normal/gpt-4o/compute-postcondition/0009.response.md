The given code is `current_sum = sum(sublist)`. 

In the Initial State, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the second inner list, `max_sum` is either the sum of the elements in the first inner list or remains unchanged, and `max_list` is either the first inner list or the second inner list.

Given that `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is updated to be the sum of the elements in `sublist`. 

So, `current_sum` now holds the sum of the elements in the second inner list of `list_of_lists`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` is either the sum of the elements in the first inner list or remains unchanged, `max_list` is either the first inner list or the second inner list depending on the values.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the second inner list of `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` is either the sum of the elements in the first inner list or remains unchanged, `max_list` is either the first inner list or the second inner list depending on the values**
