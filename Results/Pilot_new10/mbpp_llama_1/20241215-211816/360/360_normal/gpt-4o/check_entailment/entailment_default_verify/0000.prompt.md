You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program seems to be correct as it iterates through each sublist in the list of lists, calculates the sum of its elements, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum found so far. If it finds a sublist with a sum greater than the current maximum sum, it updates the maximum sum and stores the current sublist. 

Here are some potential cases that the program handles correctly:

1. **Multiple sublists with different sums**: The program will return the sublist with the highest sum.
2. **Single sublist**: The program will return the only sublist as it is the one with the highest sum by default.
3. **Empty list of lists**: Although this case is not handled explicitly, it will raise an error when trying to access the first sublist, which is acceptable since the problem statement does not specify what to do in this case.
4. **Sublists with equal maximum sums**: The program will return the first sublist it encounters with the maximum sum, which is a reasonable behavior since the problem statement does not specify what to do in this case.

The program's logic and implementation seem to align with the problem description, and no edge cases or potential inputs could be found that would cause the program to behave incorrectly. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists containing numbers and returns the first inner list it encounters with the maximum sum of elements, handling empty inner lists and assuming all elements are numeric, with a potential TypeError if non-numeric elements are present, and returning an empty list if the input list of lists is empty or all inner lists are empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
