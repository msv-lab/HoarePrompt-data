Correctness: **True**

The code provided does what the problem description says for every potential case. It iterates over the list of lists, calculates the sum of elements in each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum. The function returns the first sublist it encounters with the maximum sum, which meets the problem's requirements.

The code handles edge cases such as empty inner lists and non-numeric elements. Although it does not explicitly check for non-numeric elements, a TypeError will be raised if it encounters one. The function also returns an empty list if the input list of lists is empty or all inner lists are empty, as hinted in the output hints.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness in various scenarios, including:

1.  Lists with multiple sublists of varying lengths.
2.  Lists with sublists of the same length.
3.  Lists containing a single sublist.

The function's behavior aligns with the problem description and output hints, and no cases were found where it fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the code is correct.
