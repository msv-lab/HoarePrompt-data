Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the original assessment was "None", indicating no prior evaluation of the program's correctness.

Upon examining the code, the function `func_1` iterates through each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of elements in the current sublist, and updates `max_sum` and `max_list` whenever it encounters a sublist with a higher sum. After iterating through all sublists, it returns the sublist (`max_list`) with the maximum sum.

The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior, describing the state of the program before and after the loop execution. The annotations accurately reflect the logic of the function.

Given that the function correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests, and considering the problem description and the code's logic, it appears that the original assessment of "None" was due to a lack of prior evaluation rather than any inherent flaw in the assessment process.

The code seems to handle its intended task correctly, assuming valid input as specified (a non-empty list of lists containing only numbers). Thus, based on the information provided, the final correctness assessment of the program should affirm its correctness.

Final: **True**
