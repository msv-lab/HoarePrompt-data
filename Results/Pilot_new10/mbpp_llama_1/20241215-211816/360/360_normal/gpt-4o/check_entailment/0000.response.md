Correctness: **True**.

The provided program seems to be correct as it iterates through each sublist in the list of lists, calculates the sum of its elements, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum found so far. If it finds a sublist with a sum greater than the current maximum sum, it updates the maximum sum and stores the current sublist. 

Here are some potential cases that the program handles correctly:

1. **Multiple sublists with different sums**: The program will return the sublist with the highest sum.
2. **Single sublist**: The program will return the only sublist as it is the one with the highest sum by default.
3. **Empty list of lists**: Although this case is not handled explicitly, it will raise an error when trying to access the first sublist, which is acceptable since the problem statement does not specify what to do in this case.
4. **Sublists with equal maximum sums**: The program will return the first sublist it encounters with the maximum sum, which is a reasonable behavior since the problem statement does not specify what to do in this case.

The program's logic and implementation seem to align with the problem description, and no edge cases or potential inputs could be found that would cause the program to behave incorrectly. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
