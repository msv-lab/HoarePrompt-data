To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints.

The problem description asks for a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that iterates through each sublist in the list of lists, calculates the sum of elements in the current sublist, and checks if it's greater than the current maximum sum. If it is, the program updates the maximum sum and the corresponding sublist. This process ensures that the sublist with the highest sum of elements is returned.

The original assessment states that the program is correct, handling various cases, including sublists with different lengths, sublists with different element values, a list of lists containing only one sublist, and a list of lists containing multiple sublists with the same maximum sum.

The output hints summarize the code functionality, indicating that the function returns the first inner list it encounters with the maximum sum of elements, handling empty inner lists and assuming all elements are numeric.

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the sublist with the highest sum of elements and handles the specified cases. The output hints align with the program's behavior, confirming that it returns the first inner list with the maximum sum and handles empty inner lists.

The program assumes that the input is a list of lists containing numbers, which is a valid assumption given the problem description. The potential TypeError if non-numeric elements are present is not a concern, as the problem description does not specify handling non-numeric elements.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
