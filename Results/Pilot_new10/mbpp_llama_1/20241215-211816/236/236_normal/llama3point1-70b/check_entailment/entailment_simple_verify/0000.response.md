Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description asks to write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. The provided code uses the `sorted()` function to sort the list and then compares it with the original list. If the original list is already sorted, it will be equal to its sorted version, and the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

The annotated version of the code confirms this logic and provides additional context. It states that the input `nums` is a list of comparable elements, which implies that the list can be sorted. The annotation after the function call also confirms that the program returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and `False` otherwise.

The original assessment correctly identifies the correctness of the program by considering various edge cases, such as empty lists, single-element lists, lists with duplicate elements, lists with negative numbers or zero, and lists that are not sorted.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
