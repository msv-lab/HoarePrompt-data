To assess the correctness of the program, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. This implies the function should return `True` if the list is sorted (either in ascending or descending order, but typically ascending unless specified otherwise) and `False` otherwise.

2. **Original Program**:
   ```python
   def func_1(nums):
       return nums == sorted(nums)
   ```
   This function takes a list of elements (`nums`) and checks if it is equal to its sorted version. The `sorted()` function in Python sorts the elements in ascending order by default.

3. **Original Assessment**: None. Since there's no original assessment provided, we cannot compare or contrast it with our findings.

4. **Annotated Version**: The annotations state that the function returns `True` if the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order and `False` otherwise. This aligns with the general understanding of the `sorted()` function's behavior in Python, which sorts in ascending order by default.

Given the annotated version and the problem description, the function seems to correctly implement the requirement to check if a list is sorted in ascending order. The key points are:
- The function uses `sorted(nums)` as the basis for comparison, which is a straightforward and Pythonic way to check for sorted order.
- The function does not explicitly handle cases of descending order or other sorting orders, which is consistent with the typical interpretation of "sorted" as "sorted in ascending order" unless otherwise specified.
- The annotations clarify that the function may raise an exception if the list contains non-comparable elements or if sorting fails, which is a valid consideration, though it's more about the robustness of the function in handling edge cases rather than its correctness in terms of the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the program appears to correctly implement the functionality as described.

Final: **True**
