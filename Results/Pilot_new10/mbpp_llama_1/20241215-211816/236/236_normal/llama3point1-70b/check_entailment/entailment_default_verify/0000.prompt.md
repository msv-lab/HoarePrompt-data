You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it checks if the specified list is sorted or not by comparing it with its sorted version. The `sorted()` function in Python returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. If the original list is already sorted, then it will be equal to its sorted version, and the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

This approach works correctly for all possible cases, including:

- Empty lists: An empty list is considered sorted, and the function will return `True`.
- Single-element lists: A single-element list is considered sorted, and the function will return `True`.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The function will correctly handle lists with duplicate elements.
- Lists with negative numbers or zero: The function will correctly handle lists with negative numbers or zero.
- Lists that are not sorted: The function will correctly return `False` for lists that are not sorted.

Overall, the program is simple and effective, and it works correctly for all possible cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of comparable elements, returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, `False` otherwise, and may raise an exception if the list contains non-comparable elements or if sorting the list fails for any reason.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
