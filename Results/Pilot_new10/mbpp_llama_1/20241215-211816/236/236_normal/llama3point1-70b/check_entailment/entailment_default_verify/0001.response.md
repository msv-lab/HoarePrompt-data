The original assessment is "None", which implies that no initial evaluation of the program's correctness was provided. 

The problem description requires writing a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. The provided code defines a function `func_1(nums)` that returns `True` if the input list `nums` is equal to its sorted version, and `False` otherwise.

The output hints for `func_1` suggest that the function checks if the list is sorted in ascending order, which aligns with the problem description. However, they also mention that the function may raise an exception if the list contains non-comparable elements or if sorting the list fails for any reason. This behavior could be considered as part of the function's correctness, as it does not explicitly handle such edge cases but relies on Python's built-in sorting mechanism.

Given the output hints, the function seems to behave as expected for its intended purpose, checking if a list is sorted in ascending order. The function's simplicity and reliance on Python's built-in `sorted` function mean it does not explicitly handle all potential edge cases (like non-comparable elements), but it does fulfill the main requirement stated in the problem description under the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a list of comparable elements).

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided output hints, and considering that we assume the input will always be valid, the function is correct in the context of its specified task.

Final: **True**
