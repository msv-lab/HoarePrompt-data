Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of comparable elements as input and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise.

The line `return nums == sorted(nums)` checks if the input list `nums` is equal to its sorted version. If they are equal, it means the original list is already sorted, so the function returns `True`. If they are not equal, it means the original list is not sorted, so the function returns `False`.

This approach works for every potential case, including:

* Empty lists: `sorted([])` returns `[]`, so an empty list is considered sorted.
* Lists with one element: `sorted([x])` returns `[x]`, so a list with one element is considered sorted.
* Lists with multiple elements: `sorted([x, y, z])` returns a new list with the elements in ascending order. If the original list is already sorted, `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.
* Lists with duplicate elements: `sorted([x, x, y])` returns `[x, x, y]`, so a list with duplicate elements is considered sorted if the duplicates are in the correct order.
* Lists with negative numbers, floats, or strings: The `sorted` function works with any type of comparable elements, so the function will work correctly with these types of lists.

Overall, the program correctly determines whether a given list is sorted or not, and it does so for every potential case.
