You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the problem description. It checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by comparing the original list with a sorted version of itself. The `sorted()` function returns a new list containing all items from the original list in ascending order. If the two lists are equal, it means the original list was already sorted.

The program works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: An empty list is considered sorted, and the program correctly returns `True`.
- Lists with a single element: A list with a single element is considered sorted, and the program correctly returns `True`.
- Already sorted lists: The program correctly returns `True` for lists that are already in ascending order.
- Unsorted lists: The program correctly returns `False` for lists that are not in ascending order.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The program correctly handles lists with duplicate elements.
- Lists with negative numbers: The program correctly handles lists with negative numbers.

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it is not handling. Therefore, it is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of comparable elements (e.g., integers, floats, strings).
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns True if the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order, False otherwise.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
