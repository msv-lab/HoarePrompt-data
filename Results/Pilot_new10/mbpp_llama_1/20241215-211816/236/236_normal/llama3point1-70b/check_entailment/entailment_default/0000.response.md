Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by comparing the input list `nums` with its sorted version. The function `func_1` returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and `False` otherwise. 

The code works correctly for every potential case as it leverages the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which can handle lists of comparable elements, including integers, floats, and strings. The output hints also agree with the code, indicating that it returns `True` for sorted lists and `False` for unsorted lists, and may raise an exception if the list contains non-comparable elements.

The code correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with duplicate elements. It also works correctly for lists in descending order, as the `sorted` function sorts the list in ascending order by default.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `True` because the list is sorted in ascending order. If the input list is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, the function will return `False` because the list is not sorted in ascending order.

Overall, the code is correct and works as expected for every potential case.
