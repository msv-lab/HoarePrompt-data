To assess the correctness of the program, we need to evaluate whether the function `func_1` accurately determines if a specified list is sorted or not, based on the problem description and the provided output hints.

The problem description is to write a function that checks whether a specified list is sorted or not.

The function provided is:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
```
This function works by comparing the input list `nums` with its sorted version. If they are equal, it means the original list is sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The original assessment is `None`, indicating there's no prior evaluation of the function's correctness.

The output hints state that the function accepts a list of comparable elements and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, `False` otherwise. It may raise an exception if the list contains non-comparable elements or if sorting the list fails for any reason.

Given the function's implementation and the output hints, the function seems to align with the expected behavior for checking if a list is sorted in ascending order, considering the output hints imply the function works as intended for lists of comparable elements and provides the correct output for sorted and unsorted lists.

However, it's worth noting that the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input list contains non-comparable elements, as hinted by the output hints. But since the problem statement and the output hints assume valid input (lists of comparable elements), and given that the function correctly checks for sorted order in such cases, it can be considered correct under these assumptions.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, and assuming that the input will always be valid (a list of comparable elements), the program correctly checks if a list is sorted.

Final: **True**
