The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements, such as integers, floats, or strings. It then checks if the list is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version.

Upon analyzing the code, we notice that the function does not handle any potential edge cases related to the input list, such as an empty list, a list with a single element, or a list containing non-comparable elements (e.g., a mix of integers and strings). However, Python's built-in `sorted` function and comparison operators can handle these cases.

For an empty list, the function will return `True` since an empty list is considered sorted. For a list with a single element, the function will also return `True` because a list with one element is always sorted. If the list contains non-comparable elements, the function will raise a `TypeError` when trying to sort or compare the list.

Given the code and considering these edge cases, the functionality of the function is to check if the input list is sorted in ascending order and return `True` if it is, `False` otherwise. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where the input list contains non-comparable elements or where the sorting operation itself might fail due to other reasons (e.g., extremely large lists causing memory issues).

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of comparable elements, returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, `False` otherwise, and may raise an exception if the list contains non-comparable elements or if sorting the list fails for any reason. **
