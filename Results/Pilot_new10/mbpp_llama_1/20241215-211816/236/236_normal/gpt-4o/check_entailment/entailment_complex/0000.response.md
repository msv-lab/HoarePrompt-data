Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description, which asks to write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order or not.
2. The function iterates through the list using a for loop, comparing each element with its adjacent element.
3. If it finds a pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second element, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
4. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If the list has fewer than two elements, the function returns `True`, as the list is considered sorted (since there are no pairs of elements to compare).
* If the list contains non-comparable elements (e.g., a mix of integers and strings), the function may raise a `TypeError` when trying to compare them. However, this is not explicitly mentioned as a requirement in the problem description, and the function's behavior is not incorrect in this case.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness:

* `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True` because the list is sorted in ascending order.
* `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False` because the list is not sorted (20 is greater than 17).
* `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False` because the list is not sorted (15 is greater than 14).

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
