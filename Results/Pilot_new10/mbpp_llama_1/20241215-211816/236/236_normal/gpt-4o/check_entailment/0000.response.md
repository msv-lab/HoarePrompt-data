Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1`, checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by iterating through the list and comparing each element with its next element. If any element is greater than its next element, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the function iterates through the entire list without finding any such pair of elements, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The function handles all potential cases correctly. It correctly handles lists of different lengths and lists with duplicate elements. It also correctly handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element (although these cases are not explicitly tested in the provided assertions).

The provided assertions demonstrate the function's correctness. The first assertion checks a sorted list, and the function correctly returns `True`. The second and third assertions check unsorted lists, and the function correctly returns `False` in both cases.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It checks whether a specified list is sorted or not and returns the correct result for all potential cases.
