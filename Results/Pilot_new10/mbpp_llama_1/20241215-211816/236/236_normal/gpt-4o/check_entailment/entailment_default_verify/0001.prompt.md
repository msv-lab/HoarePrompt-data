You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It iterates over the list from the first element to the second last element, comparing each element with its next one. If any element is greater than its next one, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.

If the function completes the iteration without finding any unsorted pairs, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

This function correctly handles various cases, including:

- Sorted lists: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`
- Unsorted lists: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`
- Lists with duplicate elements (not included in the provided unit tests, but the function would still work correctly for such cases)
- Lists of varying lengths

The function does not explicitly handle edge cases like empty lists or lists with a single element. However, the function would still work correctly for these cases, as an empty list or a list with a single element is considered sorted.

For example, an empty list `[]` would cause the `for` loop to not execute, resulting in the function returning `True`, which is the correct result. A list with a single element `[5]` would also cause the function to return `True`, which is correct.

Overall, the provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not, and it handles various cases, including edge cases, correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of comparable elements and returns True if the list is sorted in ascending order or has fewer than two elements, and False otherwise. It does not handle lists with non-comparable elements, which may result in a TypeError.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
