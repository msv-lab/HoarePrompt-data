Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in ascending order or not.

Here's why:

1. The function iterates over the list using a for loop, comparing each element with its next adjacent element.
2. If it finds any pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
3. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

This approach ensures that the function meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly handles lists of various lengths, including empty lists and lists with a single element, as well as lists containing different data types that can be compared, such as integers, floats, or strings.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness:

- `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True` passes because the list is sorted in ascending order.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False` passes because the list is not sorted (20 is greater than 17).
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False` passes because the list is not sorted (15 is greater than 14).

In summary, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a list is sorted in ascending order, making it a correct solution to the given problem.
