To determine the final correctness of the program, let's evaluate the information provided step by step:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. This implies the function should return `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and `False` otherwise.

2. **Original Assessment**: None. There's no initial assessment to evaluate against.

3. **Program**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the list, comparing each element with the next one. If an element is greater than the next one, it immediately returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating the list is sorted.

4. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations provide clarity on the function's behavior and the conditions under which it returns `True` or `False`.
   - Specifically, the annotation after the loop states that if the loop completes normally, `i` will be `len(lst) - 2`, and the list is either sorted in ascending order or has fewer than two elements.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - The function appears to correctly implement the required logic for checking if a list is sorted in ascending order, based on the provided assertions and annotations.
   - The function handles lists with comparable elements correctly and behaves as expected for lists that are sorted, not sorted, or have fewer than two elements.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the problem description, the code, and the annotated explanations, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in ascending order.
   - The original assessment is "None," but if we had to make a judgment based on the provided information, the function's logic aligns with the requirements of the problem description.

**Final: True**
