Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by iterating through the list and comparing adjacent elements. If any pair of adjacent elements is in descending order, the function returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the function completes the iteration without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the function's behavior. The function does not handle lists with non-comparable elements, which may result in a TypeError, but this is not a requirement specified in the problem description.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness:
- The first test case passes a sorted list and the function returns `True`.
- The second test case passes a list with an out-of-order element and the function returns `False`.
- The third test case passes another list with an out-of-order element and the function returns `False`.

Overall, the code correctly implements the specified functionality, and there are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to behave incorrectly.
