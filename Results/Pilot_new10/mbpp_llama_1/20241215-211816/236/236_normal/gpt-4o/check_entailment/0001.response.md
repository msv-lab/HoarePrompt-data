Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It iterates over the list from the first element to the second last element, comparing each element with its next one. If any element is greater than its next one, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.

If the function completes the iteration without finding any unsorted pairs, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

This function correctly handles various cases, including:

- Sorted lists: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`
- Unsorted lists: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`
- Lists with duplicate elements (not included in the provided unit tests, but the function would still work correctly for such cases)
- Lists of varying lengths

The function does not explicitly handle edge cases like empty lists or lists with a single element. However, the function would still work correctly for these cases, as an empty list or a list with a single element is considered sorted.

For example, an empty list `[]` would cause the `for` loop to not execute, resulting in the function returning `True`, which is the correct result. A list with a single element `[5]` would also cause the function to return `True`, which is correct.

Overall, the provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not, and it handles various cases, including edge cases, correctly.
