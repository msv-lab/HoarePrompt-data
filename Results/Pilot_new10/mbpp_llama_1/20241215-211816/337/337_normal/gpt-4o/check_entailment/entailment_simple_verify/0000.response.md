The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it calculates the sum of unique elements, not the sum of non-repeated elements. This assessment is accurate because the problem description asks to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, which means elements that appear only once in the list. 

The provided function, `func_1`, uses the `set` function to remove duplicate elements and then sums them up. This approach is incorrect because it includes all unique elements, regardless of their frequency in the original list.

The annotated version of the code confirms this assessment, as it states that the program returns the sum of all unique integers in the list `lst`, which is not the same as returning the sum of non-repeated elements.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to count the frequency of each element and only include elements with a frequency of 1 in the sum, as shown in the correct implementation provided in the original assessment.

Final: **False**.
