Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, but the program calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list, which is not the same thing.

To illustrate this difference, consider a list where all elements are the same, e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 1]`. The sum of non-repeated elements in this list is `0`, because there are no non-repeated elements. However, the program will return `1`, which is the sum of all unique integers in the list.

Another example is the list `[2, 2, 3, 3]`. The sum of non-repeated elements in this list is `0`, because there are no non-repeated elements. However, the program will return `2 + 3 = 5`, which is the sum of all unique integers in the list.

To fix this, the program should count the occurrences of each integer in the list and only include integers that occur exactly once in the sum. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return sum(key for key, value in count_dict.items() if value == 1)
```
This implementation correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in the list, as required by the problem description.
