You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71
assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78

def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem asks to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, but the provided function calculates the sum of unique elements, which is not the same.

For example, consider the list [1, 2, 2, 3]. The sum of non-repeated elements is 1 + 3 = 4, but the function will return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. This is because the function treats all unique elements as non-repeated, whereas the problem statement asks for elements that appear only once in the list.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to count the frequency of each element and only include elements with a frequency of 1 in the sum. Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    count = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
        else:
            count[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, freq in count.items() if freq == 1)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71
assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
    #The program returns the sum of all unique integers in the list `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list, and returns this sum. If the list is empty, it returns 0. However, if the list contains non-integer values, it will throw an error, as it does not handle such cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
