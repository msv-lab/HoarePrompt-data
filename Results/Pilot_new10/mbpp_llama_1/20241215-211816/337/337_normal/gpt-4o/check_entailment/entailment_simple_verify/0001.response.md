The original assessment states that the provided Python program does not correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. This assessment is accurate based on the problem description.

The program uses the `set()` function to remove duplicates and then sums the resulting set. This approach sums all unique elements, not just the non-repeated ones. The annotated version of the code confirms this, stating that the program returns the sum of all unique integers in the list `lst`.

The problem description specifically asks for the sum of non-repeated elements, which means that only elements that appear exactly once in the list should be included in the sum. The provided program does not meet this requirement.

The original assessment provides a corrected version of the program that accurately calculates the sum of non-repeated elements by first counting the occurrences of each number and then summing the numbers that appear only once.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **False**
