The original assessment states that the provided Python program does not correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. This assessment is accurate based on the problem description. The program uses the `set()` function to remove duplicates and then sums the resulting set, which sums all unique elements, not just the non-repeated ones.

The output hints provided suggest that the function calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list, which aligns with the behavior of the provided code. However, the problem description specifically asks for the sum of non-repeated elements, not unique elements.

Given this information, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described because it sums all unique elements, not just those that appear exactly once.

Final: **False**
