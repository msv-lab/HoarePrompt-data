Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1` calculates the sum of unique integers in a list by converting the list to a set (which removes duplicates) and then summing the elements of the set. The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, as they compare the function's output with the expected sum of non-repeated elements in each test case. For example, in the first test case, the non-repeated elements are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the sum of these elements is indeed 20. However, the test case provided is `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21` the sum of unique elements is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21, this indeed matches the description as the repeated elements (1) are removed and the rest elements are summed. 

The output hints mention that the function will throw an error if the list contains non-integer values. However, this does not affect the correctness of the function for the specified problem description, which only mentions a "given list" without explicitly stating that the list can contain non-integer values. If the problem description were to include non-integer values, the function would indeed be incorrect for those cases. But as per the description of the task we should follow the problem description only.

Since the provided function works correctly for the given problem description, and the output hints agree with the code, we conclude that the correctness of the program is **True**.
