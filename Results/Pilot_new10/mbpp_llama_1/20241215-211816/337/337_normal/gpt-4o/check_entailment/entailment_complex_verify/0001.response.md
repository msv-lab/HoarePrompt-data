Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, it's clear that the original assessment was accurate. 

The problem description asks for the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the provided code calculates the sum of all unique elements in the list, not just the non-repeated ones. The annotated version confirms this, stating that the function returns the sum of all unique integers in the list.

The original assessment correctly points out this mistake and provides a corrected version of the function that accurately calculates the sum of non-repeated elements.

The reason why the original assessment is accurate is that the provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. The code sums all unique elements, which is not the same as summing only the non-repeated elements. 

Final: **False**
