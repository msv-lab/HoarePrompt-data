The original assessment is "None", indicating no prior judgment on the program's correctness. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the task is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The code defines a function `func_1` that uses the `set` function to get unique elements from the list and then sums them up using the `sum` function.

The output hints suggest that the function accepts a list of integers, calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list, and returns this sum. If the list is empty, it returns 0, but it does not handle cases with non-integer values, which could lead to errors.

However, upon closer inspection, the output hints and the code appear to align with the problem description in terms of calculating the sum of unique integers in the list. The code correctly implements this by converting the list to a set (which removes duplicates) and then summing the unique values.

One potential issue is the interpretation of "non-repeated elements." If the problem intended to ask for elements that appear only once in the list (not just unique elements), the given code does not correctly solve the stated problem because it sums all unique elements, regardless of their frequency in the list. 

Given the strict interpretation of the problem description ("sum of non-repeated elements") and common understanding in programming contexts, "non-repeated" often implies elements that appear exactly once. However, the code provided sums all unique elements, not necessarily those that appear only once.

Therefore, considering the typical interpretation of "non-repeated elements" as those that appear exactly once, the original assessment should be adjusted to reflect that the provided code does not accurately solve the problem as it stands.

The reason for changing the original assessment is the potential misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the term "non-repeated elements" in the context of the problem description and the functionality the code actually implements.

Final: **False**
