The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the provided code. The problem asks for the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, but the provided function calculates the sum of unique elements. This is not the same, as unique elements include all elements that appear at least once in the list, whereas non-repeated elements are those that appear exactly once.

The output hints also confirm this issue, as they state that the function calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list. This means that the function is not correctly implementing the problem description, as it should only include elements that appear exactly once in the sum.

The original assessment provides a correct example of why the function is incorrect, using the list [1, 2, 2, 3]. The sum of non-repeated elements in this list is 1 + 3 = 4, but the function will return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem, as it does not count the frequency of each element and only include elements with a frequency of 1 in the sum. The correct implementation, as provided in the original assessment, uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each element and then sums up the elements with a frequency of 1.

Final: **False**
