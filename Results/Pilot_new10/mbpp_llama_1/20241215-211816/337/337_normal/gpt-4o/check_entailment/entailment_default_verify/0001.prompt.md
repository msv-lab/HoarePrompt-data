You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71
assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78

def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The issue lies in the line where it uses the `set()` function to remove duplicates and then sums the resulting set. This approach sums all unique elements, not just the non-repeated ones.

For example, consider the list `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`. The sum of non-repeated elements here should be `2 + 4 = 6` because `1` and `3` are repeated. However, the given program will calculate the sum as `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program needs to count the occurrences of each element and only include elements that appear exactly once in the sum. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    counts = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in counts:
            counts[num] += 1
        else:
            counts[num] = 1
    return sum(key for key, value in counts.items() if value == 1)
```

This corrected version accurately calculates the sum of non-repeated elements by first counting the occurrences of each number and then summing the numbers that appear only once.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list, and returns this sum. If the list is empty, it returns 0. However, if the list contains non-integer values, it will throw an error, as it does not handle such cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
