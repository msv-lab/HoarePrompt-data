To determine the output state, let's consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Given the initial state: `lst` is a list of integers.

And the code snippet:
```python
return sum(set(lst))
```

This code does two main things:
1. It converts the list `lst` into a set. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. This means any duplicate integers in `lst` will be removed in the set.
2. It calculates the sum of all the unique integers in the set.

Therefore, the output of the program will be the sum of all unique integers in the list `lst`.

Output State: **The program returns the sum of all unique integers in the list `lst`.**
