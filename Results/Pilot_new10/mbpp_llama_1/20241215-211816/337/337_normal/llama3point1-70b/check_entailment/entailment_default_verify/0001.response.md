The original assessment is None, which means there is no prior evaluation of the program's correctness. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

The output hints suggest that the function works as intended for lists containing integers but may have issues with lists containing non-integer values or non-list inputs. However, since we are assuming that the input will always be valid (a list of integers), these potential issues do not affect the assessment of the program's correctness for its intended purpose.

The provided code uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over the list and sum up elements that appear only once. The condition `if lst.count(i) == 1` ensures that only non-repeated elements are included in the sum.

Given that the code accurately implements the required functionality based on the problem description and the assumption of valid input, the original assessment being None does not impact the evaluation. The output hints support the conclusion that the program is correct for its intended use case.

Final: **True**
