The original assessment was "None", which implies that no initial evaluation of the program's correctness was provided. 

Upon examining the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` appears to be correctly implemented. It iterates over the input list `lst` and sums up the elements that appear only once, as determined by the `count` method. The annotated version of the code also suggests that this is the intended behavior.

Therefore, based on the information available, I conclude that the program is correct. The reason for this conclusion is that the code accurately implements the function as described in the problem statement, and the annotations provide a clear explanation of the program's behavior.

Final: **True**
