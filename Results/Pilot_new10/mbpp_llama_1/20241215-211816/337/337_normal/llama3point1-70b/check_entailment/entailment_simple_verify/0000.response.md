Based on the problem description, the original assessment, the provided code, and the annotated version, I have evaluated the program's correctness.

The original assessment provided a thorough analysis of the program's logic, explaining how it handles unique elements, repeated elements, empty lists, and lists containing negative numbers or zero. The assessment concluded that the program is correct according to the provided problem description.

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment. It states that the program returns the sum of all integers in the list 'lst' that appear only once, which aligns with the problem description.

Considering all the information provided, I believe the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The logic is sound, and it handles various edge cases as expected.

The annotations in the code do not raise any concerns about the program's correctness. They accurately describe the state of the program and the expected output, which matches the problem description.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

Final: **True**
