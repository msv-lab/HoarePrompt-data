To assess the correctness of the provided Python function, we need to evaluate it against the problem description and the output hints. The problem description asks for a function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The function provided, `func_1`, uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to add up all elements `i` in the list `lst` that appear only once, as determined by `lst.count(i) == 1`.

The original assessment is "None," indicating there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness.

The output hints suggest that the function behaves as intended for lists containing integers, correctly summing unique integers, handling empty lists, and lists with duplicate or unique integers. However, it may raise errors if the input list contains non-integer values or if the input is not a list.

Given this information, let's evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the output hints.

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of all integers that appear only once in the list. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Input Validation**: The output hints mention potential issues with non-integer values or non-list inputs. However, the problem statement and the output hints imply that we should assume the input will always be a valid list of integers. Therefore, the lack of input validation for these specific cases does not necessarily make the function incorrect under the given assumptions.

3. **Efficiency**: The function uses `lst.count(i)` to check for uniqueness, which has a time complexity of O(n) for each element in the list, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n^2). While this could be optimized, the problem description does not specify efficiency requirements.

Considering these points, the output hints support the notion that the function behaves correctly for its intended purpose, assuming valid input. Therefore, since the function correctly sums non-repeated elements in a list of integers and handles the cases as described (with the assumption of valid input), the original assessment's lack of comment does not affect the program's correctness based on the given problem description and output hints.

Final: **True**
