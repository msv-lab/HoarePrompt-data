You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. This function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the count of that element in the list is equal to 1 using the `lst.count(i)` method. If an element appears only once, it is included in the sum.

The reason this function is correct is that it accurately implements the requirement as described. It correctly identifies elements that appear only once in the list (non-repeated elements) and sums them up. The logic is straightforward and handles all potential cases as expected:

1. **Handling Unique Elements:** If all elements in the list are unique, every element will be counted once, and the sum of the list will be returned, which is the expected behavior since all elements are non-repeated.
2. **Handling Repeated Elements:** If a list contains repeated elements, only elements that appear once will be included in the sum. Elements that appear more than once will be excluded.
3. **Handling Empty Lists:** If an empty list is provided, the function will return 0, as the sum of no elements is 0. This aligns with the expectation since there are no elements to sum.
4. **Handling Lists with Negative Numbers or Zero:** The function will correctly sum negative numbers and zero if they appear as non-repeated elements in the list.

Given the thoroughness of the function's logic and its ability to handle various edge cases, the conclusion is that the program is correct according to the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers in the list 'lst' that appear only once.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
