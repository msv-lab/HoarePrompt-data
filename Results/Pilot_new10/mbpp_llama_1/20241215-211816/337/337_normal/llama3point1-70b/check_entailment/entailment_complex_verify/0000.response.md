To evaluate the correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The original assessment concludes that the provided function `func_1` is correct because it accurately implements this requirement. It handles various cases, including lists with unique elements, repeated elements, empty lists, and lists containing negative numbers or zero.

The annotated version of the code explains the state of the program before the function call, the operation performed within the function, and an overview of what the function does, including potential error cases if the input list contains non-integer values or is not a list. However, the problem statement and the assessment context assume the input will always be a valid list of integers.

Given these considerations:

1. **Problem Statement Alignment**: The function `func_1` directly addresses the problem statement by summing elements that appear only once in the list.
2. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic within `func_1` is straightforward and accurate for the specified task. It uses `lst.count(i) == 1` to identify unique elements and sums them up.
3. **Assumed Input Validity**: Both the original assessment and the annotated code note that the function assumes a valid input (a list of integers). Given this assumption, the function behaves as expected.
4. **Robustness**: While the annotated code mentions potential issues with non-integer values or non-list inputs, these are excluded by the assumption of valid input.

Based on the analysis:

- The original assessment correctly evaluates the function's logic and handling of specified cases.
- The annotated version confirms the function's behavior and highlights the assumption of valid input, which is consistent with the problem statement and the assessment's context.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated code, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
