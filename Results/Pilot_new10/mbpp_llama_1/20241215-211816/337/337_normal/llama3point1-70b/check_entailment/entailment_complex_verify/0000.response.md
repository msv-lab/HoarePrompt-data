To assess the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let's break down the information given.

1. **Problem Description**: The program should find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. This means for each unique integer in the list that appears only once, it should be included in the sum.

2. **Original Assessment**: None. There's no initial assessment provided, so we have no baseline to compare against.

3. **Program**:
   ```python
   def func_1(lst):
       return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
   ```
   This program works by iterating through each element `i` in the list `lst` and using the `count` method to check if the element appears only once. If it does, `i` is included in the sum. This approach directly addresses the problem description by summing all non-repeated integers in the list.

4. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotation states that the function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of all integers that appear only once, handling empty lists and lists with duplicates or unique integers.
   - It also notes the function might raise errors if the input list contains non-integer values or is not a list.

Given this information:

- The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a list, assuming the input is a list of integers.
- The annotated version aligns with this assessment, providing a clear explanation of what the function does and under what conditions it might fail (though these failure conditions are outside the scope of the problem description).

**Conclusion**: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly implements the desired functionality. The original assessment being "None" doesn't influence our final judgment since we've directly evaluated the program's correctness against the problem description.

**Final: True**
