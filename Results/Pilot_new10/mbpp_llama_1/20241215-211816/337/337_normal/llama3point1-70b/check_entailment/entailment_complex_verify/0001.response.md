Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is "None", which implies that no initial assessment was made.

The annotated version of the code suggests that the function works as intended, which is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The annotation states that "The program returns the sum of all integers in the list 'lst' that appear only once," which aligns with the problem description.

However, the annotated version also mentions that the function "may raise errors if the input list contains non-integer values or is not a list," which is not considered an issue based on the problem description, as it is assumed that the input will be valid.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the original assessment of "None" is effectively nullified, and a new assessment can be made.

The function appears to correctly implement the required functionality, and the annotations support this conclusion.

Final: **True**
