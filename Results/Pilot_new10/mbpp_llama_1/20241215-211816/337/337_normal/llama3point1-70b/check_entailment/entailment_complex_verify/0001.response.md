The original assessment concludes that the program is correct based on the problem description, providing examples and logic that align with the requirement of summing non-repeated elements in a list. The annotated version of the code supports this logic, indicating that the function indeed calculates and returns the sum of integers that appear only once in the list. Both the original assessment and the annotated code description agree on the function's purpose and behavior for various cases, including empty lists, lists with all unique elements, lists with duplicate elements, and single-element lists.

The annotations provided also mention potential issues with the input, such as the list containing non-integer values or not being a list. However, the problem statement does not specify handling such invalid inputs, and it is mentioned that we should assume the input will be valid and not cause errors in the program.

Given this information, there is no evidence from the annotated version of the code or the problem description that contradicts the original assessment. The original assessment accurately describes the function's behavior and its alignment with the problem description, considering valid input as per the assumptions provided.

Final: **True**
