Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and uses a generator expression to iterate over each integer `i` in the list. It then checks if the count of `i` in the list is equal to 1 using the `count` method. If it is, `i` is a non-repeated element, and its value is included in the sum. The function handles cases where the list is empty (returning 0) or contains duplicate or unique integers. The output hints suggest that the function may raise errors if the input list contains non-integer values or is not a list, but this does not contradict the problem description, as it only asks for the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

For example, given the input `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, the function correctly returns `1 + 3 = 4`, which is the sum of the non-repeated elements in the list. Similarly, for an empty list `[]`, it returns `0`, which is the expected result.

The code does not seem to have any edge cases that it does not handle correctly, as it properly handles empty lists, lists with duplicates, and lists with unique elements. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
