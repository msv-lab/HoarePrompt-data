The original assessment is "None", which implies that there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. Given the problem description and the provided code, we can assess the program's correctness directly.

The problem description asks for a function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses a generator expression to iterate over the list `lst`, filtering out elements that appear more than once by using the condition `lst.count(i) == 1`. The `sum` function then adds up these unique elements.

The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior, stating that the program returns the sum of all integers in the list 'lst' that appear only once. This matches the problem description.

Therefore, based on the code and the annotations, it appears that the program is correct. The original assessment being "None" doesn't provide any conflicting information, but the analysis of the code itself leads to the conclusion that it accurately solves the described problem.

Final: **True**
