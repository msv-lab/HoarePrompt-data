The original assessment seems accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly sums up all non-repeated elements in the given list by utilizing a generator expression within the `sum` function, filtering elements based on their occurrence in the list, which is effectively done by `lst.count(i) == 1`.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by confirming the state of the program before the function call and the expected return value. The annotation that the program returns the sum of all integers in the list 'lst' that appear only once aligns with the logic implemented in the function and the problem's requirements.

Given the annotations and the original assessment, there's no evidence to suggest that the original assessment was inaccurate. The provided function handles various potential cases as described, including empty lists, lists with all unique elements, lists with duplicate elements, and single-element lists, all in accordance with the problem's description.

Thus, the original assessment of Correctness: **True** seems to be accurate based on the evidence and the annotations provided.

Final: **True**
