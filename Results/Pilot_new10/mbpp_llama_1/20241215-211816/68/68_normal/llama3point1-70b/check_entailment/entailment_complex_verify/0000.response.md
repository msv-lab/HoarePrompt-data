To assess the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to evaluate if the program successfully computes and returns the angle of a complex number as requested.

The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number. 

The original assessment is "None", indicating no initial judgment was made on the program's correctness.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It constructs a complex number from these parts and uses the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate and return the phase (angle) of this complex number in radians.

The annotated version explains the state of the program at different points, affirming that it accepts two real numbers, constructs a complex number from them, and returns its phase (angle) in radians. It also mentions proper handling of all possible cases, including when the real part is 0, which can be a critical case due to the potential for division by zero in manual calculations (though `cmath.phase()` handles this correctly).

Given this analysis:

1. The program aligns with the problem description by calculating the angle of a complex number.
2. The `cmath.phase()` function is used correctly to compute the angle, which is a built-in and reliable method for this purpose.
3. The annotations suggest the program handles all cases properly, including edge cases like a real part of 0, which is a consideration for robustness.

Therefore, based on the provided code and annotations, and considering the problem description, the program seems to be correct in its implementation for calculating the angle of a complex number.

Final: **True**
