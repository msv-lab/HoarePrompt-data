The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial assessment of the program's correctness. 

Based on the problem description, the program is supposed to write a function to get the angle of a complex number. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two real numbers `real` and `imag` as input, creates a complex number `complex_num` using these numbers, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number using the `cmath.phase` function.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program returns the phase (angle) of the complex number in radians, which is equal to the arctangent of `imag/real`. This is a correct implementation of the problem description.

Therefore, I believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations.

Final: **True**
