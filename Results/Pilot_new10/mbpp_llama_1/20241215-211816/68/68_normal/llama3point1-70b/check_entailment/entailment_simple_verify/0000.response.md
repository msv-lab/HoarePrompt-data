The problem description asks for a function to calculate the angle of a complex number. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input, constructs a complex number from these parts, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number in radians using the `cmath.phase` function.

The original assessment is "None", indicating that no initial assessment was made.

The annotated code provides additional information about the state of the program before the function call and the return value of the function. The annotation states that `real` and `imag` are real numbers, which is a valid assumption given the problem description.

Based on the annotated code, it appears that the function correctly calculates the angle of the complex number. The `cmath.phase` function returns the phase (angle) of the complex number in radians, which is the expected output.

Therefore, the original assessment of "None" does not provide any information to contradict or support the correctness of the program. However, based on the annotated code and the problem description, it seems that the program is correct.

The reason for this assessment is that the program correctly uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the angle of the complex number, and the annotations confirm that the input values are valid real numbers.

Final: **True**
