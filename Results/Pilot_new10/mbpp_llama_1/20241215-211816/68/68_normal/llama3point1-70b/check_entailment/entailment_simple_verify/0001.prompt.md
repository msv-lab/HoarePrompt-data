You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the angle (in radians) of a complex number correctly using the `cmath.phase()` function from Python's standard library. 

The `cmath.phase()` function returns the counterclockwise angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number. 

Here is an explanation of why this code is correct:

1. It correctly constructs a complex number using the provided real and imaginary parts.
2. The use of `cmath.phase()` ensures that the function accurately calculates the angle of the complex number in radians.
3. The function does not have any obvious edge cases that it fails to handle. For example, it can handle complex numbers with zero real or imaginary part, and it can handle negative values for the real or imaginary part.
4. The function also handles the case when the input complex number is zero (i.e., both real and imaginary parts are zero). In this case, `cmath.phase()` returns `0`, which could be considered as the angle in the positive x-axis direction.

Since all the examples and edge cases have been considered, the code appears to be correct. If there were any potential cases that the code did not handle correctly, it would be incorrect, but based on the provided code, it seems to work as expected according to the problem description. 

However, please note that potential issues might arise due to floating point precision errors in certain inputs, but such issues would be rare and depend on the specific inputs and the system being used. For all practical purposes, this function appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and code.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import cmath

#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are real numbers.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `complex_num` in radians, which is equal to the arctangent of `imag/real`, where `real` and `imag` are real numbers


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
