Correctness: **True**.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns its angle using the `cmath.phase` function. The `cmath.phase` function returns the phase (angle) of the given complex number, which matches the problem description.

This function works correctly for all possible complex numbers, including those with zero or negative real and imaginary parts, as well as those with very large or very small values. The `cmath.phase` function handles these edge cases correctly, returning the expected angle for each case.

For example, `func_1(3, 4)` returns `0.9272952180016122`, which is the correct angle for the complex number `3 + 4j`. Similarly, `func_1(-3, 4)` returns `2.214297435588181`, which is the correct angle for the complex number `-3 + 4j`.

Since the `cmath.phase` function is designed to work with all possible complex numbers and returns the correct angle in all cases, the `func_1` function is correct. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
