You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns its angle using the `cmath.phase` function. The `cmath.phase` function returns the phase (angle) of the given complex number, which matches the problem description.

This function works correctly for all possible complex numbers, including those with zero or negative real and imaginary parts, as well as those with very large or very small values. The `cmath.phase` function handles these edge cases correctly, returning the expected angle for each case.

For example, `func_1(3, 4)` returns `0.9272952180016122`, which is the correct angle for the complex number `3 + 4j`. Similarly, `func_1(-3, 4)` returns `2.214297435588181`, which is the correct angle for the complex number `-3 + 4j`.

Since the `cmath.phase` function is designed to work with all possible complex numbers and returns the correct angle in all cases, the `func_1` function is correct. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, creates a complex number from them, and returns its phase (angle) in radians, properly handling all possible cases, including those where `real` is 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
