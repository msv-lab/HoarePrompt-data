You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. The `cmath.phase()` function returns the counterclockwise angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the segment joining the origin to the complex number. The function takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are used to create a complex number.

The assertions provided in the code test the function with different complex numbers and verify that the returned angles are correct within a certain relative tolerance. 

The function works correctly for all potential cases. For example, it correctly handles complex numbers with zero real part (e.g., `0 + 1j`), complex numbers with zero imaginary part (e.g., `2 + 0j`), and complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts (e.g., `2 + 2j`).

In all cases, the `cmath.phase()` function returns the correct angle in radians, and the `func_1` function returns this angle without any modifications. Therefore, the program is correct, and the function works as expected according to the problem description. 

It's also worth noting that the function handles edge cases such as zero (which has an angle of 0), and negative numbers, as the `cmath.phase()` function returns the correct angles for these cases as well. 

So, after testing and analyzing the code, I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, forms a complex number from them, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number, handling all cases including the origin (0+0j) by convention.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
