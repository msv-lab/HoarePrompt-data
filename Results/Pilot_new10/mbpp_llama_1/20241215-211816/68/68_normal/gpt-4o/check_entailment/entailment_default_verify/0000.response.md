The problem description requires a function to calculate the angle of a complex number. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, forms a complex number from them, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase` function.

The original assessment is `None`, indicating that no initial evaluation was provided. However, based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, we can evaluate the correctness of the program.

The output hints suggest that the function correctly handles all cases, including the origin (0+0j), by convention. The `cmath.phase` function returns the phase (angle in radians) of a complex number, which aligns with the problem description.

Upon reviewing the code, we notice that it correctly forms a complex number from the `real` and `imag` inputs and returns the phase of this complex number. The `cmath.phase` function can handle the origin (0+0j) and returns a value of 0 by convention, which is a valid angle in radians.

Given the problem description, code, and output hints, the program appears to be correct. The `cmath.phase` function correctly calculates the phase of a complex number, and the code does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that are not handled.

Therefore, based on the available information, we conclude that the original assessment was not inaccurate due to lack of information, but the program itself is correct.

Final: **True**
