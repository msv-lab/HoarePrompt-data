You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. The `cmath.phase()` function returns the counterclockwise angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the segment joining the origin to the complex number. The function takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are used to create a complex number.

The assertions provided in the code test the function with different complex numbers and verify that the returned angles are correct within a certain relative tolerance. 

The function works correctly for all potential cases. For example, it correctly handles complex numbers with zero real part (e.g., `0 + 1j`), complex numbers with zero imaginary part (e.g., `2 + 0j`), and complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts (e.g., `2 + 2j`).

In all cases, the `cmath.phase()` function returns the correct angle in radians, and the `func_1` function returns this angle without any modifications. Therefore, the program is correct, and the function works as expected according to the problem description. 

It's also worth noting that the function handles edge cases such as zero (which has an angle of 0), and negative numbers, as the `cmath.phase()` function returns the correct angles for these cases as well. 

So, after testing and analyzing the code, I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are real numbers.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `real + imag`j


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
