The problem description requires writing a function to get the angle of a complex number. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a real and an imaginary part as input, constructs a complex number, and returns its phase (angle in radians) using the `cmath.phase` function.

The original assessment is "None", indicating no prior judgment on the program's correctness.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly constructs a complex number from the given real and imaginary parts and returns its phase. The assertions provided in the code test the function with different inputs and expected outputs, which aligns with the problem description.

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function appears to correctly calculate the angle of a complex number. The use of `cmath.phase` ensures that the angle is calculated in radians, which is a standard representation for angles in mathematics.

The annotated version does not reveal any issues or discrepancies that would suggest the original assessment (or lack thereof) was inaccurate. The function seems to be correctly implemented according to the problem description.

Therefore, considering all the information and the strict format requirement:

Final: **True**
