The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input, constructs a complex number using these parts, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase` function.

The original assessment is None, meaning there was no initial judgment made about the program's correctness.

The annotated version of the code explains the state of the program before and after the function call, which aligns with the expected behavior based on the problem description. It clarifies that the function expects real and imaginary parts as input and returns the angle of the resulting complex number in radians.

Given the problem description and the code provided, the function `func_1` appears to accurately implement the requested functionality. It correctly constructs a complex number from the given real and imaginary parts and returns its angle in radians. The assertions at the beginning of the code provide test cases that validate the function's behavior for different inputs.

Therefore, based on the information available, it seems that the program is correct according to the problem description. The original assessment being None implies a lack of information rather than an incorrect assessment. The annotated version supports the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
