The original assessment and the annotated version both suggest that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. The function takes two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, forms a complex number from them, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number.

The assertions provided in the code test the function with different complex numbers and verify that the returned angles are correct within a certain relative tolerance. The `cmath.phase()` function is a built-in Python function that returns the counterclockwise angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the segment joining the origin to the complex number.

The annotated version of the code provides additional information about the state of the program at different points. It confirms that the function accepts two real numbers, forms a complex number from them, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number.

Based on the information available, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The function correctly calculates the angle of a complex number, and the assertions provided in the code verify its correctness.

Final: **True**
