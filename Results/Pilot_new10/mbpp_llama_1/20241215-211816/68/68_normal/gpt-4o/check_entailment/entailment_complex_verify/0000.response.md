Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, it seems that the program is correctly implemented to calculate the angle of a complex number.

The original assessment is "None", which means there is no initial assessment to compare with. However, after reviewing the code and the annotations, I can confirm that the program is correct.

The function `func_1` takes two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, forms a complex number from them, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number.

The annotated version of the code provides additional context, stating that the function accepts two real numbers, forms a complex number from them, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number, handling all cases including the origin (0+0j) by convention. This annotation is consistent with the implementation of the `func_1` function.

The unit tests provided also suggest that the function is working correctly, as they check the function's output for different inputs and verify that the results are within a certain tolerance using `math.isclose`.

Therefore, based on the information available, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
