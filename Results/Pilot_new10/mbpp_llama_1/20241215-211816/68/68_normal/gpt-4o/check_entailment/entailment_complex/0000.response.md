Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number. The provided function, `func_1`, accepts two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, forms a complex number from them, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Correct Functionality**: The function uses the `cmath` module, which provides functions to handle complex numbers, and specifically the `phase` function to calculate the angle of the complex number.

2. **Handling Complex Number Formation**: The function correctly forms a complex number using the provided real and imaginary parts.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program also handles edge cases by convention, including the origin (0+0j), although the specific behavior in this case is not explicitly defined in the problem description. The `cmath.phase` function returns 0 for this case, which is a common convention.

4. **Return Type**: The function returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number, which matches the requirement in the problem description.

5. **Assertion Validation**: The provided assertions validate the functionality of the function for different inputs, including complex numbers with non-zero real and imaginary parts.

However, it is worth noting that the problem description does not explicitly define the behavior for the origin (0+0j). The `cmath.phase` function returns 0 for this case, which is a common convention, but the problem description should ideally specify this behavior to ensure correctness. 

In the absence of a specific requirement for the origin, and considering the common convention used by `cmath.phase`, the program meets the requirements in the problem description, making it correct.
