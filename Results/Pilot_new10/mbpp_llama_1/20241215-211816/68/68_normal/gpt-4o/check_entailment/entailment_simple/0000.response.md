Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to get the angle of a complex number. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.

2. It then creates a complex number using these two parts with the line `complex_number = complex(real, imag)`.

3. The `cmath.phase` function is used to calculate the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number.

4. The function returns this phase, which is the angle of the complex number.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)`, verify that the function behaves correctly for different inputs.

The `cmath.phase` function is part of the Python standard library and is specifically designed to calculate the phase of a complex number. This makes the implementation straightforward and reliable.

In summary, the program meets the requirements of the problem description by correctly calculating and returning the angle of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts.
