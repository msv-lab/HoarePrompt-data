To determine the functionality of the given function, let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are real numbers. It creates a complex number using these two parameters and then returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number.

Here is the breakdown:

1. The function accepts two real number parameters, `real` and `imag`.
2. It forms a complex number using these parameters (`complex_number = complex(real, imag)`).
3. The function then returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number using `cmath.phase(complex_number)`.

Given the code, the annotations seem to accurately describe what the function does. There are no obvious edge cases or missing logic in the provided code snippet that the annotations fail to cover. However, one should note that the `cmath.phase()` function returns the phase of the complex number in radians, which can range from -π to π.

The potential edge case to consider is when `real` is 0 and `imag` is 0, because the phase of the complex number 0+0j is not uniquely defined. In such cases, `cmath.phase(0+0j)` returns 0, which is a convention to handle this case.

Given the code's simplicity and the annotations provided, the functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, forms a complex number from them, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number, handling all cases including the origin (0+0j) by convention. **
