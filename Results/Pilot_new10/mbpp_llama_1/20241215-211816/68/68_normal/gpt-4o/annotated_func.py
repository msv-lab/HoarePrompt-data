#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are real numbers.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `real + imag`j
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, forms a complex number from them, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number, handling all cases including the origin (0+0j) by convention.
