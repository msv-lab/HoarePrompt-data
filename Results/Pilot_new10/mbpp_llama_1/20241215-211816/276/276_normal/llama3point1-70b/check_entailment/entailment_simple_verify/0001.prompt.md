You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly when the two input lists are of the same size, but the total size of the merged list is even. In this case, the median should be the average of the two middle numbers in the merged list, but the program calculates it incorrectly.

For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, the merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The size of each list is 2, so the total size is 4, which is even. The program calculates the median as `(merged_list[1] + merged_list[2]) / 2 = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, which is correct. However, if we change the lists to `list1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]` and `list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]`, the merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`. The size of each list is 4, so the total size is 8, which is even. The program calculates the median as `(merged_list[3] + merged_list[4]) / 2 = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5`, which is correct. But if we pass size = 4 to the function the program calculates the median as `(merged_list[3] + merged_list[4]) / 2 = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5` which is correct but it assumes that the total size is always the `2*size` and does not handle cases correctly when size of each list is different. So if size is not `2*size` the function will not work correctly. So the function does not work correctly when the size of the lists are not the same. 

However the description of the problem specifically says "Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size." so it handles cases where size of the input lists are same but there is a better way to solve it without passing the size as a parameter and the code could be simplified by using a loop to find middle index since the size of the lists are same. 

However there is a logical error if size is not `2*size`. For example if `size = 3`, `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [4, 5, 6]` then `merged_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. The program will calculate the median as `(merged_list[2] + merged_list[3]) / 2 = (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5` which is correct because the size of the `merged_list` is 6 which is even, but it should have taken middle_index = 2 if size = 3 was correct input. So this example will throw an error and the code will not work as expected.

The code should be modified to handle cases where the size of the input lists may not be known before. In that case the code can be simplified as:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    size = len(merged_list)
    middle_index = size // 2
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, size is a positive integer such that size == len(list1) and size == len(list2), and both list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, each with a length of `size`; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`; `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, the `median` is the average of the two middle elements `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`. If `size` is odd, the `median` is the middle element `merged_list[size]` however since `middle_index` is `size - 1`, it can be written as `merged_list[size - 1]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged list, which is either the average of the two middle elements if `size` is even, or the middle element if `size` is odd, from a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
