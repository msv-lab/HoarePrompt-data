Correctness: **False**

The code does not work correctly when the size is odd. The problem description asks for the median of two sorted lists of the same size, and when the total length of the merged list is odd, the median should be the middle element. However, in the given code, the middle index is calculated as `size - 1`, which is incorrect. It should be calculated as `(2 * size - 1) // 2` because the merged list has `2 * size` elements.

For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, the merged list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, but the code will return `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5` because it calculates the middle index incorrectly when the size is even. When the size is odd, the problem becomes worse, and the code will return the wrong middle element.

To fix this, the code should be modified to calculate the middle index correctly based on the total length of the merged list. The correct calculation for the middle index is `(2 * size - 1) // 2` for odd lengths and `2 * size // 2` for even lengths. 

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    total_size = 2 * size
    middle_index = total_size // 2
    if total_size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
