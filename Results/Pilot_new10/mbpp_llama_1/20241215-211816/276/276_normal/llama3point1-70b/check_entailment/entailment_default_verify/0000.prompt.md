You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program has a bug in the line where it calculates the `middle_index`. The correct calculation should be `size - 1` for the combined list, but since the combined list has twice the size of the input lists, the correct calculation should be `(2 * size) // 2` or simply `size`. However, this is not the main issue.

The main issue is that the function does not correctly calculate the median when the size of the lists is odd. In the case where the size is odd, the function returns the element at the index `size - 1`, but this index is out of bounds for the merged list because list indices in Python go from 0 to `length - 1`.

A correct implementation of the function would be:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

This corrected function calculates the median of the merged list, regardless of whether the size of the input lists is odd or even. 

For example, if the input lists are `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` with size `2`, the function will return `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, which is the correct median. If the input lists are `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` with size `3`, the function will return `4`, which is the correct median. 

In contrast, the original function would return incorrect results for these examples, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two lists of integers and their common length, merges and sorts the lists, and returns the median of the merged list, either as the average of the two middle elements if the length is even or the middle element if the length is odd, assuming the input lists are sorted and non-empty and the length parameter matches the list lengths.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
