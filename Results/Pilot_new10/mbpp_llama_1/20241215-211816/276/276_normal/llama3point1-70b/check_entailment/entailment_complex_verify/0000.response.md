Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I have determined the final correctness of the program.

The original assessment is `None`, indicating no prior evaluation of the program's correctness. 

Upon examining the code, the function `func_1` merges two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` into a single sorted list `merged_list`, and then calculates the median based on the length `size` of the input lists. If `size` is even, it correctly calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements. However, the calculation of the `middle_index` as `size - 1` is incorrect for this purpose. 

For a list of length `2 * size`, the middle indices should be `size` and `size - 1` for even lengths, not `size - 1` and `size`. Therefore, when `size` is even, the median should be calculated using `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`. When `size` is odd, the middle index should indeed be `size`, not `size - 1`, because the lists are 0-indexed. This means `merged_list[size]` should be used for odd lengths.

The annotated version of the code does lead me to believe that the original assessment (or lack thereof) is not entirely accurate, as it highlights the steps and assumptions made by the function but does not explicitly identify the mistake in calculating the median index.

Given this analysis, I find that the program does not accurately calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size due to the incorrect calculation of the middle index.

Final: **False**
