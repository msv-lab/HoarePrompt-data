The original assessment identifies several issues with the provided code. The main issue is that the function does not correctly calculate the median when the size of the lists is odd. However, upon closer inspection, the issue is not that the index is out of bounds, but rather that the middle index calculation is incorrect. 

The original code calculates the `middle_index` as `size - 1`. However, since the combined list has twice the size of the input lists, the correct calculation should indeed consider the total length of the merged list, not just the size of one input list.

A correct approach would be to calculate the `middle_index` based on the total length of the merged list, not the input size. Since the problem description assumes that the input lists are of the same size and that the length parameter matches the list lengths, we should calculate the median based on the merged list's properties.

The output hints suggest that the function should merge and sort the lists, then return the median of the merged list. The hints imply that the function should handle both even and odd lengths correctly, which the original code does not do due to the incorrect calculation of the `middle_index`.

However, considering that the code is supposed to calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size, the issue is indeed with how the `middle_index` is calculated and used, especially considering the combined list's length is twice the `size` parameter, which represents the length of one of the input lists.

The correct implementation provided in the original assessment properly addresses these issues by calculating the median based on the length of the merged list, ensuring that both even and odd cases are handled correctly.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code, the problem description, and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment that the provided code has a bug and does not correctly calculate the median for all cases.

Final: **False**
