Correctness: **False**.

The program has a bug in the line where it calculates the `middle_index`. The correct calculation should be `size - 1` for the combined list, but since the combined list has twice the size of the input lists, the correct calculation should be `(2 * size) // 2` or simply `size`. However, this is not the main issue.

The main issue is that the function does not correctly calculate the median when the size of the lists is odd. In the case where the size is odd, the function returns the element at the index `size - 1`, but this index is out of bounds for the merged list because list indices in Python go from 0 to `length - 1`.

A correct implementation of the function would be:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

This corrected function calculates the median of the merged list, regardless of whether the size of the input lists is odd or even. 

For example, if the input lists are `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` with size `2`, the function will return `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, which is the correct median. If the input lists are `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` with size `3`, the function will return `4`, which is the correct median. 

In contrast, the original function would return incorrect results for these examples, making it incorrect.
