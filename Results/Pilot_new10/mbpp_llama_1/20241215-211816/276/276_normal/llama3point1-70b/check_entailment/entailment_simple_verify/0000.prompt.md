You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program has a bug in the line where it calculates the `middle_index`. The correct calculation should be `size - 1` for the combined list, but since the combined list has twice the size of the input lists, the correct calculation should be `(2 * size) // 2` or simply `size`. However, this is not the main issue.

The main issue is that the function does not correctly calculate the median when the size of the lists is odd. In the case where the size is odd, the function returns the element at the index `size - 1`, but this index is out of bounds for the merged list because list indices in Python go from 0 to `length - 1`.

A correct implementation of the function would be:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

This corrected function calculates the median of the merged list, regardless of whether the size of the input lists is odd or even. 

For example, if the input lists are `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` with size `2`, the function will return `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, which is the correct median. If the input lists are `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` with size `3`, the function will return `4`, which is the correct median. 

In contrast, the original function would return incorrect results for these examples, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, size is a positive integer such that size == len(list1) and size == len(list2), and both list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, each with a length of `size`; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`; `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, the `median` is the average of the two middle elements `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`. If `size` is odd, the `median` is the middle element `merged_list[size]` however since `middle_index` is `size - 1`, it can be written as `merged_list[size - 1]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged list, which is either the average of the two middle elements if `size` is even, or the middle element if `size` is odd, from a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
