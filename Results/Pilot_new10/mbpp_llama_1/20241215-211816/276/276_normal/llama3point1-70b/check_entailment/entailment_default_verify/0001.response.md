The original assessment is **False**. The problem description specifically states that the two input lists are of the same size. However, the provided code does not correctly calculate the median when the size of the merged list is even. 

The issue arises from the line `middle_index = size - 1`. This line assumes that the size of the merged list is equal to `2*size`, which is correct according to the problem description. However, the code does not handle cases where the size of the lists are not the same.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts two lists of integers and their common length, merges and sorts the lists, and returns the median of the merged list. However, they also state that the function assumes the input lists are sorted and non-empty and the length parameter matches the list lengths.

The original assessment points out that the code does not handle cases where the size of the lists are not the same. This is a correct assessment because the code will throw an error if the size of the lists are not the same. For example, if `size = 3`, `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [4, 5, 6]`, the `merged_list` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. The program will calculate the median as `(merged_list[2] + merged_list[3]) / 2 = (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5` which is correct because the size of the `merged_list` is 6 which is even, but it should have taken `middle_index = 2` if `size = 3` was correct input.

To fix this issue, the code can be modified to calculate the `middle_index` based on the length of the `merged_list`, not the input `size`. Here is an example of how the code can be modified:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    size = len(merged_list)
    middle_index = size // 2
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
However, since the problem description specifically states that the two input lists are of the same size, the original code will work correctly if the input lists are of the same size.

But based on the output hints and the original assessment the code does not handle cases where the size of the input lists may not be known before and this is the reason why the final correctness of the program is **False**.

Final: **False**
