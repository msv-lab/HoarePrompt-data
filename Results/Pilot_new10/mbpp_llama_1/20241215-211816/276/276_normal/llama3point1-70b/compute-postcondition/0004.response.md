Postcondition: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, each with a length of `size`; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`; `middle_index` is `size - 1`; and `size` is odd, since `size % 2!= 0`**
