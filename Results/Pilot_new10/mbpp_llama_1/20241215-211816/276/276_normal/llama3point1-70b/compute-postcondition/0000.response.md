To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers.
   - `size` is a positive integer.
   - `size == len(list1)` and `size == len(list2)`, meaning both lists have the same length, equal to `size`.
   - Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code `merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)` merges `list1` and `list2` into a single list and then sorts this merged list in ascending order.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the operation; they are only read.
   - `size` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
   - A new variable `merged_list` is introduced, which is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`.

4. **Calculating the Result**:
   - Since `list1` and `list2` are both sorted in ascending order and have the same length `size`, the merged list will contain all elements from both lists, sorted in ascending order.
   - The length of `merged_list` will be `2 * size`, as it combines the elements of `list1` and `list2`.

5. **Output State**:
   - `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and each has a length of `size`.
   - `size` is a positive integer equal to the lengths of `list1` and `list2`.
   - `merged_list` is a list of integers, sorted in ascending order, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, each with a length of `size`; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`.**
