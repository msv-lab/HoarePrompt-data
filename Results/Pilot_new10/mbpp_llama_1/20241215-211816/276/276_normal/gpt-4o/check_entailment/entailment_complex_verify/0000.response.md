The original assessment is None, which indicates that there was no prior evaluation of the program's correctness. Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, we can assess the program's correctness.

The problem description asks for a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that merges two sorted lists, sorts the merged list, and calculates the median.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the program's state at different points. It confirms that the input lists are sorted and of the same length, and that the merged list is also sorted.

Upon examining the code, we can see that it correctly calculates the median for even-length merged lists by averaging the two middle numbers. However, since the problem description specifies that the two input lists are of the same size, the merged list will always have an even length. Therefore, the code's handling of odd-length merged lists is not applicable in this specific context.

Given that the program correctly calculates the median for even-length merged lists, which is the applicable case based on the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
