The original assessment is None, which means there was no initial judgment made about the program's correctness.

Upon reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, it is clear that the function `func_1` is designed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The code correctly merges the two lists, sorts the merged list, and calculates the median based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd.

The annotated version of the code provides a clear understanding of the state of the program at different points, especially after the if-else block has been executed. It correctly states that the `median` equals `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2` when the length of `merged_list` is even, which is the expected case given that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of both `list1` and `list2`, and the merged list has a length of `2n`.

Given that the annotated version aligns with the problem description and the provided code implements the correct logic for finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size, the original assessment of None (implying no judgment was made) can be updated based on the analysis.

The reason the original assessment is considered not directly applicable is that it did not provide a judgment. However, based on the analysis, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
