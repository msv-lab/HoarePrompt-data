You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's why:

1. It merges the two sorted lists into one list `merged_list` and sorts it.
2. It then finds the middle index `mid` of the `merged_list`.
3. If the length of `merged_list` is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers.
4. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, it calculates the median as the middle number.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Lists of different sizes are not handled by the function, but this is explicitly stated in the problem description that the lists are of the same size.
* Edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with duplicate elements, are not mentioned in the problem description, but the function would still work correctly for these cases.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios.

In conclusion, since the function correctly implements the logic to calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size and handles all potential cases, the Correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and a positive integer `n`, where `n` is the length of both lists, and returns the median of the sorted merged list of `list1` and `list2`, calculated as the average of the two middle numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
