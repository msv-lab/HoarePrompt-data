Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function `func_1` merges the two lists into one, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. The function takes two lists `list1` and `list2`, and their size `n` as input. It merges these lists into a single list `merged_list`.
2. The `merged_list` is then sorted in ascending order.
3. The median is calculated based on the length of the `merged_list`. If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the length is odd, the median is the middle number.
4. The function returns the calculated median.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for different inputs. The function handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list correctly.

Since the code correctly implements the logic to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size, and there are no apparent edge cases that it does not handle, the program is considered correct.
