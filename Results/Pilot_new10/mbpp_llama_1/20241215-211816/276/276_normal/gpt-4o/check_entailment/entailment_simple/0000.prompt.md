You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers, n is a positive integer such that len(list1) == n and len(list2) == n, and both lists are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order with length `2n`, `mid` equals `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` equals `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. Otherwise, given the corrected understanding that `merged_list` should have an even length based on `2n`, but proceeding with the provided condition for analysis, `median` would equal `merged_list[n]`. However, based on the standard interpretation of the problem's initial conditions implying an even-length `merged_list`, the condition for an odd length is not applicable, leading to the simplification: `median` equals `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median, which is the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged_list, calculated as (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2, where merged_list is a sorted list of length 2n containing all elements from the sorted lists list1 and list2.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
