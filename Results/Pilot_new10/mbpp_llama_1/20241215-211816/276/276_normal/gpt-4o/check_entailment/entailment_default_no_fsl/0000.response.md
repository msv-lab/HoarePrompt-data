Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to correctly implement the function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's why:

1. The function merges the two input lists, `list1` and `list2`, into a single list, `merged_list`, and sorts this list in ascending order.

2. It then calculates the middle index (`mid`) of this merged list.

3. If the length of the `merged_list` is even, which will be the case since the two input lists are of the same length and the total length is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers (`merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`).

4. The function handles the case when the total length of the merged list is odd by returning the middle number (`merged_list[mid]`).

However, it's worth noting that the problem description specifically states that the two input lists are of the same size. The provided code does not explicitly validate this condition, but it does assume it when calculating the median. Since the problem description does not mention what should happen if the lists are of different sizes, and the code does not handle such a case explicitly, the assumption here seems to align with the problem's constraints.

The provided unit tests also validate the function's correctness for different sets of input lists, and the code passes these tests. Given the information provided and assuming the input lists will always be of the same size as per the problem description, the code appears to correctly calculate the median of the merged list for all potential cases within the specified constraints.
