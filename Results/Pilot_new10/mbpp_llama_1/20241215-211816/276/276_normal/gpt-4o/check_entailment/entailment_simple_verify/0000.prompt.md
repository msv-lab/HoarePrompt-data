You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's why:

1. It merges the two sorted lists into one list `merged_list` and sorts it.
2. It then finds the middle index `mid` of the `merged_list`.
3. If the length of `merged_list` is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers.
4. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, it calculates the median as the middle number.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Lists of different sizes are not handled by the function, but this is explicitly stated in the problem description that the lists are of the same size.
* Edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with duplicate elements, are not mentioned in the problem description, but the function would still work correctly for these cases.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios.

In conclusion, since the function correctly implements the logic to calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size and handles all potential cases, the Correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers, n is a positive integer such that len(list1) == n and len(list2) == n, and both lists are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order with length `2n`, `mid` equals `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` equals `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. Otherwise, given the corrected understanding that `merged_list` should have an even length based on `2n`, but proceeding with the provided condition for analysis, `median` would equal `merged_list[n]`. However, based on the standard interpretation of the problem's initial conditions implying an even-length `merged_list`, the condition for an odd length is not applicable, leading to the simplification: `median` equals `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median, which is the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged_list, calculated as (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2, where merged_list is a sorted list of length 2n containing all elements from the sorted lists list1 and list2.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
