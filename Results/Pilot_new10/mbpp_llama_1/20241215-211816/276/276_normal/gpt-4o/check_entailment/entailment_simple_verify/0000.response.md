The original assessment seems accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version of the code also supports the original assessment. 

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It merges the two lists, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median. If the length of the merged list is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers. If the length of the merged list is odd, it calculates the median as the middle number. However, since the problem states that the lists are of the same size, the merged list will always have an even length, making the calculation for the odd case unnecessary.

The annotations in the code also describe the state of the program correctly. Before the function call, `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers, `n` is a positive integer such that `len(list1) == n` and `len(list2) == n`, and both lists are sorted in ascending order. After the if-else block, `median` is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers in the merged list.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function handles all potential cases correctly, including lists of the same size and edge cases such as lists with duplicate elements.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
