The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The code correctly implements the logic to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

The function `func_1` merges the two lists into one, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd. This is in line with the problem description, which requires finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

The output hints also support the original assessment. The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers and a positive integer `n`, where `n` is the length of both lists, and returns the median of the sorted merged list. The hints mention that the median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers when the length of the merged list is even, which is consistent with the code's implementation.

There are no apparent edge cases that the code does not handle, given the assumption that the input will be valid. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for different inputs.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment appears to be accurate.

Final: **True**
