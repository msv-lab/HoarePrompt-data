The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd.

The output hints provided match the functionality of the code. The code accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2`, and a positive integer `n` which is the length of both lists. It returns the median of the sorted merged list of `list1` and `list2`, calculated as the average of the two middle numbers when the length of the merged list is even.

The problem description explicitly states that the lists are of the same size, which is handled correctly by the function. The function also correctly handles the cases where the length of the merged list is even or odd.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios. The function works as expected and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains the same as the original assessment.

Final: **True**
