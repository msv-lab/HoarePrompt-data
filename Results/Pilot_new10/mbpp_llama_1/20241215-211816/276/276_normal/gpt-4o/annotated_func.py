#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers, n is a positive integer such that len(list1) == n and len(list2) == n, and both lists are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order with length `2n`, `mid` equals `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` equals `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. Otherwise, given the corrected understanding that `merged_list` should have an even length based on `2n`, but proceeding with the provided condition for analysis, `median` would equal `merged_list[n]`. However, based on the standard interpretation of the problem's initial conditions implying an even-length `merged_list`, the condition for an odd length is not applicable, leading to the simplification: `median` equals `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median, which is the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged_list, calculated as (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2, where merged_list is a sorted list of length 2n containing all elements from the sorted lists list1 and list2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and a positive integer `n`, where `n` is the length of both lists, and returns the median of the sorted merged list of `list1` and `list2`, calculated as the average of the two middle numbers.
