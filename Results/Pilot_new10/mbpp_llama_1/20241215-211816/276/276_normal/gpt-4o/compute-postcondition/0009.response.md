The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: two sorted lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and a positive integer `n`, where `n` is the length of both `list1` and `list2`. 

Looking at the code, it first merges `list1` and `list2` into a new list `merged_list` and sorts it in ascending order. It then calculates the median of `merged_list`. 

If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, the median is the middle number. However, given that `merged_list` is formed by concatenating two lists of length `n`, its total length will always be `2n`, which is even. 

Thus, the function will always calculate the median as the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted `merged_list`. 

This functionality covers all potential cases, including the edge case where the two input lists are of equal length `n` and are sorted, as specified in the annotations. 

Since the length of `merged_list` is always even (specifically, `2n`), the condition for an odd length in the code is not applicable in the context of the problem as described.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and a positive integer `n`, where `n` is the length of both lists, and returns the median of the sorted merged list of `list1` and `list2`, calculated as the average of the two middle numbers. **
