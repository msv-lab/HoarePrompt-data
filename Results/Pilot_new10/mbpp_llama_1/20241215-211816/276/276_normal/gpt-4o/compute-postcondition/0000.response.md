The code merges `list1` and `list2` into a new list `merged_list` and sorts it in ascending order. The lengths of `list1` and `list2` are both `n`, and both lists are initially sorted in ascending order.

`merged_list` is assigned the value of `sorted(list1 + list2)`, which means it will contain all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order. The lengths of `list1` and `list2` remain `n`, and their contents remain the same.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order with length `2n`.**
