To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `list1` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`.
- `list2` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order with length `2n`.

The code snippet is:
```python
mid = len(merged_list) // 2
```

This code calculates the middle index of `merged_list` and assigns it to the variable `mid`. 

Given that `merged_list` has a length of `2n`, the middle index `mid` will be calculated as follows:
- `len(merged_list)` equals `2n` because `merged_list` contains all elements from `list1` and `list2`, and each of these lists has `n` elements.
- Therefore, `mid = 2n // 2 = n`.

The states of `list1`, `list2`, `n`, and `merged_list` are not affected by this operation. Only a new variable `mid` is introduced, which equals `n`.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order with length `2n`, and `mid` equals `n`.**
