You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occcurences of the element in the tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup, elem):
    return tup.count(elem)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly counts the occurrences of the element `elem` in the tuple `tup` using the built-in `count` method of Python tuples. This method returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple.

The function does not have any apparent flaws or edge cases that would cause it to fail. It correctly handles:

- Empty tuples: If the tuple is empty, `count` will return 0, which is the correct result.
- Single-element tuples: If the tuple contains only one element, `count` will return 1 if the element matches `elem`, and 0 otherwise.
- Tuples with duplicate elements: `count` will correctly count the occurrences of `elem` even if it appears multiple times in the tuple.
- Tuples with different data types: `count` will work correctly even if the tuple contains elements of different data types, as long as `elem` is of a type that can be compared with the elements of the tuple.

Since the function correctly handles all these cases, and there are no apparent logical errors or missing edge cases, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and elem is any type of object that can be compared to elements in tup.
def func_1(tup, elem):
    return tup.count(elem)
    #The program returns the number of times `elem` appears in the tuple `tup`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
