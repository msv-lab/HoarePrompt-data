#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and elem is any type of object that can be compared to elements in tup.
def func_1(tup, elem):
    return tup.count(elem)
    #The program returns the number of times `elem` appears in the tuple `tup`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`, handling all potential cases including empty tuples and elements of any comparable type.
