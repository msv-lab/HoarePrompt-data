The `count()` method in Python returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. In this case, `tup` is a tuple and `element` is any type of object that can be compared with the elements in the tuple.

Given the initial state, the program will return the number of times `element` appears in `tup`. This means the return value will be an integer representing the count of `element` in `tup`.

Output State: **The program returns the number of occurrences of 'element' in tuple 'tup'**
