The original assessment does not make sense as it states "None", which implies that no evaluation was made. However, based on the provided code and the problem description, the function `func_1` accurately counts the occurrences of the given element in the tuple using the built-in `count` method.

The output hints further reinforce this by stating that the function accepts a tuple and an element, and returns the number of occurrences of the element in the tuple, which aligns with the problem description.

The function does not explicitly handle cases such as non-tuple inputs or non-comparable elements, but as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, based on the information provided, the function is correct.

The output hints also provide additional information about the function's behavior in edge cases, such as when the tuple is empty or the element is not found, but these cases are handled correctly by the function.

Final: **True**
