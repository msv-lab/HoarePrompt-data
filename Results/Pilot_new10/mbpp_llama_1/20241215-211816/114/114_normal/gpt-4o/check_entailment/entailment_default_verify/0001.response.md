The original assessment is none, so there's no previous assessment to build upon. 

Based on the problem description, the code provided, and the output hints, the function `func_1` seems to correctly count the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The function uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

The output hints also support the correctness of the function. They describe the behavior of the function in various scenarios, including when the tuple is empty or when the element is not found in the tuple.

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any error checking to ensure that the input `tup` is indeed a tuple or that `element` is a comparable object. But since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the function.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the final assessment is:

Final: **True**
