You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occcurences of the element in the tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4) == 0
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10) == 3
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 8) == 4

def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately counts the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The function utilizes the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

The `count` method is a standard library function in Python that works correctly for tuples and lists. It correctly handles edge cases such as an empty tuple or a tuple with no occurrences of the specified element.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the function, covering cases where the element is present multiple times, present zero times, and the tuple contains duplicate elements.

In addition to the provided unit tests, the function should also work correctly for other potential cases, such as:
- An empty tuple.
- A tuple with a single element that is or is not the target element.
- A tuple with negative numbers or non-integer elements.

For example:
```python
print(func_1((), 10))  # Output: 0
print(func_1((10,), 10))  # Output: 1
print(func_1((10,), 5))  # Output: 0
print(func_1((-1, 0, 1), 0))  # Output: 1
print(func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'), 'a'))  # Output: 1
```
All of these cases should be handled correctly by the `func_1` function, which suggests that it is a correct implementation of the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and returns the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`. If `tup` is not a tuple, it raises an AttributeError. If `element` is not a comparable object, it raises a TypeError. If `tup` is an empty tuple or `element` is not found in `tup`, it returns 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
