Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately counts the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The function utilizes the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

The `count` method is a standard library function in Python that works correctly for tuples and lists. It correctly handles edge cases such as an empty tuple or a tuple with no occurrences of the specified element.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the function, covering cases where the element is present multiple times, present zero times, and the tuple contains duplicate elements.

In addition to the provided unit tests, the function should also work correctly for other potential cases, such as:
- An empty tuple.
- A tuple with a single element that is or is not the target element.
- A tuple with negative numbers or non-integer elements.

For example:
```python
print(func_1((), 10))  # Output: 0
print(func_1((10,), 10))  # Output: 1
print(func_1((10,), 5))  # Output: 0
print(func_1((-1, 0, 1), 0))  # Output: 1
print(func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'), 'a'))  # Output: 1
```
All of these cases should be handled correctly by the `func_1` function, which suggests that it is a correct implementation of the problem description.
