Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly checks if a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if the corresponding closing brackets are in the correct order. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the function works:

1. The function initializes an empty stack and a dictionary `brackets` that maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.
2. It iterates over each character in the input expression. If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., it's a key in the `brackets` dictionary), it pushes the character onto the stack.
3. If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., it's a value in the `brackets` dictionary), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not correspond to the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the expression is not balanced.
4. After iterating over the entire expression, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that all opening brackets were properly closed, and the function returns `True`, indicating that the expression is balanced. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are some opening brackets that were not closed, and the function returns `False`.

The function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty expressions
* Expressions with properly balanced brackets
* Expressions with unbalanced brackets
* Expressions with nested brackets

Since I couldn't find any case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the function is correct.
