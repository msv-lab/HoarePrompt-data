You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
    return not stack


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a solution to the problem of checking if a given expression is balanced or not. The function `func_1` uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if they match with the corresponding closing brackets.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It initializes an empty stack `stack` to store the opening brackets.
2. It defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps each opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket.
3. It iterates over each character in the input `expression`.
4. If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., it's a key in the `brackets` dictionary), it pushes the character onto the stack.
5. If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., it's a value in the `brackets` dictionary), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack doesn't match with the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`.
6. After iterating over the entire expression, it checks if the stack is empty. If it's not, that means there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Balanced expressions: `func_1("({[]})")` returns `True`
* Unbalanced expressions: `func_1("({[})")` returns `False`
* Empty expressions: `func_1("")` returns `True`
* Expressions with only opening brackets: `func_1("({[")` returns `False`
* Expressions with only closing brackets: `func_1(")}]")` returns `False`

I couldn't find any case where the program doesn't work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string `expression` and returns True if all brackets are properly matched and balanced, and False otherwise, considering cases where closing brackets do not match their corresponding opening brackets, or where there are unmatched opening brackets at the end of the string

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
