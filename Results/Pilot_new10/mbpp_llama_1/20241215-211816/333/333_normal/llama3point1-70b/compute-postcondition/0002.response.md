To execute the given for loop, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement: `char` and `expression`. 

1. `expression` is already given as a string containing characters typically used in expressions. For the loop to execute, `expression` must not be empty, meaning it must contain at least one character.

2. `char` is the variable that will take the value of each character in `expression` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `char` is not defined in the given state, but for the loop to execute, it will be defined and take the value of the first character in `expression` at the start of the first iteration.

3. `stack` is given as an empty list and `brackets` is given as a dictionary mapping opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets. Neither `stack` nor `brackets` directly affects the execution of the for loop itself, as the loop iterates over `expression`. However, their states are part of the overall program state.

Given these considerations, for the loop to execute, `expression` must have at least one character, and `char` will be defined as the first character of `expression` at the start of the loop.

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing characters, `char` is the first character in `expression`, `stack` is an empty list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}**
