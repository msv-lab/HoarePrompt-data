Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string containing characters, `char` is the first character in `expression`, `stack` is a list, and `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}. If `char` is a key in the `brackets` dictionary, `stack` contains the value of `char`. If `char` is a value in the `brackets` dictionary, either the stack is empty and its state remains unchanged, or it is not empty and the last opening bracket in the stack matches the current closing bracket `char`, or after popping the last element from the stack, the popped opening bracket matches the current closing bracket `char`. If `char` is neither a key nor a value in the `brackets` dictionary, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
