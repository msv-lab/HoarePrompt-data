The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `expression`. `expression` is a string containing characters that are typically used in expressions, such as parentheses, brackets, and braces. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the brackets in the expression string are balanced. The return value is determined by the following conditions: 

If the function encounters a closing bracket that does not match the last opening bracket, it returns False. 
If the stack is empty when encountering a closing bracket, it returns False. 
If there are no other conditions met, the function returns True if there are no unmatched opening brackets; otherwise, it returns False. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `expression` and return `True` if the brackets in the `expression` are balanced and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter expression containing characters used in expressions and returns True if the brackets are balanced, False otherwise.**
