To determine the output state, let's consider the impact of the code on the program.

The code `stack.append(char)` adds the current value of `char` to the end of the `stack` list. 

Given the initial state:
- `expression` is a non-empty string containing characters.
- `char` is the first character in `expression` and is a bracket that has a corresponding closing bracket.
- `stack` is an empty list.
- `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}.
- The current value of `char` is a key in the `brackets` dictionary.

After executing `stack.append(char)`, the `stack` list will contain the first character of `expression`, which is a bracket.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `expression` is a non-empty string containing characters.
- `char` is the first character in `expression` and is a bracket that has a corresponding closing bracket.
- `stack` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `char`, a bracket that is a key in the `brackets` dictionary.
- `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}.
- The current value of `char` is a key in the `brackets` dictionary.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing characters, `char` is the first character in `expression` and is a bracket that has a corresponding closing bracket, `stack` is a list containing the value of `char`, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, and the current value of `char` is a key in the `brackets` dictionary**
