Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing at least one more character, `char` is the third character in `expression`, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}}. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the character, the function returns False. Otherwise, the stack is updated by popping the top element and the program continues execution.***
