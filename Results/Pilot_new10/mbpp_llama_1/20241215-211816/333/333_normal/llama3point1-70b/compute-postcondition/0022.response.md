Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing at least one more character, `char` is the third character in `expression`, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}}. If `char` is a closing bracket and the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the character, the function returns False. Otherwise, if `char` is a closing bracket, the stack is updated by popping the top element and the program continues execution. If `char` is not a closing bracket, the program continues execution without any changes.***
