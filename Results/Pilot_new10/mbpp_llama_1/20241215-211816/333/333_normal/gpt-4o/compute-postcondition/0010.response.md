Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is a list, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets where ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', `char` is the first character in `expr`. If `char` is one of the closing brackets, i.e., `char` is one of ')', ']', or '}', the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket of the current character. If `char` is not one of the closing brackets, the state remains unchanged as there is no specified action in the else part.***
