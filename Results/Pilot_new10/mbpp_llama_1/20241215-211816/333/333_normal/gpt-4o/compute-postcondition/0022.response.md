Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and has at least one more character after the first character has been removed, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets. If the current character is in `matching_pairs`, then if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the current character according to `matching_pairs`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning False. If the current character is not in `matching_pairs`, the program continues execution without returning False.***
