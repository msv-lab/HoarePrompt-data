Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and has at least one more character, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets. If the `stack` is empty or the top of the `stack` does not match the current character `char` according to `matching_pairs`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the `stack` is updated accordingly, with its top element removed if it matches the current character `char`.***
