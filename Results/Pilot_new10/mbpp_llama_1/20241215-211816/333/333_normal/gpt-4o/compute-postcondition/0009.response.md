Postcondition: **`expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is a list, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets where ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', `char` is the first character in `expr`, the current value of `char` is one of the closing brackets, i.e., `char` is one of ')', ']', or '}', since `char` is a key in `matching_pairs`. The stack is not empty and the top element of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket of the current character, i.e., the top element of the stack is equal to the value of `matching_pairs[char]`.**
