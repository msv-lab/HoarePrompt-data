The provided code defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` that maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets. This code does not directly modify the `expr` or `stack` variables but sets up a dictionary that could be used in subsequent operations to evaluate or manipulate the string `expr` based on its content of parentheses, brackets, or braces.

The `matching_pairs` dictionary is now defined as `{'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}'}` is not correct, instead it is `{'')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}`. 

The states of `expr` and `stack` are not affected by this code snippet as it only declares a new dictionary. 

Output State: **`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets where ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.**
