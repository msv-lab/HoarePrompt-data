According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expr`. If `expr` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `expr` has at least one more character. For the loop to execute again, `expr` must have at least one more character after the current character has been processed, so the first character has been removed from `expr`. The `char` variable now holds the next character in `expr`.
State: **`expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and has at least one more character after the first character has been removed, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets where ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'**
