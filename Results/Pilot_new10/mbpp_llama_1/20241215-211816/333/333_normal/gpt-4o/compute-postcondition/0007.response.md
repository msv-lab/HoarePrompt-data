Postcondition: **`expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is a list, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets where ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', `char` is the first character in `expr`, the current value of `char` is one of the closing brackets, i.e., `char` is one of ')', ']', or '}', since `char` is a key in `matching_pairs`. The current state of `stack` is either an empty list or if it's not empty, the top element of `stack` does not match the corresponding opening bracket of `char` as defined in `matching_pairs`.**
