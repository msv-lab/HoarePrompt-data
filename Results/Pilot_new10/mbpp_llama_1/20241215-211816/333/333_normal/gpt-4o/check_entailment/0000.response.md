Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, checks if a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if they match with the corresponding closing brackets. 

The function iterates over each character in the expression. If it encounters an opening bracket (`'(', '[', '{'`), it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket (`')', ']', '}'`), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match with the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`, indicating that the expression is not balanced.

After iterating over all characters, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that all opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, and the function returns `True`, indicating that the expression is balanced. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns `False`.

The function seems to handle all possible cases correctly, including:

- Empty expression
- Expression with only opening brackets
- Expression with only closing brackets
- Expression with matching and non-matching brackets
- Expression with nested brackets

The provided unit tests also pass, which further supports the correctness of the function. 

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
