You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
    return stack == []


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, checks if a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if they match with the corresponding closing brackets. 

The function iterates over each character in the expression. If it encounters an opening bracket (`'(', '[', '{'`), it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket (`')', ']', '}'`), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match with the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`, indicating that the expression is not balanced.

After iterating over all characters, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that all opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, and the function returns `True`, indicating that the expression is balanced. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns `False`.

The function seems to handle all possible cases correctly, including:

- Empty expression
- Expression with only opening brackets
- Expression with only closing brackets
- Expression with matching and non-matching brackets
- Expression with nested brackets

The provided unit tests also pass, which further supports the correctness of the function. 

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string `expr` containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, and returns True if `expr` has matching brackets or no brackets, and False if `expr` has unmatched opening or closing brackets, or if there are more opening brackets than closing brackets

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
