Correctness: **True**

The given code defines a function `func_1` that checks if a given expression containing parentheses, brackets, or braces is balanced. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if each closing bracket has a corresponding opening bracket. The function returns `True` if the expression is balanced and `False` otherwise.

The code handles all potential cases correctly:

1. **Matching brackets**: The code correctly handles expressions with matching brackets, such as `'{()}[{}] '` and `'{()}[{}][]({})'`, returning `True`.
2. **Unmatched opening brackets**: The code correctly handles expressions with unmatched opening brackets, such as `'{()]['`, returning `False`.
3. **Unmatched closing brackets**: The code correctly handles expressions with unmatched closing brackets, such as `'({)]'`, returning `False`.
4. **No brackets**: The code correctly handles expressions with no brackets, implicitly returning `True`.

The output hints also agree with the code's behavior, and the provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases.

Overall, the code is well-structured and handles all potential cases correctly, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.
