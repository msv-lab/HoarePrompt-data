Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether all items in the given list `lst` are equal to the specified `element`. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The function iterates through each item in the list `lst`. If it finds an item that is not equal to the specified `element`, it immediately returns `False`.

2. If the function completes the iteration without finding any item that is not equal to the `element`, it returns `True`, indicating that all items in the list are equal to the `element`.

3. The function also handles the case where the list is empty. In Python, an empty list will not cause the `for` loop to execute, so the function will implicitly return `True` for an empty list, which aligns with the problem description's requirement that the function should return `True` if all items in the list are equal to the `element` or if the list is empty.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description and handles all potential cases, making it a correct solution. 

However, to further improve the function and make it explicit about its behavior with an empty list, the function could be modified as follows:

```python
def func_1(lst, element):
    if not lst:  # Check if the list is empty
        return True
    
    for item in lst:
        if item!= element:
            return False
        
    return True
```

Or, a more concise version could be:

```python
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
```

This version uses the built-in `all()` function and a generator expression to check if all items in the list are equal to the specified `element`. The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. If at least one element is false, it returns `False`. If the iterable is empty, `all()` returns `True`.
