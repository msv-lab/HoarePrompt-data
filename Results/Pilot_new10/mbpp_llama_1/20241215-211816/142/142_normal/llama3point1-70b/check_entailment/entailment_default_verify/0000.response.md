The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(lst, element)` checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element, which aligns with the problem description. The reasoning behind the original assessment is sound, as it considers various potential cases, including an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements, and correctly concludes that the function behaves as expected in all these cases.

The output hints provided also match the expected behavior of the function as described in the original assessment. The function returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element or if the list is empty, and `False` otherwise. This behavior is consistent with the problem description and the original assessment.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
