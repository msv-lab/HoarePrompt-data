The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(lst, element)` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The use of the built-in Python function `all()` along with a generator expression is a suitable approach for this problem. 

The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment, as it correctly describes the state of the program before the function call and the return value of the function. The annotation indicates that the program returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem description.

Given that the input to the program is assumed to be valid, the function does not need to handle cases such as an empty list or an input that is not a list. However, it is worth noting that the function will still work correctly for these cases due to the properties of the `all()` function, which returns `True` for an empty iterable.

Therefore, based on the information available, it appears that the original assessment is accurate, and the function is correct according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
