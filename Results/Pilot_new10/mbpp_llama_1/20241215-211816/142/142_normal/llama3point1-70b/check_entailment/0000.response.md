Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(lst, element)` checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. This function uses the built-in Python function `all()`, which returns `True` if all elements in an iterable are true. In this case, the iterable is a generator expression that compares each item in the list to the given element. If any item in the list is not equal to the element, the `all()` function will short-circuit and return `False`.

I have considered several potential cases:

- An empty list: In this case, the function will return `True` because `all()` will be called on an empty iterable.
- A list with a single element: The function will return `True` if the element matches, `False` otherwise.
- A list with multiple elements, all equal to the given element: The function will return `True`.
- A list with multiple elements, some of which are not equal to the given element: The function will return `False`.

I could not find any potential case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
