Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function that checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

In the annotated program, the function `func_1` uses the built-in `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to check if all items in the list `lst` are equal to the `element`. 

If all items in the list are equal to the `element`, the `all()` function returns `True`. If at least one item in the list is not equal to the `element`, the `all()` function returns `False`. 

Additionally, the `all()` function also correctly handles the case where the list `lst` is empty, in which case it returns `True`. This is because the `all()` function considers an empty iterable to be "true", since there are no False values to contradict it.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and it correctly handles all potential cases.
