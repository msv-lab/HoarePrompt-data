To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet in the context of the provided initial state. The initial state tells us that `lst` is a list and `element` is any type of object that can be compared with the items in `lst`. The code snippet is `return all(item == element for item in lst)`.

This code uses the `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to check if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`. The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. If at least one element is false, it returns `False`.

Given the initial state, the impact of the code is to evaluate the equality of each item in `lst` with `element`. Since `element` can be any type of object that can be compared with the items in `lst`, and `lst` is a list of items that can be compared with `element`, the comparison `item == element` will yield a boolean value (`True` or `False`) for each item in `lst`.

The `all()` function will then return `True` if and only if every item in `lst` is equal to `element`. If there is at least one item in `lst` that is not equal to `element`, `all()` will return `False`.

Therefore, the output state is a boolean value indicating whether all items in `lst` are equal to `element`.

Output State: **The program returns True if all items in lst are equal to element, False otherwise**
