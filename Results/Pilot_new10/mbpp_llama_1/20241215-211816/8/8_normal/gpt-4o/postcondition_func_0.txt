The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and returns either the original string `s` if `ch` appears less than twice in `s`, or a modified string derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` and the substring between them removed (excluding the first and last `ch` themselves) if `ch` appears more than once in `s`.
