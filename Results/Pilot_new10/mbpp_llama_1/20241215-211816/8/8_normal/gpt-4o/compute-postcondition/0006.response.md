The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` and `ch`, where `s` is a string and `ch` is a single character string that exists at least once in `s`. After executing the function body, there are two possible return cases: 
Case_1: The function returns the original string `s`. 
Case_2: The function returns a modified string derived from `s`, where the first and last occurrences of `ch` are removed along with any characters between these occurrences, excluding the first and last `ch` themselves. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `ch`, and return either the original string `s` or a modified string with the specified characters and substring removed.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters s and ch, returns either the original string s or a modified string derived from s with the first and last occurrences of ch and the substring between them removed.**
