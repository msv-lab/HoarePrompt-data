Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string that exists at least once in `s`, the current value of `first_index` is either the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, and the current value of `last_index` is either the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found. The current state of the variables is such that either `ch` does not exist in `s` (indicated by `first_index` or `last_index` being -1) or `ch` exists only once in `s` (indicated by `first_index` being equal to `last_index`), meaning the first and last indices of `ch` in `s` are either both -1 or equal to each other.**
