You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. After analyzing the function, it appears to correctly handle various edge cases and follows the problem description for every potential case.

Here are the key points that support the correctness of the function:

1. **Handling missing characters**: If the given character is not found in the string, the function returns the original string, which is the correct behavior. This is achieved by checking if `first_index` or `last_index` is -1.

2. **Handling single occurrence**: If the given character appears only once in the string, the function returns the string with that single character removed. This is handled implicitly by the conditions in the function.

3. **Handling multiple occurrences**: If the given character appears multiple times in the string, the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences.

4. **Preserving the order**: The function preserves the order of characters in the string by using slicing operations to exclude the first and last occurrences of the given character.

5. **Handling edge cases**: The function seems to correctly handle edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with only one character.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function, as they cover various scenarios and do not raise any `AssertionError`.

Since the function appears to work correctly for all potential cases, and no counterexample could be found, the conclusion is that the code is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string that exists at least once in s.
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns string `s`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string that exists at least once in `s`, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`. Additionally, `first_index` is not equal to -1, `last_index` is not equal to -1, and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`, meaning that `ch` appears more than once in `s` and both the first and last occurrences of `ch` have valid indices.
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns a string that is derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed, along with any characters between these occurrences (excluding the first and last `ch` themselves).


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
