The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. 

The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment. It correctly identifies the states of the program at different points and describes how the function handles different cases.

The function uses `find()` to get the index of the first occurrence of the character and `rfind()` to get the index of the last occurrence. It checks if the character is not found in the string or if it appears only once, and handles these cases correctly by returning the original string. 

However, upon closer inspection, the function seems to be removing not just the first and last occurrences of the character, but also all characters between these occurrences (excluding the first and last occurrences themselves). This is not exactly as per the problem description, which asks to remove only the first and last occurrences of the character.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate. The function does not correctly implement the required functionality as per the problem description.

Final: **False**
