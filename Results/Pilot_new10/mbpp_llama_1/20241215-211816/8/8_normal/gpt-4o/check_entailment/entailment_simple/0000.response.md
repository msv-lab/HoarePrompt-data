Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it removes all occurrences of the given character between the first and last occurrence, not just the first and last occurrence.

For example, if we have the string "hello world" and we want to remove the first and last occurrence of the character 'l', the program will return "heo worl" instead of "heol world", which is the expected result.

The correct implementation should only remove the first and last occurrence of the character, leaving all other occurrences intact. The current implementation removes all occurrences between the first and last occurrence, which is not the expected behavior.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1: last_index] + s[last_index+1:]
```
However, this is still incorrect as it should be 
```python
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:] + s[last_index:]
```
This corrected version will remove only the first and last occurrences of the character, leaving all other occurrences intact.
