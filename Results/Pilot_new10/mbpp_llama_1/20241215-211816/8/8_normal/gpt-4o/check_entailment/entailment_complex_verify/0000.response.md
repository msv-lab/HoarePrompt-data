The original assessment states that the program is correct, and after reviewing the annotated version of the code, I believe this assessment is actually incorrect. The problem description requires removing only the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string, but the annotated code and the original code indicate that the function removes not only the first and last occurrences of the character but also any characters between these occurrences (excluding the first and last character themselves).

The issue lies in the line where the function returns the modified string:

```python
return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

This line of code essentially removes all characters between the first and last occurrence of `ch`, not just the first and last `ch` themselves. The correct implementation should preserve the characters between the first and last occurrences of `ch`, except for the first and last `ch` which should be removed.

Given this understanding, I conclude that the original assessment was not accurate because the function does not behave as described in the problem statement.

Final: **False**
