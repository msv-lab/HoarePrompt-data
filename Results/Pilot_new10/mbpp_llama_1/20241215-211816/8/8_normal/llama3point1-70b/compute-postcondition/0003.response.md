Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character that is present at least twice in `s`, the current value of `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` and is not -1, and the current value of `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, which is equal to `s.rfind(char)` and is not -1. The current value of `first_occurrence` is equal to the current value of `last_occurrence`, meaning that the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s` are the same index, implying `char` is actually present only once in `s`.**
