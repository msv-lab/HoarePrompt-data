To calculate the output state, we need to understand the given code snippet and the initial state. The initial state provides that `s` is a string, `char` is a single character present at least twice in `s`, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` and is not -1, and `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` and is also not -1. Moreover, `first_occurrence` is not equal to `last_occurrence`, indicating that `char` appears more than once in `s`.

The given code snippet is:
```python
return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
```
This code snippet is removing the first and last occurrences of `char` from the string `s`. Here's how it works:

1. `s[:first_occurrence]` returns all characters in `s` before the first occurrence of `char`.
2. `s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence]` returns all characters between the first and last occurrences of `char`, excluding the first occurrence (due to `+1`) and the last occurrence (because the end index in Python's slice notation is exclusive).
3. `s[last_occurrence + 1:]` returns all characters in `s` after the last occurrence of `char`.

By concatenating these three parts, the code effectively removes the first and last occurrences of `char` from `s`, along with any occurrences of `char` that are at the indices `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence`.

Given the initial state and the operation performed by the code snippet, the program returns a string that is derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed.

Output State: **The program returns a string derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed, where `s` is the original string, and `char` is a character that appears at least twice in `s`.**
