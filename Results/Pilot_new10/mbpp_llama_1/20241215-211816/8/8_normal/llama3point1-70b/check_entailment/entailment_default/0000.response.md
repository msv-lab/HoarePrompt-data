Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the function to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. 

Here is a breakdown of how the code works:

1. It uses the `find` method to get the index of the first occurrence of the character and the `rfind` method to get the index of the last occurrence.

2. If the character appears more than once in the string, it removes the first and last occurrences by concatenating slices of the string around these indices.

3. If the character appears only once in the string, it removes this single occurrence using the `replace` method with a count of 1.

4. If the character does not appear at all in the string, it simply returns the original string.

The code correctly handles all potential cases:

- When the character appears more than once, it correctly removes the first and last occurrences.
- When the character appears only once, it correctly removes this single occurrence.
- When the character does not appear at all, it correctly returns the original string.

The output hints agree with the code and describe the functionality accurately, which further confirms the correctness of the code. Therefore, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
