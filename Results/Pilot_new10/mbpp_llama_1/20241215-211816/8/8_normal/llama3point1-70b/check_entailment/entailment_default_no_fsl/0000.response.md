Correctness: **True**

The code provided implements a Python function that correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string, if the character appears more than once in the string. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

- The function uses the `find()` and `rfind()` methods to locate the first and last occurrences of the character in the string, respectively. If the character is not found, these methods return -1, which is correctly handled by the function.

- If the character appears only once in the string, the function replaces this single occurrence with an empty string, effectively removing it. This is in line with the problem description's requirement to remove the first and last occurrences, even if they are the same.

- If the character appears more than once, the function constructs a new string by concatenating three substrings: one before the first occurrence of the character, one between the first and last occurrences (excluding the character at both ends), and one after the last occurrence of the character. This effectively removes both the first and last occurrences of the character.

- The function handles the case where the character does not appear in the string by returning the original string, as specified.

Given the provided output hints, the function behaves as described, removing the first and last occurrences of the specified character if it appears more than once, or returning the original string if it appears once or not at all. There are no apparent edge cases that the code fails to handle according to the problem description.
