You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- It first finds the index of the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(char)`.
- Then, it finds the index of the last occurrence of the character using `s.rfind(char)`.
- If both occurrences are found (i.e., their indices are not -1), it checks if they are the same index. If they are the same, it means the character appears only once in the string, so it removes one occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
- If the first and last occurrences are at different indices, it removes both occurrences by concatenating the substrings before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding the character at these positions), and after the last occurrence.
- If the character is not found in the string (i.e., `find` or `rfind` returns -1), it simply returns the original string.

This logic handles all potential cases, including:
- The character appears more than once in the string.
- The character appears only once in the string.
- The character does not appear in the string.
- The string is empty.
- The character is at the start or end of the string.

Since all these cases are handled correctly, and the function behaves as described in the problem statement, the correctness of the program is validated.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string `s` and a character `char`, and returns a new string where the first and last occurrences of `char` are removed if `char` appears more than once in `s`, or the original string `s` if `char` appears once or not at all in `s`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
