Based on the provided problem description, original assessment, and annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. 

The program correctly handles all potential cases:
- When the character appears only once, it removes that single occurrence.
- When the character appears more than once, it removes the first and last occurrences.
- When the character does not appear, it returns the original string.

The annotated code also matches the expected behavior of the program. 

However, it's worth noting that the annotated code assumes the input will be valid, i.e., the string `s` will contain the character `char` at least twice. But the program actually handles cases where `s` contains `char` only once or not at all. 

The reason why the original assessment is accurate is that the function correctly implements the required behavior as described in the problem description, and it correctly handles edge cases.

Final: **True**
