Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- It first finds the index of the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(char)`.
- Then, it finds the index of the last occurrence of the character using `s.rfind(char)`.
- If both occurrences are found (i.e., their indices are not -1), it checks if they are the same index. If they are the same, it means the character appears only once in the string, so it removes one occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
- If the first and last occurrences are at different indices, it removes both occurrences by concatenating the substrings before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding the character at these positions), and after the last occurrence.
- If the character is not found in the string (i.e., `find` or `rfind` returns -1), it simply returns the original string.

This logic handles all potential cases, including:
- The character appears more than once in the string.
- The character appears only once in the string.
- The character does not appear in the string.
- The string is empty.
- The character is at the start or end of the string.

Since all these cases are handled correctly, and the function behaves as described in the problem statement, the correctness of the program is validated.
