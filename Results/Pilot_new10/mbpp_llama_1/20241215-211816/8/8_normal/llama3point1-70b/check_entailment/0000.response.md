Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(s, char)` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- It finds the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(char)`.
- It finds the last occurrence of the character using `s.rfind(char)`.
- If both occurrences are found (i.e., `first_occurrence!= -1` and `last_occurrence!= -1`), it checks if they are the same (i.e., there is only one occurrence of the character).
  - If they are the same, it removes the character using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
  - If they are different, it removes the first and last occurrences by slicing the string: `s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]`.
- If the character is not found, it returns the original string.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:
- When the character appears only once, it removes that single occurrence.
- When the character appears more than once, it removes the first and last occurrences.
- When the character does not appear, it returns the original string.

The function also correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty string or a string containing only the character to be removed. 

Therefore, the function is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
