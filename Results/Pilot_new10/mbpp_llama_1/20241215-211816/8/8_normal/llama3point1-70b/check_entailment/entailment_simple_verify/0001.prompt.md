You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- It first finds the index of the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(char)`.
- Then, it finds the index of the last occurrence of the character using `s.rfind(char)`.
- If both occurrences are found (i.e., their indices are not -1), it checks if they are the same index. If they are the same, it means the character appears only once in the string, so it removes one occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
- If the first and last occurrences are at different indices, it removes both occurrences by concatenating the substrings before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding the character at these positions), and after the last occurrence.
- If the character is not found in the string (i.e., `find` or `rfind` returns -1), it simply returns the original string.

This logic handles all potential cases, including:
- The character appears more than once in the string.
- The character appears only once in the string.
- The character does not appear in the string.
- The string is empty.
- The character is at the start or end of the string.

Since all these cases are handled correctly, and the function behaves as described in the problem statement, the correctness of the program is validated.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and char is a single character that is present at least twice in s.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns a string where the single occurrence of `char` has been removed from `s`.
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a string derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed, where `s` is the original string, and `char` is a character that appears at least twice in `s`.
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns string 's' which contains character 'char' with 'first_occurrence' and 'last_occurrence' being either valid indices of 'char' in 's' or -1 if 'char' is not present in 's' or not present at least twice


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
