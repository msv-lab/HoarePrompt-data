To calculate the output state, we need to consider the initial state and the given Python code. The initial state is: `month` is an integer such that 1 <= `month` <= 12, and `months_with_30_days` is a set containing {4, 6, 9, 11}. The code checks if the `month` is in the `months_with_30_days` set.

Given that `months_with_30_days` = {4, 6, 9, 11}, if `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11, then `month` is in `months_with_30_days`, so the program returns True. For any other value of `month` (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), `month` is not in `months_with_30_days`, so the program returns False.

Output State: **The program returns True if the month is one of the months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), otherwise it returns False**
