The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `month`. According to the code, it checks if the `month` is in the set `months_with_30_days` which includes the months 4, 6, 9, and 11. If the `month` is in this set, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 30 days. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The code does not handle cases where `month` is not an integer or is outside the range of 1 to 12, but based on the given code, it will still return `False` for such cases because it only returns `True` for the specific months listed. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `month` and returns `True` if the month is April, June, September, or November, and `False` otherwise, without explicitly validating if the month is within the range of 1 to 12 or if it's an integer. **
