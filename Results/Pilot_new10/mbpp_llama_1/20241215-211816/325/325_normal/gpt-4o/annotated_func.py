#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
    #The program returns True if the month is one of the months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` and returns `True` if the month is April, June, September, or November, and `False` otherwise, without explicitly validating if the month is within the range of 1 to 12 or if it's an integer.
