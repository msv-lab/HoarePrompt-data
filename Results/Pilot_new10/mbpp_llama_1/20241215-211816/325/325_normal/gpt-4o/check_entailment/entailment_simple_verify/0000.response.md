To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to consider the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code. The problem asks to write a function that checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not, with months represented as numbers from 1 to 12.

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct (**True**). This assessment is based on the fact that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the months with 30 days according to the unit tests provided (for months 6, 2, and 12). The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` containing the month numbers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which are known to have 30 days, and checks if the input month is in this set.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the program's logic, stating that the function returns `True` if the month is one of the months with 30 days and `False` otherwise. This annotation aligns with the original assessment and the problem description.

Given that the program correctly handles all specified test cases and that the months with 30 days are accurately represented in the set `months_with_30_days`, there is no information provided that would suggest the original assessment is inaccurate. The program's logic is straightforward and directly addresses the problem statement without any apparent flaws in its reasoning or implementation.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the strict format required for the response:

Final: **True**
