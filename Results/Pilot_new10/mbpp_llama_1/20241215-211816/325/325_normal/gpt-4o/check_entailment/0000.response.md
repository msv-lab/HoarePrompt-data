Correctness: **True**.

The given function checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. According to the provided unit tests, the function correctly identifies the months with 30 days. 

The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` that includes the month numbers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which are the months that have 30 days. It then checks if the given month is in this set. 

Since the months from 1 to 12 are well-defined and the function correctly handles all the test cases, there is no potential case that the program does not handle as expected. 

In every case, the program will return `True` for the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) and `False` for the months with a different number of days. 

For example, if we call `func_1(4)`, it will return `True` because April has 30 days. Similarly, if we call `func_1(1)`, it will return `False` because January has 31 days. 

Therefore, the given function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
