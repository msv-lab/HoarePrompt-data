Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct as it correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function `func_1` takes a month number as input and checks if it exists in the set `months_with_30_days`, which contains the numbers of months that have 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11). 

This solution assumes that the input will always be a valid month number between 1 and 12, as specified in the problem description. If the input can potentially be outside this range, additional error checking would be needed.

However, based on the problem description and the provided unit tests, the program works as expected. The function correctly returns `True` for months with 30 days and `False` for months with a different number of days. 

It correctly handles all 12 months of the year:
- Months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) return `False` as expected.
- Months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11) return `True` as expected.
- February (2), which has 28 or 29 days depending on the year, returns `False` as expected. 

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided unit tests, the program is correct and should return the expected results for all valid inputs.
