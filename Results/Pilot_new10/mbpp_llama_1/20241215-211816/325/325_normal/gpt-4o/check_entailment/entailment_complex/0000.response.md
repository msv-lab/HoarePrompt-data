Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to check whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. However, the program only checks if the month is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, or November), but it does not consider the months with 31 days or February, which has 28 or 29 days.

A case where the program does not follow the problem description is when the input month is 1 (January), 3 (March), 5 (May), 7 (July), 8 (August), 10 (October), or 12 (December), which all have 31 days. The program should return False for these months, but it only returns True or False based on whether the month is in the set {4, 6, 9, 11}, without considering the actual number of days in the month.

To correctly implement the problem description, the program should return True for the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) and False for the other months. However, the given program does not account for this and only checks for the specific months mentioned earlier.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func_1(month):
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
```
However, a more explicit and correct implementation would also include input validation to ensure the month is an integer between 1 and 12:
```python
def func_1(month):
    if not isinstance(month, int) or month < 1 or month > 12:
        raise ValueError("Month must be an integer between 1 and 12")
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
```
