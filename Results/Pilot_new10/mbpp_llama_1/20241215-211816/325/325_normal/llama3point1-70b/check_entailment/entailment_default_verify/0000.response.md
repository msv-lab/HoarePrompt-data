The original assessment claims that the program is correct because it correctly identifies the months that have 30 days. The function `func_1(month)` checks if the given month number is in the list of months that have 30 days (`thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]`). This list includes the months of April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are the only months with 30 days in a non-leap year.

The output hints provided confirm that the function accepts an integer month and returns True if the month is April, June, September, or November, and False otherwise. This behavior is consistent with the problem description, which asks to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not.

Upon reviewing the code and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment. The program correctly handles all possible month numbers from 1 to 12 and returns the expected results. There are no indications from the output hints that the program fails to work as expected for any valid input.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints.

Final: **True**
