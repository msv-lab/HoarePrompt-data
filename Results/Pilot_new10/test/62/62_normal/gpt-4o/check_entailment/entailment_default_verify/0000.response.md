Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function. It then compares the decimal values of the two numbers and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on their comparison. The output hints also confirm that the program handles various valid test cases correctly, as shown in the examples provided. There are no edge cases or potential scenarios identified where the program might fail to meet the requirements described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
