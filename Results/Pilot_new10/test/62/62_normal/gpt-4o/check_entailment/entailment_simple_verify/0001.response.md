Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function and then compares the decimal values. The function `func_1` accurately handles the conversion process without leading zeros and ensures that all digits are within the valid range for the given base. The comparison logic in the main part of the program is also correct. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.
