Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description and examples provided. The program correctly converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and then compares the decimal values to determine the relationship between the two numbers. The annotations clarify that the function `func_1` accurately performs the base conversion without leading zeros and within the valid digit range, ensuring the overall correctness of the program. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
