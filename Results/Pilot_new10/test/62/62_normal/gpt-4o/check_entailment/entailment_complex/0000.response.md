Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the inputs as specified in the problem description. It first reads the number of digits `n` and the base `b_x` for the first number `X`, followed by the digits themselves. It then does the same for the second number `Y`.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The program uses the `func_1` function to convert each number from its respective base to its decimal representation. The function `func_1` correctly handles the conversion process, ensuring that all digits are within the valid range for the given base and that there are no leading zeros.

3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers to their decimal representations, the program compares them and outputs the appropriate character ('<' if X < Y, '>' if X > Y, and '=' if X = Y).

4. **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted exactly as required by the problem statement, printing a single character based on the comparison result.

Since the program accurately performs all the steps outlined in the problem description and handles all potential cases as specified, it is correct.
