Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal, and compares them. The function `func_1` correctly converts a number from any base to decimal. The main part of the program handles the comparison and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison result. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided code should work for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the program to fail based on the given hints and examples.
