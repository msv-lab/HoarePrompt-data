Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function and then compares the decimal values. The function `func_1` correctly handles the conversion process without leading zeros and ensures that all digits are within the valid range for the given base. The comparison logic is also sound, and the program works for all described cases and potential inputs within the specified range. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
