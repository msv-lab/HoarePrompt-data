Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function. The function `func_1` properly handles the conversion process without leading zeros and ensures that all digits are within the valid range for the given base. The main program then compares the decimal values of the two numbers and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on their comparison. Given the problem description and the examples, this approach ensures that the program works correctly for any valid inputs within the specified constraints. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
