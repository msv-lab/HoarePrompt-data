Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly converts a list of digits representing a number in a given base to its decimal equivalent. The main program then correctly compares these decimal values and prints the appropriate character ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison. The logic implemented in the program matches the problem description and handles all the provided examples correctly. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
