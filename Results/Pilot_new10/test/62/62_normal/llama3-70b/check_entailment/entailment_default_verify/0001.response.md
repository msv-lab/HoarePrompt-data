Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers given in different bases. The program reads the number of digits and the base for each number, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and then compares the resulting decimal values. The program outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison. The examples provided in the output hints match the behavior of the program, and there are no indications that the program fails to handle any valid cases as described. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
