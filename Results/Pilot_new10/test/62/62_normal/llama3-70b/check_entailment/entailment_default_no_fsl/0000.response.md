Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code only works correctly for cases where the lengths of the digit lists (n and m) are the same. However, the problem description specifies that the lengths can be different (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10). If the lengths are different, the current implementation will not handle this case correctly. For instance, if n ≠ m, the code will not compare the numbers properly since it directly converts them without considering the difference in base and digit count.

To fix this, the code needs to handle cases where the lengths of the digit lists are different. One possible approach is to pad the shorter list with zeros on the left until both lists have the same length before converting them to their respective decimal values.
