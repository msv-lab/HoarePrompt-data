Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` converts a number from a given base to its decimal representation. However, the problem requires comparing the numbers in their original bases, not converting them to decimal.

The code compares the decimal representations of `X` and `Y` using the `func_1` function, which means it does not correctly compare the numbers in their original bases. For example:

- In the first sample, the code would convert both numbers to decimal (47 and 47) and return `=`, which is correct for decimal comparison, but not for the original bases.
- In the second sample, the code would convert `X` to decimal (21) and `Y` to decimal (12), returning `<`, which is incorrect because in base 3 and base 5, `X` is actually less than `Y`.
- In the third sample, the code would convert `X` to decimal (65074A16) and `Y` to decimal (34508439), returning `>`, which is incorrect because in base 16 and base 9, `X` is actually greater than `Y`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
