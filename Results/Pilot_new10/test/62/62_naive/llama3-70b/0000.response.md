Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the input bases \(b_x\) and \(b_y\) are the same. According to the problem description, it is specified that \(b_x \neq b_y\). However, the program does not check for this condition and proceeds to convert both numbers to a common base using the `func_1` function, which assumes \(b_x\) and \(b_y\) are different.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 2
3 3
2 1
```

In this case, both numbers are in base 3, and the digits are:
- \(X = 102_3 = 1*3^2 + 0*3^1 + 2*3^0 = 9 + 0 + 2 = 11_{10}\)
- \(Y = 21_3 = 2*3^1 + 1*3^0 = 6 + 1 = 7_{10}\)

Since \(X > Y\), the output should be `>`. However, the program will incorrectly proceed to convert both numbers to a common base (using the first base \(b_x = 3\)) and compare them, potentially leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program should include a check to ensure \(b_x \neq b_y\) before proceeding with the conversion and comparison.
