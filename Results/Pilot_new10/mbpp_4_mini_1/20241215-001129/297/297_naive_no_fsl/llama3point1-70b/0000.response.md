Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of adjacent elements from the input tuple.

- The function uses `zip` to pair each element with its next element in the input tuple.
- The generator expression computes the product for each pair and constructs the output tuple.

There are no edge cases that the function fails to handle:

1. If the input tuple is empty or has one element, the output will naturally be an empty tuple, which conforms to the requirement (N=0 results in an empty output).
2. For tuples of length 2 or more, the function will correctly compute all required products.

Since the implementation meets the problem's requirements for all expected cases without any omissions or failures, the program is correct.
