Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle cases where the elements of the input tuple `t` are non-numeric types, which could lead to a `TypeError`. For instance, if the input tuple is `('a', 2, 3)` or `(1, 2, 'b')`, the function would raise an error since the multiplication operation is not defined for non-numeric types. 

Additionally, the problem description clearly states that the function should return a tuple of length N where each element is the product of adjacent elements in the input tuple. However, if the input tuple contains fewer than two elements (e.g., an empty tuple or a tuple with only one element), although the current implementation handles the one-element case by returning an empty tuple, the program does not explicitly address the requirement that there should be at least two numerical elements according to the output hints.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it fails for non-numeric input cases and does not ensure that the input meets the specified conditions.
