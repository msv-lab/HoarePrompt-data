Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to take a tuple of numbers and return a new tuple where each element is the product of adjacent elements from the input tuple. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where the elements of the tuple are not of a numeric type. If non-numeric elements are present in the input tuple, this will raise a `TypeError`. 

For example, if the input tuple were to contain a string or other non-numeric type, like `func_1((1, 'a', 3))`, the code would fail with a `TypeError`, which is not accounted for in the problem description. Thus, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
