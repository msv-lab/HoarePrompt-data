Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple. 

1. **Input Validation**: If the input tuple has less than two elements, the function will implicitly return an empty tuple due to the behavior of `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, which will yield no pairs for multiplication.
   
2. **Output Structure**: The output is a tuple of length N, as required, since each element in the result corresponds to the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple, effectively reducing the length from N+1 to N.

3. **Correctness Across Examples**: The function handles various scenarios:
   - For an input like `(1, 2, 3)`, the output will be `(1*2, 2*3) => (2, 6)`, consistent with the requirement.
   - An empty tuple `()` or a tuple with a single element `(5,)` will return `()`, which is appropriate given there are no consecutive pairs to process.

The output hints align well with the functionality of the code, confirming that it adheres to the problem requirements for all potential cases. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
