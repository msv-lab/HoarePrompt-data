Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not handle the case when the input tuple contains fewer than 2 elements properly. The problem description states that the function should return a tuple of length N, where N is one less than the length of the input tuple. For instance, given the input `(12,)`, it correctly returns an empty tuple `()`, which is valid. However, if the input tuple contains no elements, like `()`, the code will raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access `t[i + 1]` in the list comprehension `tuple((t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1)))`, as there are no indices to iterate over.

Thus, the program fails to handle all possible edge cases as required by the problem description.
