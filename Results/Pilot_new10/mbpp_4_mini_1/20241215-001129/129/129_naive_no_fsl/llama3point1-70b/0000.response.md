Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input `char` is not a single character. The function is defined to take a string parameter but does not check if the length of the string is exactly one character. For example:

- If the input is `""` (an empty string), the function will raise an `IndexError`.
- If the input is `"ab"` (multiple characters), the function will return the ASCII value of the first character, which does not meet the requirement of returning the ASCII value for a single character.

Thus, the function does not fulfill the specified requirement as it fails for certain edge cases.
