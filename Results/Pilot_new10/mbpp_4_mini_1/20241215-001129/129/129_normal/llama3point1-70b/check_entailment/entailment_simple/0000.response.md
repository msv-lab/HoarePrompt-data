Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, which states that the function must find the ASCII value of a character. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined with a single parameter `char`, which is intended to be a single character string. This matches the requirement that the input must be a character.

2. **Documentation**: The docstring clearly explains what the function does, including the parameter type (string) and the return type (integer). This aligns well with the problem description.

3. **Function Logic**: The function uses the built-in `ord()` function, which correctly returns the ASCII value (or Unicode code point) of the given character. For example, calling `func_1('A')` would return `65`, the ASCII value for 'A'.

4. **Handling Valid Input**: The implementation adheres to the requirement by ensuring it works for any valid single character string as input. 

In summary, the program correctly retrieves the ASCII value of the input character, fulfilling the requirements stated in the problem description.
