Explanation: The code is incorrect as it does not handle various edge cases that could lead to errors. The function `func_1` accepts a single character string and correctly returns its ASCII value using the `ord` function. However, the output hints point out that it does not handle validation or errors when an empty string, a non-single character string, or a non-string type is passed. All those cases would lead to errors. Thus, since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, it is considered incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
