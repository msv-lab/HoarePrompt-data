Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single character string as input and uses the built-in `ord()` function to return the ASCII value. The annotations confirm that the function operates as expected when provided with valid input, which is a single character string. There are no issues with the program based on the description and the annotations, leading to a final conclusion that the program is correct.
