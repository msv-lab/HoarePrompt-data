Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to find the ASCII value of a character. 

Here's how the program fulfills the problem statement:

1. The function `func_1` is defined to take one argument, `char`, which is expected to be a single character string. 
2. Inside the function, it uses the built-in `ord()` function to obtain the ASCII value of the character passed to it.
3. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function correctly returns the ASCII values of 'A', 'R', and 'S', which are 65, 82, and 83, respectively.

Since `ord(char)` correctly converts any single character string to its corresponding ASCII value, the function adheres to the problem description for all valid inputs. 

No scenarios have been presented in the problem description that the function would fail to handle, provided that the input is strictly a single character string. The function does not account for invalid inputs like empty strings or multi-character strings, but the problem description does not specify the expected behavior for such cases, thus the current implementation is suitable under the stated conditions.

Overall, the implementation is accurate and appropriately aligned with the problem requirements.
