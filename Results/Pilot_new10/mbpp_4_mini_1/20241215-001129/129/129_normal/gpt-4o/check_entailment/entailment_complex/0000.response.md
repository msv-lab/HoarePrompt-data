Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the problem description because it doesn't handle cases where the input is not a single character string. According to the annotations, the function `func_1` is expected to take a single character string as input and return its ASCII value. However, if the input is not a single character (for example, an empty string or a string with more than one character), the program could lead to unexpected behavior or errors, such as returning `None` or causing a runtime error.

Therefore, since it does not specify or manage cases where the input does not conform to the expected type or length (a single character string), the program is not correct as per the problem description which assumes valid input.
