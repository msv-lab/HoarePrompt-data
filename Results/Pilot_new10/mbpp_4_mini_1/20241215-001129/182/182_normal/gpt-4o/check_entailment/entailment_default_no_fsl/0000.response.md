Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where any string in the input tuple is empty. According to the output hints, if an empty string is present, an IndexError will occur because the code attempts to access the last character of each string using `s[-1]`, which is not valid for an empty string. For example, if the input is `('', 'foo', 'bar')`, the program will raise an error instead of returning a valid output. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
