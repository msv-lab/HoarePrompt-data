Final: **False**

The original assessment stated the correctness of the program as **True**, but upon analysis, it fails to account for cases where the input tuple may contain empty strings. While the program is expected to work for the provided test cases, it does not handle the edge case of empty strings, which would lead to an `IndexError`. The annotated version emphasizes the assumption that the input is a tuple of strings, but it does not negate the possibility of those strings being empty. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirement over all potential valid inputs. Hence, the original assessment is not accurate.
