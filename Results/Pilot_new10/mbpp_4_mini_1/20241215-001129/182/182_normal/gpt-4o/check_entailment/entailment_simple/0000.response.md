Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character (rear index element) of each string in that tuple. 

Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. The function `func_1(tup)` is defined to take a single argument `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple of strings.
2. It uses a list comprehension that iterates through each string `s` in the tuple `tup`.
3. For each string `s`, it accesses the last character using the index `-1` (i.e., `s[-1]`).
4. The result is a list of these last characters from each string.

The assertions provided in the program also validate that the function behaves as intended for different cases:

- For the tuple `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, the last characters are `['s', 'r', 's']`.
- For the tuple `('Avenge', 'for', 'People')`, the last characters are `['e', 'r', 'e']`.
- For the tuple `('Gotta', 'get', 'go')`, the last characters are `['a', 't', 'o']`.

Since the function performs correctly as per the problem description and satisfies all potential test cases presented in the assertions, we conclude that the program is correct.
