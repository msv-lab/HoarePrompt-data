Final: **False**. 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not handle the case when the input strings are empty. If the input tuple contains any empty string, it will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access the last character of that string. The output hints confirm this issue, stating that an error will occur due to attempting to access an index that does not exist if any string in the tuple is empty. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
