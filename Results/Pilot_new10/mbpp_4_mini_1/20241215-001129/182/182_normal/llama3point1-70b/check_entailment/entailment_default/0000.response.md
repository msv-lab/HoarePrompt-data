The provided program is intended to extract the last character from each string in a tuple. However, upon reviewing the program and the output hints, we can identify a critical flaw in the implementation.

The output hints indicate that if any string in the tuple is empty, the code will raise an `IndexError`. This directly contradicts the requirement of the problem description to extract the last character of each string. If an empty string is provided, attempting to access its last character (i.e., `s[-1]`) will indeed raise an exception.

### Example Case:
- Given the tuple `("", "hello", "world")`, the program would attempt to access the last character of the first element, which is an empty string, leading to an `IndexError`.

Therefore, while the code correctly attempts to achieve the task for non-empty strings, it fails to account for edge cases involving empty strings. 

Correctness: **False**.
