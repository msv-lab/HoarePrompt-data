The program `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in a given tuple of strings according to the problem description. Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a tuple of non-empty strings), the program will work without raising errors. The original assessment noted potential errors (like `IndexError` for empty strings), but based on the defined assumptions of valid input, the function performs as intended.

Thus, the original assessment stating that the program is correct aligns with the annotated version which confirms that the function indeed compiles the last characters appropriately without indicating the need for error handling under the specified valid input condition.

Final: **True**
