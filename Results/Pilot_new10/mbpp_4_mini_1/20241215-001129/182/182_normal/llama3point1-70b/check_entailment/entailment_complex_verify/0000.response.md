The original assessment stated that the program correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple and handled empty strings adequately. However, the annotated version clarifies that if any string in the tuple is empty, the program will raise an `IndexError`. This inconsistency indicates that the program does not handle the case of empty strings gracefully.

Given that the annotated version explicitly states that an empty string will lead to an error, this means that the original assessment regarding the program's correctness is flawed since it fails to address this crucial behavior. Therefore, based on the annotation indicating the potential for an `IndexError`, the original assessment does not hold true.

Final: **False**
