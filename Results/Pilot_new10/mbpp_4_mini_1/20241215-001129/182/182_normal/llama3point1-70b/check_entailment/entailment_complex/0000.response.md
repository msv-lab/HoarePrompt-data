Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for all potential cases. According to the problem description, the function should extract the rear index element (the last character) of each string in the given tuple. However, if any string in the tuple is empty, the program will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the last character of that string.

This means that the program fails to handle the case of empty strings in the tuple, which is a necessary condition for the function to be considered correct based on the requirements. Therefore, since the function does not handle all possible cases as outlined in the problem description, it is incorrect.
