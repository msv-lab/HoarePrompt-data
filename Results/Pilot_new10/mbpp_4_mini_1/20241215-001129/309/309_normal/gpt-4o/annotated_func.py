#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of characters.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string of characters, and `s` is not an empty string.
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, confirming that all characters in the non-empty string 's' are equal to the first character 'first_char'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns True if `s` is empty or if all characters in the non-empty string are the same as the first character; otherwise, it returns False. If the string is empty, it correctly returns True without further checks. If it contains characters that differ from the first one, it will return False.
