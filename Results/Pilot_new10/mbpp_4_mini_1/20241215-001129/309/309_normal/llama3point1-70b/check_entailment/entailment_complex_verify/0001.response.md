The original assessment stated that the function `func_1(s)` correctly determines if all characters in the string `s` are the same, with the reasoning supporting its correctness. 

However, upon reviewing the annotated code, there is a significant error in the understanding of the function's behavior when it comes to empty strings. The function actually returns `False` for an empty string, since the length of the empty set is 0, which does not indicate that all characters are the same, but instead that there are no characters at all.

The original reasoning indicated that an empty string returns `True`, which is incorrect. This contradicts the function's actual behavior and the annotator's claims about it. 

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate. The function does not handle the case of an empty string as implied in the analysis and fails to return `True` for it. 

Final: **False**
