Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to extract elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the code uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) between the elements of the two tuples. This operation does not provide a meaningful way to "extract" elements, and applying it will yield results that depend on the data type of the elements in the tuples.

For example, if we define:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5, 6)
```
The result of calling `func_1(tup1, tup2)` will be:
```python
(1 & 4, 2 & 5, 3 & 6)  # which results in (0, 0, 2)
```

This output does not represent "extracting" elements from the tuples as the problem description suggests. If the tuples contain non-integer types, the program will raise a TypeError as the bitwise operator cannot be applied to them. This indicates that there are cases where the function would not behave as expected according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the solution is incorrect in realizing the intended functionality.
