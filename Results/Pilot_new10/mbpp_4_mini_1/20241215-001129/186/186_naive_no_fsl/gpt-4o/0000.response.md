To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to understand what the function `func_1` is intended to do based on the assertions and the code itself.

The assertions suggest that the function is expected to perform a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples. Let's analyze the provided assertions:

1. For the input tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the expected output is `(0, 0, 2, 1)`:
   - `10 & 5 = 0`
   - `4 & 2 = 0`
   - `6 & 3 = 2`
   - `9 & 3 = 1`

2. For the input tuples `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, the expected output is `(1, 2, 3, 0)`:
   - `1 & 5 = 1`
   - `2 & 6 = 2`
   - `3 & 7 = 3`
   - `4 & 8 = 0`

3. For the input tuples `(8, 9, 11, 12)` and `(7, 13, 14, 17)`, the expected output is `(0, 9, 10, 0)`:
   - `8 & 7 = 0`
   - `9 & 13 = 9`
   - `11 & 14 = 10`
   - `12 & 17 = 0`

Now, examining the implementation of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```
This function zips the two tuples together, performing a bitwise AND on each corresponding pair of elements, and returns the results as a new tuple.

Next, we need to determine if the function accurately corresponds to the expected outputs based on all possible edge cases.

Let's consider potential edge cases:
1. **Empty tuples**:
   - `func_1((), ())` should return `()` since there are no elements to process.
   
2. **Tuples of unequal lengths**:
   - `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`. The function will raise an error since `zip` stops at the shortest length (in this case, 2).
   
3. **Negative integers**:
   - `func_1((-1, -2), (-3, -4))` should perform bitwise AND correctly, but it's not typically covered in the assertions. The results will depend on how Python handles negative integers in binary form.

4. **Large integers**:
   - `func_1((256, 512), (1024, 2048))` should yield `(0, 0)` if correctly handling large numbers.

Since the function does not define behavior for empty tuples or tuples of unequal lengths - it will raise an error in the case of unequal lengths - we conclude that the program does not handle all potential input cases as expected based on the problem description.

Thus, the overall assessment is:

Correctness: **False** 

The function fails for cases like empty tuples or tuples of unequal lengths, where the function is less clear on what to return. For instance, `func_1((), ())` returns `()`, which might not be handled in the provided assertions. Furthermore, `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))` would lead to an error rather than a defined behavior.
