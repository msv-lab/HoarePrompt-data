The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, both of which are tuples. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple that consists of the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples and return a new tuple containing the bitwise AND of the elements at each corresponding position in the input tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters tup1 and tup2, both are tuples, and returns a tuple consisting of the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tup1 and tup2.**
