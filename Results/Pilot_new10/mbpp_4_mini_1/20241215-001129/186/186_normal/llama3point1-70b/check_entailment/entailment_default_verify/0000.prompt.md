You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to extract elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the code uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) between the elements of the two tuples. This operation does not provide a meaningful way to "extract" elements, and applying it will yield results that depend on the data type of the elements in the tuples.

For example, if we define:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5, 6)
```
The result of calling `func_1(tup1, tup2)` will be:
```python
(1 & 4, 2 & 5, 3 & 6)  # which results in (0, 0, 2)
```

This output does not represent "extracting" elements from the tuples as the problem description suggests. If the tuples contain non-integer types, the program will raise a TypeError as the bitwise operator cannot be applied to them. This indicates that there are cases where the function would not behave as expected according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the solution is incorrect in realizing the intended functionality.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are both tuples. It returns a new tuple consisting of the bitwise AND of elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, pairing them based on their index positions. If the tuples are of different lengths, it applies the operation only on corresponding elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
