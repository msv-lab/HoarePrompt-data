The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Both `tuple1` and `tuple2` are tuples containing elements that can be extracted elementwise. The function returns a new tuple that contains the elementwise logical AND of the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and return a tuple representing the elementwise logical AND of their corresponding elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, tuple1 and tuple2, and returns a tuple containing the elementwise logical AND of the corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2.**
