#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples containing elements that can be extracted elementwise.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the elementwise logical AND of the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a tuple containing the elementwise logical AND operation of the corresponding elements from each tuple. If either tuple has fewer elements, the function will only consider the minimum length of the two tuples for the logical AND operation. If the elements within the tuples are not of a compatible type for logical AND operations (such as integers with boolean values), it may lead to unintended results or errors.
