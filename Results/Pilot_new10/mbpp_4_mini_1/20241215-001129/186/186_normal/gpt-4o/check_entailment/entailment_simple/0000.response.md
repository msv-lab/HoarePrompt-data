The provided program is not correct according to the problem description.

The problem description asks for a function to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the program uses a bitwise AND operation (`&`) instead of an elementwise addition or any relevant operation that would be expected based on the description. 

Therefore, the results of the function do not align with the goal of extracting tuples element by element based on the provided input tuples. The test assertions provided also do not yield results that represent the element-wise operation that is expected.

For example:
- The expected tuple from `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` should likely represent some operation based on addition or other forms of extraction that makes sense contextually, but the actual implementation provides a tuple with the results of bitwise AND.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it incorrectly implements a bitwise AND instead of the expected operation to extract elements from the two provided tuples.
