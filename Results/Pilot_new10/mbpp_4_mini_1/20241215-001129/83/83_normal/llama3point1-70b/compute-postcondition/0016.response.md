The code assigns the value of `max_index` to the index of the maximum element found in the `arr` list, restricted to the first `size` elements. Here, since `size` is 1, the maximum value will be derived only from the first element of `arr`. The value of `max_index` will be the index of this first element in `arr`. The states of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared; `max_index` is the index of the first element of `arr`; `n` remains greater than 0; `size` is 1**
