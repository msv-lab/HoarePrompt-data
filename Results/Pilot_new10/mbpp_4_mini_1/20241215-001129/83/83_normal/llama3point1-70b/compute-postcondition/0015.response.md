According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which determines the starting value of `size`. The loop will execute as long as `size` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `size` has been decremented, and therefore it must have been greater than 1 before decrementing (given that `n` is greater than 0). If `size` is now 1 after decrementing, it can still execute one more time before reaching 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `size` was decremented to its current value. For the loop to execute one more time, `size` must be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared; `max_index` is not equal to 0, `n` remains greater than 0, `size` is 1**
