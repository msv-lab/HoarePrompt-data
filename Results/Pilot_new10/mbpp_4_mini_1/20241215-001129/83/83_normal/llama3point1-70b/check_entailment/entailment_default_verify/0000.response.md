Final: **False** 

The original assessment accurately identifies issues with the function, particularly regarding the index retrieval of maximum values and the reversal logic, which leads to incorrect sorting. The output hints imply that the function is capable of sorting various orders of elements and handling edge cases such as an empty list. However, given the identified flaws, it is clear that the function does not sort the list correctly under all scenarios, specifically with duplicates. Hence, the original assessment is justified.
