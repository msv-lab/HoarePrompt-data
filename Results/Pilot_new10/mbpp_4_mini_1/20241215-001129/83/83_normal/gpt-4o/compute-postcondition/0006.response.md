The variable `max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The initial condition states that `n` is greater than 2, `max_index` was previously 0, and `i` is 2. After this assignment, the value of `max_index` will change to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `max_index` is 2, `i` is 2**
