The function `find_max_index` accepts a positive integer `n` indicating the number of elements in a list `arr`. It iterates through the list to find the index of the maximum element, starting the search from index 1, and returns that index. However, it does not handle the case where `arr` is empty or `n` is 0, which would lead to errors or incorrect behavior since the loop would not execute but the function would still return `max_index` initialized to 0. Additionally, if all elements in `arr` are equal, the returned index will always be 0, which may not be intuitive. Therefore, the functionality of the function should also reflect these missing edge cases.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, and returns the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`. It does not handle cases where `arr` is empty or when `n` is 0, potentially leading to incorrect results. If all elements are equal, it will return 0. **
