According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `n - 1`, meaning it will continue executing while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. The next value of `i` will be 3. 

Since `n` is greater than 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3 in order for `i` to remain valid as 3 (which is within the bounds of the loop). The value of `max_index` will remain unchanged at 0 or will be set to 2, depending on the comparison made within the loop itself. However, since the specific comparison isn't provided, we will focus on the conditions guiding the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 3**
