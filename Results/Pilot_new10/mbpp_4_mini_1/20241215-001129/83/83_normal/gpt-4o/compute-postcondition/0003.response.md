The value of `max_index` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables remain valid. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `max_index`. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `max_index` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than the current value of `arr[max_index]`.**
