According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and the loop starts at 1, the condition to ensure that the loop can execute is that `n` must be at least 2. Therefore, `max_index` is 0 and will be the value of `i` at the start of the loop. 

For the loop to be executed, we need to assert that `n` is at least 2, and set `i` to 1, which is the first value in the loop's range.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1**
