Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality stated in the problem description. While the function `func_1` appears to attempt to sort the list, it does so in a manner that only sorts the list in **decreasing order** instead of the requested **increasing order**. 

Here's the breakdown of the issues:

1. **Sorting Order**: The problem description asks for a function that sorts a list of elements, which generally implies sorting in increasing order (from smallest to largest). However, the code uses `find_max_index` to identify the maximum value and then flips the array, which leads to a sorted order from largest to smallest.

2. **Dependent Functions**:
   - The function `find_max_index` is intended to find the index of the maximum value in the list; this approach directly contradicts the typical understanding of sorting. 
   - The function `flip` manipulates the array using a method that reverses sections of the list based on indices but ultimately does not contribute to achieving the desired sorted order (in increasing order).

Thus, while the program may run without errors, it does not produce the expected sorted output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the criteria for correctness.
