Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not satisfy the problem description for several cases. The program is intended to sort a list of elements, but it implements sorting in decreasing order rather than the required increasing order, as evidenced by the output hints for function1. Additionally, the functions rely on a global variable `arr`, which is not defined in local scope, leading to potential errors.

Moreover, the function `find_max_index` does not handle an empty array correctly, which is a critical oversight for a sorting function. If an empty list is passed, `find_max_index` would execute and cause an indexing error due to the absence of any elements in `arr`.

Given these issues, particularly the incorrect sorting order and unhandled empty list case, the overall correctness of the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
