Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the sorting correctly due to several issues:

1. **Global Variable Usage**: The function `find_max_index` uses `arr`, which is not defined as a global variable within its scope. This will lead to a `NameError` when `find_max_index` is called since `arr` is only defined in `func_1`.

2. **Incomplete Sorting Logic**: The algorithm implemented seems to be attempting to use a pancake sorting approach, but it doesn't adequately manage the flip operations. If `arr` is not sorted initially, the flips might not yield the correct sorted order as required. 

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not account for edge cases such as:
   - An empty list: `func_1([])` should return `[]`.
   - A list with a single element: `func_1([5])` should return `[5]`.
   - Cases where elements are repeated, such as `func_1([1, 1, 1])`, should return `[1, 1, 1]`.

To demonstrate a failing test case:
- Running `func_1([3, 1, 2])` could result in incorrect ordering due to the aforementioned issues regarding the undefined `arr` and the incorrect sorting algorithm logic.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
