Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is intended to sort a list of elements, but it has several issues that prevent it from functioning correctly.

1. **Global Variable Usage**: The `find_max_index` function references the variable `arr`, but `arr` is not defined in that function. This will result in a `NameError`. Each function should communicate its dependencies explicitly, especially when arrays or lists are needed.

2. **The `flip` Function**: The `flip` function is meant to reverse a section of the list, but it doesn't take the list itself as a parameter. As a result, it lacks context about which list it is supposed to modify.

3. **Sorting Logic**: The logic implemented in `func_1` seems to follow a pancake sorting approach, where it finds the maximum element in the remaining unsorted portion and flips it to the front, then flips it again to move that maximum to the end. However, due to the issues above, this logic cannot function as intended.

Given these mistakes, the program will not sort the provided lists correctly and will fail to execute entirely. A specific case that fails is the use of `func_1` itself since the required array `arr` is never passed to the functions, causing the program to break. 

Thus, due to these issues, the program does not satisfy the requirements of sorting a list of elements.
