Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly counts the occurrences of all specified elements from the given list in the provided tuple. The function `func_1` implements this by summing the counts of each element listed in `elements` within `tup`. 

The provided test cases confirm its correctness:
1. In the first test case, it counts the occurrences of 'a' (2 times) and 'b' (1 time) in the tuple, resulting in a total of 3.
2. In the second test case, it counts '1' (3 times), '4' (2 times), and '7' (1 time), for a total of 6.
3. In the third test case, it counts '1' (1 time) and '2' (1 time), resulting in a total of 2.

This implementation captures all potential cases based on the problem description and handles both tuples of strings and integers as outlined. Since I can't find any potential case where the program does not meet the requirements, it is deemed correct.
