You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem and the code.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))
```

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. The function takes two arguments: `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple, and `lst`, which is expected to be a list.
2. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function. It iterates over each `element` in `lst`, counts how many times that `element` appears in `tup`, and sums these counts.
3. The program returns the total count of these occurrences.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. **Empty Tuple and List:** If both inputs are empty, the function should return 0. The program handles this correctly since `sum([])` evaluates to 0.
2. **Element Not in Tuple:** If the list contains an element that does not exist in the tuple, `tup.count(element)` will return 0 for that element. This is also handled correctly.
3. **Multiple Occurrences:** If an element appears multiple times in the tuple or the list, the function should correctly tally these occurrences. The implementation accounts for this as well.
4. **Different Data Types:** If elements of the list are of types that do not match those in the tuple (e.g., comparing a string from `lst` with an integer in `tup`), the count will be 0, which is also expected behavior.
5. **Duplicate Elements in List:** If the list has duplicate elements, the function will count the occurrences multiple times, which aligns with the problem description.

Considering all the above points, the function correctly implements the required functionality and handles edge cases as anticipated.

Correctness: **True**

The explanation is that the program accurately counts the occurrences of all elements of the list in the tuple for all the cases examined, and there are no edge cases left unhandled.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the total count of how many times each element in `lst` appears in `tup`. If an element from `lst` is not found in `tup`, it contributes a count of zero to the sum. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
