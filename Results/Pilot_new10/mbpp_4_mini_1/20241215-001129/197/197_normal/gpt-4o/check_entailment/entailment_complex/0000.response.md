Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, counting how many times each element from the list appears in the tuple. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Input Types**: The function accepts two types of data structures: a tuple (`tup`) and a list (`elements`), which align perfectly with the requirements of counting occurrences of elements in a tuple.

2. **Counting Logic**: The counting is done correctly using a generator expression within the `sum()` function. It iterates over each element in the list and uses the `count()` method of the tuple to tally how many times that element appears.

3. **Handling of Non-existing Elements**: If any element from the list is not found in the tuple, the `count()` method will return `0`, which means it does not affect the overall sum. This is in accordance with the problem description.

4. **Accurate Returns**: The function returns the total count of occurrences as a single integer, which is what the problem requires.

The assertions provided further validate that the function behaves correctly for specific inputs, supporting the correctness of the program based on different scenarios. Thus, the program meets all conditions described in the problem statement.
