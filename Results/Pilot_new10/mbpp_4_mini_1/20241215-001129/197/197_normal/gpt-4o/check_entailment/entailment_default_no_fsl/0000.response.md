Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements a function `func_1` which counts the total occurrences of specified elements from a list within a tuple. 

Here's the explanation:

1. **Description Matching**: The problem description states that the function should count how many times the elements from the list appear in the tuple. The implementation achieves this by iterating over each element in the list and using the tuple's `count()` method to sum the occurrences.

2. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the program serve as examples and confirm its expected behavior:
   - For the tuple `('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd')` and the list `['a', 'b']`, the function returns `3` since `'a'` appears `2` times and `'b'` appears `1` time.
   - For the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4)` with the list `[1, 4, 7]`, the function returns `6` since `1` appears `3` times, `4` appears `2` times, and `7` appears `1` time.
   - For the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)` with the list `[1, 2]`, the function returns `2`, as `1` and `2` each appear `1` time.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The function handles the case of elements not found in the tuple by simply not including them in the sum calculation, as illustrated by the behavior of the `count()` method which returns `0` for non-existing items, thus not affecting the overall count.

Since all tested cases align with the stated requirements and the implementation correctly captures every potential case mentioned, it is concluded that the code is correct.
