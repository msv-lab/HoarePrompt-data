Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list of `elements`, and returns the count of how many times elements from the list appear in the tuple. If an element in `elements` is not found in `tup`, it does not contribute to the count, leading to a total count based solely on the occurrences of the elements in the tuple.**
