Correctness: **True**. 

The provided function correctly computes the n-th Lucas number according to the definitions of the sequence. The logic handles the base cases (`L(0) = 2` and `L(1) = 1`) correctly and uses a loop to compute subsequent values for `n >= 2`. The iterative approach with the tuple unpacking for `(a, b)` ensures that the function efficiently calculates the Lucas numbers without unnecessary recursion. Therefore, the function behaves as expected for all values of `n` that fit the standard definition of Lucas numbers.
