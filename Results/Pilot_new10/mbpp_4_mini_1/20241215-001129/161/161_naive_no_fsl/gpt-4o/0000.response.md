To assess the correctness of the provided program that computes the nth Lucas number, let's analyze it step by step based on the problem description and the examples provided.

The definitions for the Lucas numbers are:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The given program implements these rules in the function `func_1` as follows:
- If `n` is 0, it returns 2.
- If `n` is 1, it returns 1.
- For other values of `n`, it calculates the Lucas number iteratively.

The assertions in the program check:
- `func_1(9)` should return 76
- `func_1(4)` should return 7
- `func_1(3)` should return 4

Now let's compute the expected values for these assertions:
- L(9) = L(8) + L(7) = 47 + 29 = 76 (Correct)
- L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7 (Correct)
- L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4 (Correct)

All calculations check out.

Next, we should also consider edge cases:
- For `n = 2`, we should calculate manually: L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3 (The program does not assert this case, but should return 3.)
- For negative values of `n`, the function does not handle these cases, potentially leading to incorrect or unpredictable results.

Since the program currently lacks handling for negative integers and does not provide correct results for those cases, it does not fulfill the problem description adequately for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
