Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number, but the implementation of the function `func_1` mistakenly computes Fibonacci numbers instead. In the provided code:

- The Lucas sequence starts with `L(0) = 2` and `L(1) = 1`, which is correct.
- For `n >= 2`, however, it should compute `L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)` instead, where the terms in the Lucas sequence should be calculated based on the two preceding Lucas numbers.

The issue arises in the variable assignments within the loop. Specifically, `a` and `b` are not being updated correctly to represent the Lucas numbers; rather, the logic mimics the Fibonacci sequence.

Here is a counterexample:

- The 2nd Lucas number should be `L(2) = L(0) + L(1) = 2 + 1 = 3`. 
- The function, by the current logic, will calculate `L(2)` as `1 + 2 = 3` (returns 1, which is incorrect since `1` is the first Lucas number and it mistakenly provides the Fibonacci value).

Thus, there is an inconsistency in the function's behavior concerning the problem's requirements. Hence, the final assessment is that the program does not fulfill the task as required.
