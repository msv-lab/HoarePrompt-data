According to the code, the loop iterates with `_` starting from 2 up to and including `n`. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, and `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be incremented to 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4; `_` is 4; `a` is `b_prev`; `b` is `a_prev + b_prev`**
