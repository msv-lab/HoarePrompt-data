Correctness: **False**

The provided program claims to return the nth Lucas number, but it actually calculates the nth Fibonacci number for n greater than 1. The Lucas sequence starts with values 2 and 1 (L0=2, L1=1), and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones, similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different starting values. 

For instance:
- For n=2, the correct Lucas number is 3 (L2=2+1=3), but the program incorrectly returns 1 (it calculates Fibonacci for n=2).
- For n=3, the correct Lucas number is 4 (L3=1+3=4), but it incorrectly computes Fibonacci for n=3.

Thus, because the function does not adhere to the definition of the Lucas numbers for all inputs, the program is incorrect.
