Correctness: **False**

The provided program incorrectly computes the Lucas numbers. According to the problem description, the function must return the n-th Lucas number.

The Lucas numbers are defined by the following recurrence relation:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The key point of error in the annotated program is that it computes Fibonacci numbers instead of Lucas numbers. Specifically:
- The sequence defined in the program starts with the values `a = 2` (which corresponds to L(0)) and `b = 1` (which corresponds to L(1)). However, in the loop, `b` is updated using the Fibonacci addition of the two previous numbers, which results in a sequence that does not match the mathematical definition of Lucas numbers for values of `n` greater than 1.

For example:
- For n = 2, the program returns 1, but the correct Lucas number is 3.
- This pattern continues, leading to incorrect results for all `n > 2`.

Thus, the function fails to compute the correct n-th Lucas number according to the given definition.
