The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where `n` is negative, as the Lucas numbers are defined only for non-negative integers. However, the annotated version of the code clarifies that it is assumed the input will always be a non-negative integer. Given this assumption, the program behaves correctly according to the definition of Lucas numbers: returning 2 for `n = 0`, 1 for `n = 1`, and calculating the subsequent numbers correctly for `n > 1`.

The assertions in the program also confirm that for valid non-negative inputs, the function returns the correct Lucas numbers.

Thus, since the annotations and the assumptions about input validity demonstrate that the program is indeed correctly calculating the n-th Lucas number, I conclude that the original assessment was not accurate.

Final: **True**.
