The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when `n` is less than 0. It emphasized that Lucas numbers are defined only for non-negative integers, and thus any behavior produced by a negative input is invalid.

However, the output hints specify that the function is designed to accept a non-negative integer `n` and that it works correctly for such inputs. The hints do not indicate that the function handles or is expected to handle negative integers.

Since the hints confirm that the function is expected to operate only with non-negative integers and since the function correctly computes the n-th Lucas number for valid non-negative inputs, the original assessment does not accurately reflect the actual functionality of the program.

Given this reasoning, I conclude that the program satisfies the requirements for the problem description when considering only valid input (non-negative integers). As such, the original assessment should be revised.

Final: **True**
