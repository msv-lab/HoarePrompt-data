The provided program has the function `func_1`, which is intended to compute the n-th Lucas number. However, upon careful review of the logic implemented within the function, it becomes evident that the function actually computes the n-th Fibonacci number instead.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Lucas Numbers Definition**: The Lucas numbers are defined as:
   - \( L(0) = 2 \)
   - \( L(1) = 1 \)
   - For \( n \geq 2 \): \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \)

2. **Fibonacci Sequence Logic in Program**: The program is using a typical Fibonacci generation approach:
   - The initial variables used (2, 1) correspond to \( L(0) \) and \( L(1) \). However, the loop computes the Fibonacci-like sequence which is not correct for the Lucas numbers. 

3. **Return Value Misalignment**: The body of the for-loop ultimately produces the n-th Fibonacci number, rather than the n-th Lucas number. The transition:
   ```python
   a, b = b, a + b
   ```
   contradicts the requirement since it does not accurately follow the Lucas number recurrence relation beyond the initial values.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the function to calculate the n-th Lucas number as described in the problem statement. The use of Fibonacci logic instead of the required Lucas logic means that the function will yield incorrect results for any n greater than 1.

Correctness: **False**
