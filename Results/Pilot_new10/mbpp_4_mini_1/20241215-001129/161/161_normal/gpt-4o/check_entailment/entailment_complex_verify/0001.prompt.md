You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program that computes the nth Lucas number, let's analyze it step by step based on the problem description and the examples provided.

The definitions for the Lucas numbers are:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The given program implements these rules in the function `func_1` as follows:
- If `n` is 0, it returns 2.
- If `n` is 1, it returns 1.
- For other values of `n`, it calculates the Lucas number iteratively.

The assertions in the program check:
- `func_1(9)` should return 76
- `func_1(4)` should return 7
- `func_1(3)` should return 4

Now let's compute the expected values for these assertions:
- L(9) = L(8) + L(7) = 47 + 29 = 76 (Correct)
- L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7 (Correct)
- L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4 (Correct)

All calculations check out.

Next, we should also consider edge cases:
- For `n = 2`, we should calculate manually: L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3 (The program does not assert this case, but should return 3.)
- For negative values of `n`, the function does not handle these cases, potentially leading to incorrect or unpredictable results.

Since the program currently lacks handling for negative integers and does not provide correct results for those cases, it does not fulfill the problem description adequately for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns the integer 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `a` is the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number starting from (2, 1), `b` is the n-th Fibonacci number starting from (2, 1).
            return b
            #The program returns the n-th Fibonacci number 'b' starting from the sequence (2, 1), where n is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 2 if `n` is 0, 1 if `n` is 1, and the n-th Fibonacci number starting from the sequence (2, 1) for `n` greater than 1. The Fibonacci sequence generated begins with 2 and 1 instead of the typical 0 and 1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
