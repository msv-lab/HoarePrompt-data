To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we note the behavior of the code based on the loop's structure. 

The loop iteratively updates the values of `a` and `b`. The initial values are:
- `a` starts at 2,
- `b` starts at 1.

For each iteration in the loop:
1. The value of `a` becomes the previous value of `b`.
2. The value of `b` becomes the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`.

The loop will execute for `n - 1` iterations since it starts at 2 and goes to `n`.

We can further analyze the values through iterations:
- After 1 execution: 
  - `a` is now 1 (the original value of `b`).
  - `b` is now 3 (2 + 1).

- After 2 executions:
  - `a` is now 3 (the original value of `b`).
  - `b` is now 4 (the sum of original `a` (2) and `b` (1) gives 3; then summed with the previous `b` which was 3).

- After 3 executions:
  - `a` is now 4 (the original `b`).
  - `b` is now 7 (the sum of previous `a` (3) and `b` (4)).

The pattern that emerges indicates that after `n - 1` executions:
- `a` will eventually be the value of `b` from the previous iteration.
- `b` will be the Fibonacci-like sum derived from the two previous values being summed up iteratively.

In conclusion:
- After `n - 1` iterations, the final state of `a` will be the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number starting with the sequence initiated by the initial values of 2 and 1.
- The final value of `b` will be the (n)-th Fibonacci number since we will have iterated `n - 1` times starting from `b = 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `a` is the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number starting from (2, 1), `b` is the n-th Fibonacci number starting from (2, 1).**
