Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2; a is assigned the value of b (which is 2), b is assigned the value of (a + b) before the assignment (which is unknown as `a` was not defined prior to this line). Therefore, a is 2 and b is the value of `a` before this execution plus 2. If we denote the original value of `a` as `a_`, then the new value of `b` is `a_ + 2`.**
