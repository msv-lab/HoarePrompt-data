According to the code, the loop will execute for a range from 2 to `n + 1`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. 

The initial state shows that `n` is greater than 1, which is sufficient for the loop to run. The loop will start iterating with the first value being 2, as indicated by the range. 

At the start of the loop, `_` will take on the values starting from 2 up to (but not including) `n + 1`, and thus will depend on the value of `n`. Since `n` is greater than 1, the first value would be 2.

Thus, the loop will execute given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2**
