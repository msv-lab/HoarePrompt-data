To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we first dissect the requirements and the code.

### Problem Description
The task requires checking whether a list contains consecutive numbers. 

- Consecutive numbers are defined as numbers that follow one another with no gaps, e.g., [1, 2, 3] or [4, 5, 6, 7].
- If the list contains duplicates or non-consecutive numbers (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 5]), or if it is not sorted, it should not be considered as containing consecutive numbers.

### The Program
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

1. **Sorting the list**: The function begins by sorting the input list.
2. **Checking for consecutive numbers**: 
   - It uses a generator expression to check if every pair of adjacent sorted elements has a difference of exactly 1.
3. **Checking for duplicates**: 
   - It checks that the length of the list is the same as the length of the set of the list (which removes duplicates).

### Considerations
Let's consider cases where the function might not work as expected:

1. **Empty list**: The function returns `True`, because there are no elements to check, but an empty list should be considered as not containing consecutive numbers.
2. **Single element list**: For a list like `[3]`, it returns `True` since there are no pairs to check, yet a single number does not satisfy the requirement for consecutive numbers.
3. **Non-integer elements**: The function does not handle lists with non-integer entries. For instance, for a list like `[1, 2, '3']`, the sort will still work, but the comparison will raise a `TypeError`.
4. **Negatives**: The current implementation assumes positive consecutive integers. For a list like `[-1, 0, 1]`, it would work but if the assumption is only for positive integers, then it would be incorrect.

### Conclusion
Based on the above analysis, I can conclude that:

- The function does not handle the empty list correctly.
- The function does not handle single-element lists correctly.
- The function would fail on lists containing non-integer values.

Since we found at least one case where the function may not work correctly (the empty list case), we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
