To determine the correctness of the given program `func_1`, let's analyze the code in the context of the problem description: checking whether a list contains consecutive numbers.

From the provided program:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True
```

1. **Handling empty lists**: The function correctly returns `False` for an empty list, which aligns with the problem description (as there are no consecutive numbers).

2. **Sorting the list**: The function sorts the list, which is necessary to check for consecutive numbers since they need to be in order.

3. **Checking for consecutive numbers**: The for loop checks each pair of adjacent numbers in the sorted list. If any two numbers are not consecutive (i.e., the difference is not equal to 1), it returns `False`.

4. **Final true return**: If all pairs of numbers are consecutive, it returns `True`.

Now let's consider edge cases:

- Input with duplicates, such as `[1, 1, 2, 3]`: The sorted version is `[1, 1, 2, 3]`, and the check will yield `True`, which may not align with the interpretation of "consecutive numbers," since duplicates typically do not count as making a series of consecutive numbers.
  
- Input with a negative number, such as `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]`: This returns `False` since the check would fail at `[-3, -2]`.

- Input with only a single number, such as `[5]`: The sorted version would be `[5]`, and the function would return `True`. However, since there are no pairs to compare, we cannot consider a single number to fulfill the definition of having consecutive numbers.

- Input with a mix of consecutive and non-consecutive numbers like `[5, 6, 7, 9]`: This will also return `False` as it should.

Given these considerations, the function does not correctly assess situations with duplicate numbers and potentially misinterprets single-member lists as having consecutive numbers. Therefore, only checking for gaps in sequences without considering counts results in a program that is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**. 

One clear case where it doesn't work correctly is with duplicates â€“ for example, `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3])` should ideally return `False` because the list contains duplicates and thus shouldn't qualify as containing consecutive distinct numbers.
