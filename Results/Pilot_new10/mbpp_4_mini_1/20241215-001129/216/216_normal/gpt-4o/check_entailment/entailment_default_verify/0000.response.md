The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` was incorrect due to its handling of duplicates and single-element lists. Based on the output hints provided, the function correctly identifies whether a given list contains a sequence of consecutive integers, returning `False` for empty lists and for lists that do not consist of consecutive numbers.

The reasoning behind the original assessment:
1. It identifies correctly that duplicates should not count as consecutive numbers. In this context, any list with duplicates would not fulfill the requirement of being consecutive in a strict sense.
2. It considered single-element lists as somewhat ambiguous, suggesting they might not fulfill the definition of "consecutive numbers."

However, the output hints clarify that the function only checks for the sequence of integers being consecutive after sorting, effectively rendering unique integers in the list. Since the problem description and output hints suggest that the function is designed to check for consecutive integers, and since duplicates do not form a consecutive sequence, the assessment of the program being incorrect based solely on this aspect is not entirely accurate.

Given no additional constraints on what constitutes a valid list for assessing "consecutive" and accepting handling of duplicates as a valid implementation to return `False`, the output hints affirm that the original assessment was too reductive and overlooked the function's capability to handle lists as described.

Thus, upon concisely enforcing the program against the problem description, the program does indeed correctly check for consecutive numbers, provided that we interpret the requirement of "consecutive integers" as allowing for duplicates to simply lead to a `False` output when they are present.

Final: **True**
