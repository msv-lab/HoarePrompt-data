You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program `func_1`, let's analyze the code in the context of the problem description: checking whether a list contains consecutive numbers.

From the provided program:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True
```

1. **Handling empty lists**: The function correctly returns `False` for an empty list, which aligns with the problem description (as there are no consecutive numbers).

2. **Sorting the list**: The function sorts the list, which is necessary to check for consecutive numbers since they need to be in order.

3. **Checking for consecutive numbers**: The for loop checks each pair of adjacent numbers in the sorted list. If any two numbers are not consecutive (i.e., the difference is not equal to 1), it returns `False`.

4. **Final true return**: If all pairs of numbers are consecutive, it returns `True`.

Now let's consider edge cases:

- Input with duplicates, such as `[1, 1, 2, 3]`: The sorted version is `[1, 1, 2, 3]`, and the check will yield `True`, which may not align with the interpretation of "consecutive numbers," since duplicates typically do not count as making a series of consecutive numbers.
  
- Input with a negative number, such as `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]`: This returns `False` since the check would fail at `[-3, -2]`.

- Input with only a single number, such as `[5]`: The sorted version would be `[5]`, and the function would return `True`. However, since there are no pairs to compare, we cannot consider a single number to fulfill the definition of having consecutive numbers.

- Input with a mix of consecutive and non-consecutive numbers like `[5, 6, 7, 9]`: This will also return `False` as it should.

Given these considerations, the function does not correctly assess situations with duplicate numbers and potentially misinterprets single-member lists as having consecutive numbers. Therefore, only checking for gaps in sequences without considering counts results in a program that is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**. 

One clear case where it doesn't work correctly is with duplicates â€“ for example, `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3])` should ideally return `False` because the list contains duplicates and thus shouldn't qualify as containing consecutive distinct numbers.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers and returns False if the list is empty or if the sorted version of the list does not consist of consecutive integers. If the list is non-empty and all integers form a consecutive sequence, it returns True. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
