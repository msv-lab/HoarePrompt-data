The original assessment accurately identifies that the function `func_1` does not correctly handle certain edge cases, particularly with lists containing duplicate numbers. The assessment highlighted that the function erroneously returns `True` for inputs like `[1, 1, 2, 3]`, which should return `False` as duplicates do not satisfy the requirement for distinct consecutive integers. 

The annotated version of the program confirms that the function checks for the condition of being non-empty and sorts the list before checking for consecutive integers. However, it fails to account for duplicates, leading to incorrect conclusions in some cases. The annotation also underscores the function's logic but does not resolve the issues identified in the original assessment regarding the treatment of duplicates and single elements.

Thus, based on the problem description and evaluation of both the original assessment and the annotated code, the conclusion remains that the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
