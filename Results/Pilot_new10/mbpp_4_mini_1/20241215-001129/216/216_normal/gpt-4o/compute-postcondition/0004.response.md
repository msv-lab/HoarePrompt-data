According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `lst_sorted`. The loop will execute as long as the length of `lst_sorted` is greater than 1, since `range(len(lst_sorted) - 1)` needs at least one valid index to iterate over. Given that `lst` is a non-empty list, `lst_sorted` will also be non-empty. 

However, we also need to ensure that `len(lst_sorted) - 1` is non-negative, which requires `len(lst_sorted)` to be at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `lst_sorted` must contain at least 2 elements at the start of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, the index `i` will have taken on values from 0 to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`, with the last value being `len(lst_sorted) - 2`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
