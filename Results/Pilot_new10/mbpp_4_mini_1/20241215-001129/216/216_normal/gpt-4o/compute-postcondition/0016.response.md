The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function performs checks on `lst` and returns different values based on these checks. 

- If `lst` is empty, the function returns `False` (Case 1).
- If the difference between the second element and the first element of the sorted version of `lst` is not equal to 1, the function returns `False` (Case 2).
- There are additional cases (Case 3 and Case 4) where the function returns `False` as well.
- If `lst` is not empty and its sorted version forms a consecutive sequence, the function returns `True` (Case 5).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and determine if it is empty or forms a consecutive sequence, returning `True` if it does, and `False` for other cases including if the list is empty or does not meet the consecutive sequence criteria. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst (a list of integers) and returns False if lst is empty or does not form a consecutive sequence; otherwise, it returns True.**
