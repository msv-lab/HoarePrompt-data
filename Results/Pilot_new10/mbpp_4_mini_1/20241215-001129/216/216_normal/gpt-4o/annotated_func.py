#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the list `lst` is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty.

        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`, and all elements in `lst_sorted` form a consecutive sequence.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list 'lst' is not empty and its sorted version 'lst_sorted' forms a consecutive sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns False if the list is empty or if the sorted version of the list does not consist of consecutive integers. If the list is non-empty and all integers form a consecutive sequence, it returns True.
