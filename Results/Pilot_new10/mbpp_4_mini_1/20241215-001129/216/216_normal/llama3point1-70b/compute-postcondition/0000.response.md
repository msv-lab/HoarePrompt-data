The `lst.sort()` method rearranges the elements of the list `lst` in ascending order. The values of the elements in `lst` are changed, but the other details about the list are preserved. Since we don't have the specific values of `lst`, we just indicate that it is now sorted.

Output State: **`lst` is a sorted list of integers.**
