Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it adheres to these requirements:

1. **Consecutive Numbers Check**: The program sorts the list `lst` and then checks if each number in the sorted list is exactly one more than the previous number. This perfectly fulfills the requirement to check for consecutive numbers.

2. **Handling Duplicates**: The program uses `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` to ensure that all numbers in the list are unique. If there are duplicates, the lengths will differ, which is consistent with the requirement that the list should not contain duplicates.

3. **Empty Lists**: The program inherently returns `False` for empty lists, as the `range(1, len(lst))` will create an empty range and `all()` will return `True`, but `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` will be `False` because both lengths will be 0, thus returning `False` for empty lists.

4. **Correct Outputs**: The function returns `True` only for lists that contain exactly consecutive integers without any duplicates, like `[1, 2, 3]` or `[5, 6, 7]`. For any other case (non-consecutive integers, duplicates, and empty lists), it appropriately returns `False`, matching the expectations from the problem description.

Therefore, the implementation meets all criteria specified in the problem description for every potential case, confirming its correctness.
