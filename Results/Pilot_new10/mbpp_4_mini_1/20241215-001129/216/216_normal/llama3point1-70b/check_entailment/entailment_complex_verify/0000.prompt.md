You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program attempts to check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers by first sorting the list and then checking if each adjacent pair of numbers has a difference of exactly 1. However, there is a potential case where the logic fails:

1. The program assumes that the list can only contain positive integers. For instance, if the input list is `[2, 3, 4, 5]`, it correctly identifies the sequence as consecutive.
2. However, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, it also returns `True` as expected.
3. However, if the input list is `[1, 2, 4]`, the logic here would also fail because it should check for pairs that include all numbers within the given range (1 to 4 in this case).
4. Similarly, an empty list `[]` or a list with a single element (like `[5]`) would incorrectly return `False` instead of considering that by default, these can be interpreted as not having any non-consecutiveness issues.

Thus, cases with gaps in the sequence or with 0 or negative numbers are not correctly handled by the program, leading to incorrect return values. So, the program does not correctly identify whether a given list contains consecutive numbers for all potential scenarios.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the sorted list 'lst' contains consecutive integers without duplicates; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns True if the list contains exactly consecutive integers (e.g., [1, 2, 3] or [5, 6, 7]) without any duplicates, and False otherwise. The function also returns False for empty lists and lists that are not sorted consecutively by one. Additionally, if the list contains duplicate integers or non-consecutive integers, the return value will also be False.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
