Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as described in the problem statement, and the provided test cases confirm its functionality. The annotated version supports this by stating that the function returns a tuple containing all elements from the list 'lst', which can be of any data type. Given the assumptions about input validity, the function meets the requirements of the problem description effectively.
