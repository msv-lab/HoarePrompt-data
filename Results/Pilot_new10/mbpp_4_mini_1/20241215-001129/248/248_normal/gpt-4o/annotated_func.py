#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of any data type.
def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)
    #The program returns a tuple containing all the elements from the list 'lst', which can be of any data type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` containing elements of any data type and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. There are no conditions or exceptions, and it will operate as long as `lst` is provided. If `lst` is empty, the function will return an empty tuple.
