Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single argument, `input_list`, which is expected to be a list of elements. By using the `tuple()` constructor, the program effectively converts the provided list into a tuple. 

This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirements of the problem description, which specifically states that the function must convert a list to a tuple. The program does not impose any constraints on the content of the list, meaning it can handle any type of elements that can be part of a tuple (e.g., integers, strings, other lists, etc.). 

Every time the function is called with a list, it will return the corresponding tuple representation of that list without any error or unintended behavior. Thus, it meets the problem requirements for all potential input cases, confirming its correctness.
