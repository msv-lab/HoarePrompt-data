#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list of elements.
def func_1(input_list):
    return tuple(input_list)
    #The program returns a tuple created from the list 'input_list'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `input_list` and returns a tuple containing the elements of that list. It does not handle cases where the input is not a list, but it will convert any iterable that can be passed to `tuple()`, resulting in a tuple of its elements. If `input_list` is empty, the function returns an empty tuple.
