The function accepts a list `input_list` and returns a tuple containing the elements of that list. It does not handle cases where the input is not a list, but it will convert any iterable that can be passed to `tuple()`, resulting in a tuple of its elements. If `input_list` is empty, the function returns an empty tuple.
