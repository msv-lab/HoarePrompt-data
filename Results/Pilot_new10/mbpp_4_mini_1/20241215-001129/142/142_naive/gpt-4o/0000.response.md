Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element by iterating through each item in the list. It returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the specified element. If all items are equal, it will return `True`. 

The provided test cases confirm that:
1. For `func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue')`, it returns `False`, which is correct as not all items are equal to 'blue'.
2. For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7)`, it returns `False`, which is also correct.
3. For `func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green')`, it correctly returns `True`, since all items are indeed equal to 'green'.

Since all potential cases I can think of work as expected according to the problem description, the code is correct.
