Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. It uses the `all()` function alongside a generator expression to check if every item in the list `lst` is equal to the specified `element`. 

The program will return `True` if:
1. The list is empty (`lst = []`), as there are no elements that are not equal to `element`.
2. All items in the list are equal to `element`.
3. The list contains only one item that is equal to `element`.

It will return `False` if:
1. At least one item in the list is not equal to `element`.
2. The list is of any length greater than zero, and at least one item fails the equality check.

Given these conditions, the implementation fulfills the requirement of verifying whether all items in the list are equal to the given element for every potential case that can arise. Thus, there are no found cases where the program does not function as specified.
