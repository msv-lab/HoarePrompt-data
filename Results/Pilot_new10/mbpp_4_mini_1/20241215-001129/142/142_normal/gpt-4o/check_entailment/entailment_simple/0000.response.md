Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(lst, element)` checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. Here's how it fulfills the problem description:

1. The function iterates through each item in the list `lst`.
2. If any item does not match `element`, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all items are equal to the specified element.
3. If the loop completes without finding any discrepancies (i.e., all items are equal to `element`), the function returns `True`.

The assertions given demonstrate the function's correctness in various scenarios:

- In the first assertion, the list contains items that are not equal to 'blue', and the function correctly returns `False`.
- In the second assertion, the numbers in the list are different from 7, and the function again returns `False`.
- In the third assertion, since every item in the list is 'green', the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the function `func_1` meets the specifications of the problem description for all tested cases and handles any potential case correctly, confirming its correctness.
