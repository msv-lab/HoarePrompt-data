You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. If the list is empty, the function should ideally return `True`, since there are no items that contradict the condition of being equal to the given element. However, the provided function will return `True` if the list is not empty and all elements are equal to the given element but does not handle the empty list case correctly, as there is no check for this situation. 

For example, if we call `func_1([], 'anything')`, it will return `True`, which is correct according to common interpretations of "all items are equal". However, since the implementation does not explicitly handle this case or return a specific response for it, it may lead to confusion in understanding whether the implementation is following the problem description.

Thus, the program fails to satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`. It checks if all items in the list are equal to `element`. If all items match, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. If the list is empty, the function will return True, as there are no items to contradict the condition. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
