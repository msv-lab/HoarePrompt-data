The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is correct. However, the output hints indicate that if the list is empty, the function will return `True`. According to the problem description, there is no specification regarding how to handle an empty list. It can be argued that since the task is to check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element, returning `True` for an empty list may be counterintuitive, as there are no items to compare with the `element`.

With this in mind, while the program works correctly for non-empty lists as tested in the assertions, there is a potential oversight in handling the edge case of an empty list which hasn't been explicitly tested. Hence, based on the problem description, the handling of an empty list does not align with common expectations of checking equality across a list. 

Therefore, the correct assessment should conclude that the program is not entirely correct.

Final: **False**.
