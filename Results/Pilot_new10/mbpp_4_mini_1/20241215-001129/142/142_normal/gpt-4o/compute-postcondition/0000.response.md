According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If the list has at least 1 item, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `element` being of any type does not affect whether the loop can run. So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 item, and `item` should be set to the first item in the list. 

State: **`lst` is a list of items that must have at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in `lst`**
