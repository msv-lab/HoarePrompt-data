#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of items and element is a value of the same type as the items in lst.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns True if all items in the list 'lst' are equal to 'element', otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`, returning True if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`; otherwise, it returns False. It handles edge cases such as an empty list, where it returns True, since vacuously all elements (none in this case) are equal to `element`.
