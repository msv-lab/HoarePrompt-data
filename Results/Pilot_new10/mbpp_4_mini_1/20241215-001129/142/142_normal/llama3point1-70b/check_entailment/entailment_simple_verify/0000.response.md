Final: **True**. 

The original assessment accurately states that the function `func_1(lst, element)` correctly checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The annotations confirm that the function's behavior matches the problem description. Specifically, it correctly returns `True` for an empty list, can handle lists with one item, and checks all items when there are multiple, stopping at the first non-matching item. All provided information supports that the function meets the requirements of the problem description, and there are no scenarios in which this function would fail.
