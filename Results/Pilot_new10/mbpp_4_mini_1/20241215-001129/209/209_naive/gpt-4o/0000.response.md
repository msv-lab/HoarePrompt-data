To analyze the program against the provided problem description, we need to verify if the implementation correctly retrieves the first element of each sublist from a list of lists. 

The given implementation is as follows:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```

By looking at the implementation, we notice that it retrieves the first element of each sublist using list comprehension. However, we need to consider potential edge cases that could cause this program to fail:

1. **Empty Sublists:** If any of the sublists are empty, trying to access `sublist[0]` would raise an `IndexError`.
2. **Empty Outer List:** If the main list is empty, the output would be `[]`, which is correct but needs to be consistent with expectations for the problem statement.

Let's consider an edge case:
- Input: `func_1([[], [1, 2], [3, 4]])`
- Expected Behavior: It should handle the case properly, but the code will throw `IndexError` when it attempts to get the first element from the first empty sublist.

Due to the potential for an `IndexError` with empty sublists, the program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
