Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. According to the provided program, if any of the sublists in `lst` are empty, those sublists will not contribute an element to the resulting list. This means that the output list's length may be less than the number of sublists in `lst`, which contradicts the implied expectation that the function should return the first element of each sublist regardless of whether some sublists are empty.

For example, consider the case `func_1([[], [1, 2], [3, 4]])`. The expected output would need to account for the fact that the first sublist is empty. The current implementation would skip the first sublist entirely, producing `[1, 3]` instead of returning a length consistent with the input (e.g., possibly more indicative output like `[None, 1, 3]` or raising an error).

Thus, the program fails to adhere to the specification of producing a list containing the first element from each sublist without omitting any elements based on the content of the sublists.
