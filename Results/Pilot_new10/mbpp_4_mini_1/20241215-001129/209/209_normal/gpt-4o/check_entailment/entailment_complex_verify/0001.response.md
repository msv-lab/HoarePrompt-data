The original assessment pointed out that the function `func_1` has issues with handling edge cases, such as empty sublists and an empty input list, which could lead to an `IndexError`. It concluded that the correctness of the program is **False** due to these potential issues.

However, the annotated code clarifies that the function is designed to return the first elements of the sublists, and if any sublist is empty, it will simply skip that entry, leading to a reduced output list without throwing an error. Additionally, the assumptions about valid inputs imply that the user won't provide invalid data that could lead to errors.

Given that we assume proper input and that the function handles cases acknowledging valid input without error, the issues raised in the original assessment do not actually prevent the function from fulfilling its purpose according to the problem description.

Thus, after reviewing the annotations and considering the assumptions about the inputs, the original assessment appears to be unduly critical with regard to the function's correctness.

Final: **True**
