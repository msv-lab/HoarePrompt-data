The original assessment correctly identifies potential edge cases, such as the handling of empty sublists, which is crucial to fully understanding the correctness of the program. However, in the context of the provided annotations and the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., no empty sublists or invalid input types), the assessment may be perceived as too cautious.

According to the annotated version of the code, `func_1` is straightforward in its purpose: it returns the first element from each sublist, given that it operates on a list of lists. The annotations confirm that, as stated, the precondition for `lst` being a list of lists allows the function to execute correctly without throwing errors, as long as the user adheres to the expected input format.

Given that the problem description doesn't explicitly require the function to handle edge cases like empty sublists, and under the assumption of valid input, the function behaves correctly according to its intended purpose. 

Therefore, while the original assessment raised valid points about potential pitfalls, the assumption of valid input means those risks do not apply. Thus, the original assessment could be considered overly critical.

Final: **True**.
