Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case of empty sublists correctly. According to the problem description and the output hints, the function is supposed to return the first element of each sublist. However, if a sublist is empty, the code will skip that sublist entirely, resulting in a shorter output list than the number of sublists present.

For example, consider the input `func_1([[1, 2], [], [3, 4]])`. The expected output would be `[1, 3]` since the second sublist is empty and should contribute no element. However, the code will result in `[1, 3]`, effectively skipping over the empty sublist but doing so without explicitly indicating what happened. This behavior does not align with the requirement of handling all sublists, and it makes the function potentially misleading in terms of output size.

Thus, since the program does not fulfill the requirement for every potential case, the Correctness is deemed **False**.
