The original assessment accurately identifies a critical issue with the implementation of the function `func_1`. The program does not handle the potential case of empty sublists, which will indeed lead to an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element of those empty sublists. 

The output hints state that if any sublist is empty, it will not contribute any element, and thus the resultant list may indeed have a length less than the total number of sublists. However, this behavior of skipping entries is contingent on the assumption that the input will not lead to an error. If the assumptions about input are relaxed—even slightly—the program's risk of raising an error due to empty sublists is a crucial flaw, and it directly conflicts with the problem description which implies retrieving elements safely.

Considering all of this, the original assessment's prediction of correctness as **False**, due to the potential for an error with empty sublists, remains valid.

Final: **False**.
