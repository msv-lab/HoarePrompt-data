Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where any of the sublists are empty. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to return the first element of each sublist. If a sublist is empty, attempting to access the first element will result in an `IndexError`. The output hints indicate that this scenario is not managed by the code and highlight the assumption that all sublists contain at least one element. Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
