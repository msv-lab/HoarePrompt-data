#State of the program right berfore the function call: sublists is a list of lists.
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in the list 'sublists'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists called `sublists` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. If any sublist is empty, it will cause an IndexError, but this case is not handled in the code. Therefore, the function assumes that all sublists contain at least one element; otherwise, an error will occur.
