To verify the program, I will analyze the provided function `func_1` against the problem description, which is to get the first element of each sublist from a given list of sublists.

The function `func_1` is defined as:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

### Potential Cases to Consider:
1. **Empty List of Sublists**: 
    - Input: `[]`
    - Expected Output: `[]` (returns an empty list as there are no sublists)
    - Actual Output: `[]`  (matches)

2. **Sublists with Various Lengths**: 
    - Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]`
    - Expected Output: `[1, 3, 5]`
    - Actual Output: `[1, 3, 5]`  (matches)

3. **Sublists with Single Element**:
    - Input: `[[42], [23], [17]]`
    - Expected Output: `[42, 23, 17]`
    - Actual Output: `[42, 23, 17]`  (matches)

4. **Sublists with Empty Sublists**:
    - Input: `[[1, 2], [], [5]]`
    - Expected Output: `[1, 5]` (the second sublist is empty and should not return anything)
    - Actual Output: This will raise an `IndexError` because trying to access the element `0` of an empty sublist will fail.

### Conclusion:
The last test case demonstrates that the function does not handle the scenario where any of the sublists is empty, leading to an `IndexError`. Since the program fails to meet the requirements in every potential case due to this oversight, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
