To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to assess if `func_1` handles all potential cases, including edge cases.

The function `func_1` is designed to return the first element of each sublist from a given list of lists. The assertions provided check a few different cases, which include:

1. Lists of varying lengths.
2. Lists containing multiple elements in sublists.

### Potential Edge Cases:

1. **Empty sublists**: If one of the sublists is empty (e.g., `func_1([[], [1, 2]])`), the function will throw an `IndexError` because it attempts to access the first element of an empty list.

2. **Empty input list**: If the input list itself is empty (e.g., `func_1([])`), the function will return an empty list which might be an acceptable scenario based on the problem description but is not handled in the original assertions.

3. **Mixed type elements**: Although the problem does not specify the types of elements in the sublists, if some sublists contain non-list items or are of different types (e.g., `func_1([[1, 2], 'not a list'])`), this could lead to incorrect behavior since the function expects sublists.

### Example of failure:
- Calling `func_1([[], [1, 2]])` results in:
  ```python
  IndexError: list index out of range
  ```

### Conclusion:
Due to the possibility of encountering an `IndexError` with empty sublists, the program does not correctly handle all potential input scenarios as described. 

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.
