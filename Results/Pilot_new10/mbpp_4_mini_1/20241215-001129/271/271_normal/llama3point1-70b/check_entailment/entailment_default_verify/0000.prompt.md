You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

**Problem Description:** 
Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

### Analyzing the Code:

1. **Functionality:**
   - The program uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the tuple of tuples, allowing us to compute averages across the corresponding positions.
   - For each transposed position (`val`), it calculates the sum of the values and divides by the number of tuples to get the average.

2. **Potential Issues:**
   - If `tuples` is an empty tuple, `len(tuples)` will be `0`, leading to a division by zero when calculating the average.
   - If the tuples have different lengths, this will not be handled properly. The `zip` function stops at the shortest tuple, so any unaccounted elements in longer tuples will be ignored.

### Testing with Edge Cases:

1. **Empty Input:**
   - Input: `()`
     - Here, `zip(*tuples)` will return an empty iterator, and the program will attempt to divide by zero because `len(tuples)` will be `0`. This will result in a runtime error.

2. **Different Length Tuples:**
   - Input: `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))`
     - Here, `zip(*tuples)` will only consider `(1, 4)` and `(2, 5)`, and the third position will be omitted. Therefore, it will only calculate averages for the first two positions (1 and 4; 2 and 5), and there won't be a correct average for the last position, which violates the problem's requirement to compute averages for each position. 

Based on the observations, the program does not handle the division by zero error and does not account for varying lengths of the input tuples. 

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and returns a list of averages for each numeric position across all inner tuples. However, if the input is an empty tuple, it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when attempting to compute the average, as it will attempt to divide by zero when calculating the length of 'tuples'. Thus, the function does not handle the case where the input 'tuples' is empty. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
