You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code.

The problem description states that the function should take a tuple of tuples and return a list containing the averages of the corresponding values from each of the input tuples. The provided function attempts to achieve this using the following line of code:

```python
return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

**Key points to consider:**

1. **Input Type**: The input must be a tuple of tuples. If an empty tuple is provided or a tuple that does not contain tuples, the code should handle that.
  
2. **Empty Input**: If an empty tuple of tuples is provided, the function will throw a division by zero error because `len(tuples)` will be `0`. This is an edge case that the code does not handle correctly, which violates the requirements of the problem statement. 

3. **Aggregation Logic**: Assuming that valid tuples are provided, the code correctly computes the average for each position. For instance, for input `((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))`, it will compute the averages as `(3.0, 4.0)`.

4. **Data Types**: The function does not check for the type of values within the inner tuples. If any of the values were non-numeric (e.g., strings), it would also raise an exception.

Since the code fails to handle the edge case of receiving an empty set of tuples and could potentially fail with incorrect data types, the correctness of this program is compromised.

Based on the above analysis, I conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False** 

**Example of Failure**: The program would fail for the input `(()`, which is an empty input. It will lead to a `ZeroDivisionError`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values.
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list containing the average of each numeric position across all inner tuples in the 'tuples' tuple of tuples.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and returns a list of averages for each numeric position across all inner tuples. However, if the input is an empty tuple, it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when attempting to compute the average, as it will attempt to divide by zero when calculating the length of 'tuples'. Thus, the function does not handle the case where the input 'tuples' is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
