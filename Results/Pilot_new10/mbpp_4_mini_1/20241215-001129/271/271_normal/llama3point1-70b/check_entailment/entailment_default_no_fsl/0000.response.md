Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input is an empty tuple. According to the problem description, the function should compute the average of values from all tuples, but if the input is empty, the program will lead to a `ZeroDivisionError`. This occurs because it attempts to compute the average by dividing by zero when there are no tuples to process.

For example, calling `func_1(())` will raise an error, which means the function is not robust against all potential cases, specifically the empty input case, thereby violating the problem requirements. Thus, the program is incorrect.
