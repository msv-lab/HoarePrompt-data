Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function attempts to compute the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the provided tuple of tuples. However, it does not handle the case where the input `tuples` is an empty tuple. In such a scenario, attempting to calculate `len(tuples)` will result in a division by zero, leading to a `ZeroDivisionError`. This means that the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case, hence it is incorrect.
