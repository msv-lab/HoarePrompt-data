The variable `averages` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables, `tuples` and `num_elements`, are unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` is equal to the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples`, and `averages` is an empty list.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` is equal to the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples`, and `averages` is an empty list.**
