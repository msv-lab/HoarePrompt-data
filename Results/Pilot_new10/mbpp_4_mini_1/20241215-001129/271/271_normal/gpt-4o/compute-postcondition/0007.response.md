The variable `elements_at_position` is assigned a list comprehension that extracts the `i`-th element from each inner tuple in `tuples`. Given that `i` is 1, elements at index 1 from each inner tuple will populate `elements_at_position`. Since `tuples` must contain at least one inner tuple with at least one element, we can analyze the output based on the possible values from the tuples.

Notice that the initial values of `num_elements` and `avg` are not directly affected by this operation, but the new value of `elements_at_position` will depend on the second elements (index 1) of the inner tuples in `tuples`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple with at least 1 element; `num_elements` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each inner tuple in `tuples`; `avg` remains equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`; `averages` is updated to include the value of `avg`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple with at least 1 element; `num_elements` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each inner tuple in `tuples`; `avg` remains equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`; `averages` is updated to include the value of `avg`.**
