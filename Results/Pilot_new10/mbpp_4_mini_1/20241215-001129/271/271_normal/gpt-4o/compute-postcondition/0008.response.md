The variable `avg` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements from the list `elements_at_position`, divided by the length of the tuple `tuples`. The precondition states that `elements_at_position` contains the second elements from each inner tuple in `tuples`, and `len(tuples)` is at least 1, thus `avg` will be a valid average based on those values. The variable `averages` is updated to include the value of `avg`, but this part is not detailed in the task requirements.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple with at least 1 element; `num_elements` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each inner tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`; `averages` is updated to include the value of `avg`.**
