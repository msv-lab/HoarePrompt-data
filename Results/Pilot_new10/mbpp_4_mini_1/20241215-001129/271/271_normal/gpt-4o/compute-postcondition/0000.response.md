The variable `num_elements` is assigned the value of the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples`. Since `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `tuples[0]` refers to the first inner tuple, and `len(tuples[0])` gives the number of numerical values contained in that tuple. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State will reflect that `num_elements` is now equal to the length of the first inner tuple.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` is equal to the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples`.**
