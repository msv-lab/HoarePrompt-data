#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns the values of b and a, which are integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in that order, effectively reversing their positions.
