Final: **True** 

The original assessment stating that the program's correctness is **True** is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly takes two numbers and returns them in a swapped order as specified in the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function behavior is consistent, as it appropriately returns `(b, a)` in the required tuple format. All provided assertions validate the function's behavior successfully. Hence, the function meets the problem requirements consistently and serves as an accurate implementation.
