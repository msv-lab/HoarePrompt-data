Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second argument `b` as the first element and the first argument `a` as the second element. 

This matches the requirement of returning a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function behaves as expected for different pairs of input numbers, demonstrating that it correctly returns the swapped order in all tested cases.

Since `func_1(a, b)` reliably returns `(b, a)` for any values of `a` and `b`, it meets the problem description's requirements comprehensively. Therefore, the program is correct.
