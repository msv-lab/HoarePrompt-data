Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two input parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing the second parameter `b` first, followed by the first parameter `a`. This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirement of the problem description, which specifies returning a tuple with the second number and then the first number.

To illustrate this further:
- If we call `func_1(1, 2)`, it returns `(2, 1)`.
- If we call `func_1(-5, 3)`, it returns `(3, -5)`.
- If we call `func_1(0, 10)`, it returns `(10, 0)`.

In every instance, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. There are no edge cases or incorrect behavior that can be found, as all inputs lead to the correct output format. Therefore, the program is correct.
