The loop checks for duplicate integers in the list `arr`. If a duplicate is found, it returns `True`; if not, it adds each integer to the set `seen`. The loop will iterate through all the elements of `arr` unless a duplicate is found earlier in the iterations.

If `arr` is non-empty and contains no duplicates, the loop will execute a number of times equal to the length of `arr`, and all integers of `arr` will be added to the set `seen`. If `arr` contains duplicates, the loop will terminate early upon finding the first duplicate.

In the case that the loop does not execute (i.e., if `arr` is an empty list), `seen` will remain an empty set.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing all unique integers from `arr`.**
