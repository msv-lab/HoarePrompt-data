The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as its parameter `arr`. It checks whether there are any duplicate integers within the list. If a duplicate is detected, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that at least one integer appears more than once. If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it returns `False`, signifying that all integers in the list are unique. 

The functionality does not specifically mention how to handle an empty list; however, since an empty list has no duplicates, the function would correctly return `False` in this case. Therefore, the summary incorporates this edge case as well.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers and returns True if any integer appears more than once; otherwise, it returns False, including for the case of an empty list which also returns False. **
