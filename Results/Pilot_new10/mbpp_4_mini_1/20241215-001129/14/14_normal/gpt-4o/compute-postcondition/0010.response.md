According to the code, the loop relies on the list `arr` to determine how many times it can run. If `arr` contains at least 3 integers, the loop can execute again for the third integer. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `arr` contains at least 2 integers, and `num` is the second integer in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must contain at least 3 integers, and `num` needs to be updated to refer to the third integer in the list. Therefore, `num` should be adjusted to the third integer in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers containing at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in `arr`, and `seen` now includes the second integer.**
