Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly checks for duplicate elements in a list of integers as per the problem description. It initializes an empty set called `seen` to track which numbers have already been encountered. As it iterates through the array, it checks if each number is already in the set. If a number is found in the set, it immediately returns `True`, indicating there is a duplicate. If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it returns `False`.

The provided assertions in the program also support this functionality:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `False` as there are no duplicates.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])` returns `True` as `4` appears twice.
- `func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5])` returns `True` as `1`, `2`, and `3` are all duplicated.

Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function should return `False` for an empty list, which is correctly handled by the program, as an empty set will not find any duplicates. 

Each potential case, including an empty list and lists with no duplicates as well as lists with duplicates, is accounted for in the logic of the function. Thus, the code meets all the requirements of the problem description correctly.
