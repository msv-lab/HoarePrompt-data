Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly concluded that the function `func_1(arr)` is accurate in determining whether any integer appears more than once in the input array. The annotated version clarifies that the program checks each number in the list against a set of already seen numbers, and it behaves as expected according to the problem description. The inputs in the test cases demonstrate that the function operates correctly by returning the expected results for both cases with and without duplicates, as well as returning `False` for an empty list, which aligns with the assessment. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
