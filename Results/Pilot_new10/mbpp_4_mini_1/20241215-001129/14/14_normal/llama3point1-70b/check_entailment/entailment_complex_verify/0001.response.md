Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate. The annotated version of the code clearly explains that the function `func_1(arr)` is designed to return `True` if there are duplicate integers in the list, which aligns perfectly with the requirement from the problem description. The analysis which stated that the logic was reversed is incorrect. 

The function compares the length of the list `arr` with the length of the corresponding set of unique integers created from that list. If the lengths differ, it correctly indicates that duplicates exist, consistent with the problem expectation that the function should return `True` for duplicates and `False` otherwise. 

Thus, since the function correctly implements the needed logic and the annotations confirm that it accurately handles all possible cases of duplicate values in the input list, the final assessment is correct: the program is functionally correct as per the problem description.
