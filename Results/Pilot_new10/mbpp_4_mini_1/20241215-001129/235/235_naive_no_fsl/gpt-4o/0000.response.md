Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It uses a while loop to iterate through each digit of the number `n`, adding each digit (obtained by `n % 10`) to a running total, and then removes the last digit from `n` by performing integer division by 10 (`n //= 10`). 

The assertions provided in the code demonstrate that the function works correctly for the specified test cases, which cover various examples of non-negative integers. Additionally, the code handles potential edge cases such as when `n` is 0 (the sum of the digits is 0).

Since no cases arise where the function fails to meet the stated requirement as per the problem description, the program is correct for all potential inputs. Therefore, I conclude that the implementation is valid.

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
