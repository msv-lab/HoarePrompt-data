Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of the number using `n % 10` and adds that to the total. Then, it updates `n` by performing an integer division by 10, effectively removing the last digit. This continues until all digits have been processed (i.e., when `n` becomes 0). 

The provided assertions confirm that the function works for the tested inputs (345 returns 12, 12 returns 3, and 97 returns 16), and since it operates correctly for all non-negative integers (the condition stated in the problem description), I don't see any edge cases that it does not handle. 

Thus, the program adheres to the requirements of the problem description.
