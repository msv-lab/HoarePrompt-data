According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer, which means it can currently be 0, so the loop will not execute. To ensure that the loop executes for the first time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is 0**
