`total` is assigned an increased value by adding the last digit of `n`, which is determined by `n % 10`. Given that `n` must have been at least 10, the last digit will be a value between 0 and 9. Thus, the output state updates `total` to reflect this addition based on the last digit of `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must have been at least 10, `total` is increased by the last digit of `n`, thus `total` is equal to the previous value of `total` plus `n % 10.**
