The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function returns `total`, which is the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`. Since `n` is 0, `total` remains 0 in this case. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the sum of its digits, which is 0 when `n` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a non-negative integer, and returns the sum of its digits, which is 0 when n is 0.**
