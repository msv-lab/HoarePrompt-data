Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic needed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function `func_1(n)` uses a while loop to iterate through each digit of `n`, adding each digit to a running total and removing the last digit from `n` until `n` becomes 0. 

The annotations confirm that if the input `n` is 0, the function will correctly return 0, and if `n` is positive, it computes the sum of its digits accurately. The provided test assertions validate these behaviors, demonstrating that the function yields the correct outputs for the given examples. 

As a result, the implementation meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and handles all specified edge cases correctly. Therefore, the conclusion that the program is correct remains valid.
