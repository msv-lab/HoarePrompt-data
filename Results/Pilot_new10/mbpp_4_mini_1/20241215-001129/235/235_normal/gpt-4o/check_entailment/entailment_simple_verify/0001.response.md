Final: **True**

The original assessment that the program is correct is accurate. The function `func_1` effectively computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer through a while loop, which extracts each digit using the modulo operation and accumulates the sum in the `total` variable. The annotated version confirms that when the input `n` is a non-negative integer, all digits are processed correctly, and the expected output aligns with the assertions provided. The handling of the edge case when `n` is 0 is properly accounted for, as the function will return 0 in that scenario without any issues. Thus, the program correctly meets the requirements laid out in the problem description.
