Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where the string is too short. For example, if the input string is a single character "z" or "a", the function `func_1` will attempt to slice the string `s[1:-1]`, which results in an empty string. In such cases, it should correctly return `False`, but the logic in the code implies that it would just check an empty substring without appropriately checking for strings shorter than 3 characters.

For instance:
- `func_1('z')` should return `False` as there are no 'z' characters except at the start.
- `func_1('a')` should return `False` for the same reason.

Thus, the function fails to handle these edge cases correctly.
