Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's why it adheres to the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(s)` takes a single string input `s`, which matches the requirement to check if it contains the character 'z' in any of its words.

2. **Word Splitting**: The program splits the input string into a list of words using `s.split()`. This ensures that each word is examined individually.

3. **Iterating through Words**: The program iterates through each word in the list. 

4. **Length Check**: Within the loop, there is a condition to check if the length of the word is greater than 1 (`if len(word) > 1`). This aligns with the requirement to only consider 'z' in words that are not a single character (to avoid checking 'z' at the start or end).

5. **Checking for 'z'**: The program checks for the presence of 'z' in the substring `word[1:-1]`, which is the portion of the word that excludes the first and last characters. This directly adheres to the requirement of ensuring 'z' is not located at the start or the end of the word.

6. **Return Values**: If any word satisfies the conditions, the function returns `True`. If none of the words meet these criteria, it returns `False`. Thus, the logic ensures that the program returns a value based purely on the correctness of the conditions mentioned.

In conclusion, the program strictly follows the problem description and correctly identifies if any words in the given string contain the character 'z', excluding the start and end of any word.
