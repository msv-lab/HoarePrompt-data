Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. 

1. The primary issue is that the function does not handle input that is not a string properly. For example, if the input is a number or None, it will raise an `AttributeError` when calling the `split()` method, as those types do not have this method. This violates the requirement to handle all potential inputs correctly.

2. Additionally, the output hints indicate that the function should immediately return `False` for an empty string, which it does. However, since the function could potentially receive non-string inputs without handling them gracefully, it could lead to incorrect behavior in such cases.

Therefore, since the program does not handle all possible input types correctly, the correctness is marked as **False**.
