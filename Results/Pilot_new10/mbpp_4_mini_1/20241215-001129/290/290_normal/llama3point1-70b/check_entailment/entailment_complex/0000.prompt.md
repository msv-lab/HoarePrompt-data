You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of words, `word` is the last word in the list. The loop will only return True if at least one `word` has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If no such word is found, the return value is None. If `words` is empty, the loop does not execute and `word` is undefined.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that there are no words that are greater than 1 in length and contain the character 'z' in the specified substring. If there were any words present, the function would have executed a check, but since it returns False, it implies none of those conditions were met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s`, splits it into words, and checks if any of those words have a length greater than 1 and contain the character 'z' within their substring (excluding the first and last characters). It returns True if such a word is found, and False if no such word exists. An edge case includes an empty string input, which results in an immediate return of False, since there would be no words to check. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a string; such a scenario could lead to an AttributeError when attempting to call the split() method.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
