Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `words` is a list containing at least 2 words, and `word` is the second word in the list. If the length of `word` is greater than 1 and the character 'z' appears in the substring of `word` from the second character to the second last character, the function returns True. If either of these conditions is not met, no return value is specified.***
