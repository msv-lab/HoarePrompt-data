According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `words` list. If the list has at least 1 word, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will also ensure that `word` is set to the last element of the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute properly, the `words` list must have at least 1 element, `word` should be the first word in the list, and `words` is created by splitting the string `s` on whitespace.

State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list of words that must have at least 1 word, `word` is the first word in the list**
