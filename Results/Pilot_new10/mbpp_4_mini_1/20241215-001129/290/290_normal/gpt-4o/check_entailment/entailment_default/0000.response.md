The provided program correctly checks for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring of the input string `s`, excluding the first and the last characters. The implementation has the correct logic because it uses slicing to create the substring `s[1:-1]`, which omits the first and last characters.

Let's analyze the output hints and assertions:

1. The first assertion `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True` is correct because the substring `pythonzabc` (which is `ythonzab` when we slice) does contain 'z'.
2. The second assertion `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False` is also correct because the substring `zxyabc.` (which is `xyabc`) does not contain 'z'.
3. The third assertion `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False` works as well since the substring here is fully empty due to being just whitespace characters between the first and last character, certainly not containing 'z'.

The output hints clarify that the function checks a substring which inherently returns False for strings where the `s` has fewer than three characters, since the slice `s[1:-1]` will not have any characters in them.

Considering all points checked, and given that it appears there are no edge cases missed with the slicing logic, I can determine that the implementation correctly follows the problem description for every potential case mentioned.

Correctness: **True**.
