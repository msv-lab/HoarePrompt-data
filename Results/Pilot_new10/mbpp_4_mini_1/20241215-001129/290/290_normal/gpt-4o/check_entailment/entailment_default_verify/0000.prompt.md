You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True
assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False
assert func_1('  lang  .') == False

def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where the string is too short. For example, if the input string is a single character "z" or "a", the function `func_1` will attempt to slice the string `s[1:-1]`, which results in an empty string. In such cases, it should correctly return `False`, but the logic in the code implies that it would just check an empty substring without appropriately checking for strings shorter than 3 characters.

For instance:
- `func_1('z')` should return `False` as there are no 'z' characters except at the start.
- `func_1('a')` should return `False` for the same reason.

Thus, the function fails to handle these edge cases correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a string `s` with at least 1 character, and it checks for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If 'z' is found, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. If the string `s` has only one character, the substring check will automatically lead to a return of False since there are no characters between the first and last positions. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
