#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string with at least 1 character.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the substring of 's' from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the character 'z'.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string with at least 1 character, and the substring of `s` from the second to the second-to-last character does not contain the character 'z'.
    return False
    #The program returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` with at least 1 character, and it checks for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If 'z' is found, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. If the string `s` has only one character, the substring check will automatically lead to a return of False since there are no characters between the first and last positions.
