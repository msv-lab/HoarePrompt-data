Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. The function `func_1` works as follows:

1. It converts the input list `nums` into a set to eliminate duplicates using `set(nums)`, ensuring that only unique numbers remain.
2. It then converts this set back into a list with `list(set(nums))`.
3. If the length of this list is less than 2 (indicating that there are not enough unique numbers to determine a second smallest), the function returns `None`.
4. Finally, it sorts the unique list and returns the element at index 1, which is the second smallest number.

The function handles cases where:
- The input list has fewer than two unique elements by returning `None`.
- It properly sorts the unique numbers, ensuring the second smallest can be accurately found.

For example:
- Input: `[3, 1, 2, 2]` → Unique numbers: `[1, 2, 3]` → Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]` → Output: `2`
- Input: `[1, 1, 1]` → Unique numbers: `[1]` → Output: `None` (correct handling for not enough unique numbers)

Since any edge cases where the input may not be suitable are effectively handled (returning `None` when necessary), and the desired functionality is correctly implemented for valid inputs, I find no errors or missing logic in the program. Thus, the correctness holds true under the problem description.
