#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
    #The program returns the second unique integer from the sorted list `unique_nums`, only if there is more than one unique integer; otherwise, it returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the second unique integer from the sorted list of unique integers derived from `nums` if there is more than one unique integer. If there is only one unique integer or if `nums` is not provided correctly (e.g., fewer than two elements, although this is stated not to be the case), the function returns `None`.
