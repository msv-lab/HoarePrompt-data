Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the problem description because it does not handle all edge cases properly regarding the presence of unique numbers. Specifically:

1. If the list consists of only one unique element repeated multiple times (like the cases `func_1([2, 2])` or `func_1([2, 2, 2])`), the function correctly returns `None`, which is appropriate according to the logic in the function. However, it fails to meet the requirement of finding the second smallest number from a list that might have duplicates.

2. The case `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])` should indeed return `-2` as correctly asserted, but that is not the only case to consider.

3. A critical issue arises with the list that contains more than two unique numbers. The program might not produce the correct second smallest number if there are duplicate values, and the context is not defined for handling ties. Although the sorting eliminates duplicates, it might not always be aligned with the expectations of the second smallest logic if interpreted differently (e.g., second smallest by frequency of occurrence, etc.)

Overall, the function does not guarantee that it adheres to the clear intention of retrieving the second smallest element across all plausible scenarios, particularly leading to ambiguities with non-unique values. Hence, it does not fully comply with the problem description's requirements.
