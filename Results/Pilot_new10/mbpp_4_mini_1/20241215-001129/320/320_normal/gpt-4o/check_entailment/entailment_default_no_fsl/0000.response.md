Correctness: **False**

The provided program aims to find the second smallest unique number in a given list of integers. However, it does not correctly handle the case of lists containing only duplicate numbers or lists with fewer than two unique numbers.

While the code correctly sorts and extracts unique numbers, it fails in the following cases:
1. The assertion `assert func_1([2, 2])` correctly returns `None`, which is expected since there is only one unique number (2).
2. The assertion `assert func_1([2, 2, 2])` also correctly returns `None`.
3. However, the program does not explicitly handle the case for an empty list or lists that contain fewer than two unique elements, as described in the provided output hints. If the input list is empty (`[]`), this will cause an index error when trying to access `unique_nums[1]`.

Additionally, the output hints mention that if `nums` is not provided correctly, such as having fewer than two elements, the function should return `None`. While the program behaves consistently for non-empty inputs, an empty list input would lead to an unhandled error.

Thus, because the program does not work correctly for cases like an empty list or when fewer than two unique numbers are present, the overall correctness is deemed false.
