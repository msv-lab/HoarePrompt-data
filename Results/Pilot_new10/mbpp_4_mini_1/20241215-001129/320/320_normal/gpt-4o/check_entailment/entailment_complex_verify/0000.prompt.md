You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2
assert func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5
assert func_1([2, 2]) == None
assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None

def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. It converts the list of numbers into a set to ensure all elements are unique, sorts them, and then checks if there are at least two unique numbers. If there are, it returns the second smallest; otherwise, it returns `None`.

Here are the relevant cases from the assertions:

1. `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])` returns `-2`, which is correct as `-2` is the second smallest.
2. `func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2])` returns `-0.5`, which is also correct since `-2` is the smallest and `-0.5` is the second smallest.
3. `func_1([2, 2])` returns `None`, which is correct as there is no second unique number.
4. `func_1([2, 2, 2])` again returns `None`, which is correct for the same reason.

No edge cases were identified where the function does not behave as expected. It handles duplicates correctly and returns the appropriate value when there isn't a second unique number. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2
assert func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5
assert func_1([2, 2]) == None
assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
    #The program returns the second unique integer from the sorted list `unique_nums`, only if there is more than one unique integer; otherwise, it returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the second unique integer from the sorted list of unique integers derived from `nums` if there is more than one unique integer. If there is only one unique integer or if `nums` is not provided correctly (e.g., fewer than two elements, although this is stated not to be the case), the function returns `None`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
