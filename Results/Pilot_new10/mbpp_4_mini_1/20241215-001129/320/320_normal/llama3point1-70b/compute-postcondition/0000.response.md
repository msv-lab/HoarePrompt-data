The code creates a set from `nums`, which removes duplicate integers, and then converts that set back into a list assigned to `unique_nums`. The original list `nums` remains unchanged, but `unique_nums` will contain only the unique elements.

Therefore, the Output State reflects that `unique_nums` is now a list of unique integers derived from `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`.**
