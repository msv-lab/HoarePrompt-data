You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:
        return None
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. The function `func_1` works as follows:

1. It converts the input list `nums` into a set to eliminate duplicates using `set(nums)`, ensuring that only unique numbers remain.
2. It then converts this set back into a list with `list(set(nums))`.
3. If the length of this list is less than 2 (indicating that there are not enough unique numbers to determine a second smallest), the function returns `None`.
4. Finally, it sorts the unique list and returns the element at index 1, which is the second smallest number.

The function handles cases where:
- The input list has fewer than two unique elements by returning `None`.
- It properly sorts the unique numbers, ensuring the second smallest can be accurately found.

For example:
- Input: `[3, 1, 2, 2]` → Unique numbers: `[1, 2, 3]` → Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]` → Output: `2`
- Input: `[1, 1, 1]` → Unique numbers: `[1]` → Output: `None` (correct handling for not enough unique numbers)

Since any edge cases where the input may not be suitable are effectively handled (returning `None` when necessary), and the desired functionality is correctly implemented for valid inputs, I find no errors or missing logic in the program. Thus, the correctness holds true under the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `nums` with at least two elements. It returns None if there are fewer than two unique integers in `nums`. If there are at least two unique integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer from `nums`. If there are exactly two unique integers, it will return the larger one as the second smallest value. The code handles edge cases where less than two unique integers are present properly. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
