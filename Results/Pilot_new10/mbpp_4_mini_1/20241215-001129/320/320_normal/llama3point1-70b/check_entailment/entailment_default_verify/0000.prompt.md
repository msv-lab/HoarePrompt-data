You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:
        return None
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly identifies the second smallest unique number in a list. Hereâ€™s why it works for all potential cases:

1. It converts the list into a set to remove duplicates, ensuring only unique elements are considered.
2. If the length of the unique list is less than 2, it correctly returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest number.
3. For lists with at least two unique numbers, it sorts the unique elements and returns the second smallest number by indexing.

This logic correctly handles edge cases like:
- A list with all identical numbers (returns `None`).
- A list with exactly two unique numbers (correctly returns the larger one).
- Negative numbers and mixed positive/negative numbers (sorts and identifies the second smallest regardless of sign).

Thus, it satisfies the requirements of the problem description for every potential input case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `nums` with at least two elements. It returns None if there are fewer than two unique integers in `nums`. If there are at least two unique integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer from `nums`. If there are exactly two unique integers, it will return the larger one as the second smallest value. The code handles edge cases where less than two unique integers are present properly. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
