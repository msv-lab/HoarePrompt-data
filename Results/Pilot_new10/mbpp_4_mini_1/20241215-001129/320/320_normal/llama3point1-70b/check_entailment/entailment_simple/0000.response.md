Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the task of finding the second smallest number in a list according to the problem description. Hereâ€™s an explanation of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Assumption**: The program starts with the assumption that the input list (`nums`) contains at least two elements. This aligns with the requirement that we must have a valid list to find the second smallest number.

2. **Unique Values**: The program converts the list into a set to eliminate duplicates, then back to a list (`unique_nums`). The use of `set(nums)` ensures that only unique integers are considered when determining the second smallest value.

3. **Length Check**: The program checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If it is, it returns `None`, which is a safeguard for cases when there are not enough unique numbers. However, the problem states that the list will always have at least two elements, so this case should not arise in the provided context.

4. **Finding the Second Smallest**: Finally, if there are at least two unique numbers, the program sorts `unique_nums` and returns the second element (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`). Sorting guarantees that the second element will indeed be the second smallest unique number.

This thorough approach ensures that the program fulfills the requirement of identifying the second smallest unique number from a list of integers. It appropriately handles scenarios involving duplicates and correctly retrieves the desired value. Therefore, the implementation rightly meets the expectations of the problem description.
