Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the list contains negative integers. For example, consider the input `nums = [-3, -1, -2]`. The program will return `-2` as the second smallest number. However, according to the output hint interpretation, if both unique integers are negative, `-1` would be the second smallest. 

Moreover, the limit of having "exactly two unique integers" is not adequately handled by the code comment, as it suggests returning the larger integer as the second smallest value, which could lead to confusion in understanding the actual expected behavior.

Therefore, the provided code does not adhere fully to the requirements specified in the problem description for every possible input case.
