To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the implementation provided:

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that takes a list and an integer `n`, and splits the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Understanding the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range of `n`.
   - For each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, it extracts elements from the list `lst` starting from index `i` and picking every `n`th element thereafter (slicing).

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - For `n = 3`, given a list like `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, the expected split would be:
     - First list: indices 0, 3, 6 → resulting in `[0, 3, 6]`
     - Second list: indices 1, 4, 7 → resulting in `[1, 4, 7]`
     - Third list: indices 2, 5, 8 → resulting in `[2, 5, 8]`
   - Thus, the final output for this example should be `[[0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8]]`.

3. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will return multiple empty lists depending on `n`. For example, for `lst = [1, 2]` and `n = 5`, the output would be `[[], [], [], [], []]`, which could be considered incorrect as it doesn't appropriately reflect the intention of creating "segments" of the list.
   - If `n` is `0`, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur since the step in slicing cannot be zero. 

4. **Conclusion**:
Given that the function may produce outputs (empty lists) in cases where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, and it will raise a runtime error if `n` is zero, the program does not handle these edge cases correctly.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails for cases where `n` is greater than the length of the list or when `n` is zero, which are potential input scenarios and do not comply with the problem description.
