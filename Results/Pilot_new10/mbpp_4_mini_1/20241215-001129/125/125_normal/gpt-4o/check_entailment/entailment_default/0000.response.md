Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` and effectively creates `n` sublists by iterating over the elements of `lst` and using the remainder of the index divided by `n` to distribute elements into the respective sublists. Each sublist contains elements that were originally at indices yielding the same remainder when divided by `n`. 

The output hints accurately describe the function's behavior, affirming that it returns `n` sublists corresponding to the distribution based on modulo `n`. The hints also mention that if the length of `lst` is not a multiple of `n`, the resulting sublists might be uneven, which is a correct statement given the nature of the index-based distribution.

Furthermore, all test cases provided in the assertions match the expected output, confirming the program's correctness for the described functionality. Thus, there is no evidence of the program failing on any potential case described in the problem statement. 

Therefore, the code meets all requirements laid out in the problem description.
