The original assessment rightly pointed out that the function `func_1` does not handle the case where `n` is zero. This is a valid concern since performing modulo operation with zero as the divisor would lead to a `ZeroDivisionError`. The assessment concluded that the program is not correct due to this potential failure case.

However, the problem description asserts that the function should take a list and a positive integer `n`. The original assessment assumed inputs could include zero for `n`, which is inconsistent with the problem description that implies it is meant to accept only valid, positive integers for `n`. 

Based on the annotations and the clarity of the problem description, we can infer that the code functions correctly when given valid inputs consistent with what is expected. Since it does behave as per the definition when `n` is greater than zero, and we are operating under the assumption that the inputs are valid, the program does not need to handle the division by zero case.

Therefore, with the understanding that input assumptions hold valid according to the problem description:

Final: **True**
