To evaluate the code provided and determine the output state, let's analyze the impact of the line of code provided carefully.

From the initial state, we know:
- `lst` has at least 2 elements (let's assume it has `n` elements where `n >= 2`).
- `i` is 1.
- `element` is the second element in `lst` (let's denote this as `lst[1]`).

The line of code:
```
result[i % n].append(element)
```
This line performs the following operations:
1. `i % n` calculates the remainder when `i` (which is 1) is divided by `n`. Since `n` is at least 2, `i % n` will always be 1.
2. This means the code will append `element` (which is `lst[1]`) to the list located at `result[1]`.

Since we're appending the `element` to `result[1]`, we should note that `result` must be an appropriately initialized list of lists (or any kind of list-like structure that supports `append`).

Thus, we'll conclude that the value of `result[1]` has changed to include `element`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`lst` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `element` is the second element in `lst`, and `result[1]` now includes the value of `element`.**
