The variable `result` is being updated by appending the `element` to the list at the index `i % n`. The value of `i` is currently 0, and `n` is the length of the list `lst`. Since `lst` must have at least 1 element, `n` is at least 1. The `element` is the first element in `lst`. Therefore, `i % n` will be 0, and the first index of `result` (which is `result[0]`) will have `element` appended to it.

The state of the other variables is not affected:

- `lst` continues to have at least 1 element.
- `i` remains 0.
- `element` remains the first element in `lst`.
- The only change will occur in `result`, as `element` is appended to `result[0]`.

Output State: **`lst` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in `lst`, and `element` is appended to `result[0]`.**
