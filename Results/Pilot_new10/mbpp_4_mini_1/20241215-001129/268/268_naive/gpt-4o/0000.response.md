To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we first need to check if it handles all potential cases.

The problem description asks for a function that returns the maximum value of the nth column from a matrix represented as a list of lists. The provided program has a few assertions meant to test this function.

Examining the function `func_1`:
1. **Extracts the nth column** from the matrix using a list comprehension: 
   ```python
   nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
   ```
   This will throw an `IndexError` if `n` is out of bounds for any of the rows in the matrix. For example:
   - If we have a matrix like `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` (which has only 2 columns) and we call `func_1(matrix, 2)`, this will raise an `IndexError` because there is no 2nd column.
   
2. **Returns the maximum value** of the extracted nth column:
   ```python
   return max(nth_column)
   ```
   This assumes that the nth column is non-empty, but if `n` were out of bounds, the earlier line could potentially not behave as expected.

We can run through possible edge cases:
- An empty matrix: `func_1([], 0)` will cause `IndexError`.
- A case where `n` is negative or larger than the number of columns.
- Rows of varied lengths: `func_1([[1, 2], [3]], 1)` will raise an `IndexError` since the 2nd element does not exist in the 2nd row.

Given these points, the program does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds or rows have differing lengths, leading to potential runtime errors.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the situation where `n` is out of bounds for the matrix provided and can raise exceptions for some inputs instead of returning a valid result or indicating an error.
