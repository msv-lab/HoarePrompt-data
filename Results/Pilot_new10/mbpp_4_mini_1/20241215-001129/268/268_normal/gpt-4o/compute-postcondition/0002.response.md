The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `matrix` and `n`. 

1. `matrix` is a list of lists (2D list) of numbers.
2. `n` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq n < \text{len(matrix[0])} \) if `matrix` is not empty.

After executing the function body, it returns the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix, where this nth column contains the nth elements from each row of the matrix.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a 2D list of numbers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return the maximum value found in the nth column of the matrix. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter matrix (a 2D list of numbers) and a non-negative integer n, returning the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix.**
