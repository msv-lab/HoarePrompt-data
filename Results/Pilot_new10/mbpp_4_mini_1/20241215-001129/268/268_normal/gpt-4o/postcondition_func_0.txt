The function accepts a 2D list (matrix) of numbers and a non-negative integer n, and it returns the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix. An edge case to consider is when the matrix is empty; in such a case, accessing the nth column would lead to an IndexError since there are no columns to retrieve. Therefore, adequate error handling should be implemented for an empty matrix scenario.
