Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input matrix is empty. According to the problem description, the function is required to return the maximum of the nth column of a matrix represented as a list of lists. However, if the matrix is empty, an attempt to access the nth column would result in an `IndexError`, which indicates that the program does not output a valid result under this scenario. The program lacks error handling for the case of an empty matrix, which is a situation that must be accounted for based on the problem requirements. Therefore, it fails to fulfill the requirements of the problem description comprehensively.
