Correctness: **True**

The program provided meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to write a function that returns the maximum value of the nth column in a matrix represented as a list of lists.

Here's the reasoning behind the correctness:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `matrix` (a list of lists) and `n` (a non-negative integer).

2. **Extracting the nth Column**: The line `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]` correctly extracts the nth elements from each row of the matrix. This is done using a list comprehension, which iterates over each `row` in the `matrix` and retrieves the `n`th element.

3. **Finding the Maximum**: The function then utilizes `max(nth_column)` to find and return the maximum value from the `nth_column` list that was created earlier.

4. **Input Constraints**: The program assumes (and is verified by the assert statements) that `n` is within the bounds of the columns in the matrix, meaning `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])` as long as the `matrix` is not empty.

5. **Test Cases**: The assert statements provide test cases that cover various scenarios, ensuring that the function returns the correct maximum value for the specified column across different matrices.

Therefore, since the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, we conclude that it is indeed correct.
