Final: **False**

The original assessment indicates that the program is incorrect due to a lack of handling edge cases such as an empty input matrix or invalid column indices. However, the annotated version clarifies that the program assumes valid input, where `matrix` is a non-empty list of lists and `n` is a valid index. Thus, the assessment that the program is incorrect is not accurate, as it is stated that it should be assumed that input will always be valid, which meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
