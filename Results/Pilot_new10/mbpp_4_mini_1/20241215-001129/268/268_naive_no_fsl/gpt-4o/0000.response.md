To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the code and consider various potential input cases.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that, given a matrix represented as a list of lists, returns the maximum value from the nth column.

### Provided Code:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)

assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19
assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10
assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11
```

### Analysis:
1. **Basic Functionality:** The function retrieves the nth column from the provided matrix.
2. **Maximum Value:** It then computes the maximum value of that column using the `max()` function.
3. **Assumed Input Validity:** The implementation assumes that the provided `n` is a valid index for all rows in the matrix.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Empty Matrix:** If the matrix is empty, the function will result in an error when attempting to access `row[n]`.
- **Column Index Out of Bounds:** If `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix, it will also result in an index error.
- **Single Row Matrix:** A single-row case will work as expected but should be tested for completeness.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Matrix:**
   - `func_1([], 0)` would raise an index error since there are no rows.
   
2. **Index Out of Bounds:**
   - For a matrix such as `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`, calling `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 3)` would result in an index error since there is no 4th column.

3. **Single Row Matrix:**
   - Should work correctly but needs explicit confirmation like `func_1([[5]], 0)` resulting in `5`.

Since the code does not handle cases where the input matrix is empty or when `n` exceeds the number of columns, we can conclude that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle edge cases such as an empty matrix or an out-of-bounds column index, which would lead to runtime errors. Thus, the implementation does not satisfy the requirement of returning the maximum of the nth column for every potential input scenario.
