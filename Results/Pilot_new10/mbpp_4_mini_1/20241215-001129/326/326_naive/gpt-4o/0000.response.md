Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where the input array has fewer than two distinct elements. If all elements in the input array are the same, the computed minimum difference will incorrectly return 0 instead of indicating that no difference exists. For example, the case `func_1((5, 5, 5, 5), 4)` should return an indication that there is no minimum difference or handle it in a way consistent with the problem statement. 

Additionally, if the array is empty or has only one element (which should return a minimum difference of 0 based on the existing logic), it should clearly indicate that a minimum difference cannot be calculated. Therefore, the program fails to address edge cases appropriately and is thus incorrect.
