According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and since `n` is a positive integer that is greater than or equal to 2, `n - 1` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1, and therefore `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (which it already is).

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr` that is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1**
