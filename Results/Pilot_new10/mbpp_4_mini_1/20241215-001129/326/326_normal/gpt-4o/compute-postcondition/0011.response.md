In the given initial state, `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr` that is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 1. The code snippet calculates the difference between the elements in the array at index `i + 1` and `i`.

Specifically, `diff` is assigned the value of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, the indices accessed will be `arr[2]` and `arr[1]`, meaning `diff` will be computed as `arr[2] - arr[1]`.

The value of `diff` depends on the specific values of `arr[2]` and `arr[1]`, but the state of `arr`, `n`, and `i` remains unchanged after the operation.

Therefore, since `diff` is calculated but not stored as a variable outside of its local context, we reflect the impact of the assignment.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr` greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.**
