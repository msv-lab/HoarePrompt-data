The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. The parameter `arr` is a list of integers, and `n` is a positive integer that is equal to the length of `arr`. If the length of `arr` is less than 2 (which implies that `n` is also less than 2), the function returns `0`. If the length of `arr` is 2 or more, the function returns `min_diff`, which represents the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers and its length, returning `0` if the list has fewer than 2 elements; otherwise, it returns the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and its length `n`, returns `0` if `arr` has fewer than 2 elements; otherwise, it returns the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.**
