According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr`, which is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, making it 2. At this point, we must ensure that `i` is still less than `n - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]` (same as before)**
