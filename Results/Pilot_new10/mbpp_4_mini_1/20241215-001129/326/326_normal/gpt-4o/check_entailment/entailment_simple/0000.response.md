Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which requires finding the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's how the program meets all aspects of the description:

1. **Input Validity**: The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and an integer `n` (which represents the length of the array). The function checks if `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in that case. This is a reasonable check, as a minimum difference cannot be computed with fewer than two elements.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the array. Sorting is crucial because the minimum difference between two elements will always occur between two adjacent elements in a sorted list. Thus, this step is consistent with needing to find the minimum difference between any two elements in `arr`.

3. **Finding Minimum Difference**: It initializes `min_diff` to infinity and then iterates through the sorted array to compute the difference between consecutive elements. If a smaller difference is found, it updates `min_diff`. This method effectively captures the smallest difference between any two elements, as required by the problem statement.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the smallest difference found, which is precisely what the problem specifies.

Example assertions provided in the annotated program demonstrate that the function appropriately calculates minimum differences for various cases. Given its structure and logic, the program will work correctly for all valid input arrays of integers, making it correct according to the problem description.

In conclusion, since the program accurately finds the minimum difference between any two elements in an array, it fulfills the requirements, and therefore, the correctness is affirmed.
