Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program aims to find the minimum difference between any two elements in an array, but it only calculates the absolute differences between adjacent elements in the sorted list. This means that it will overlook cases where the minimum difference occurs between non-adjacent elements. For example, consider the array `[1, 5, 3]`. The minimum difference between elements in this array is `2` (between `3` and `5`), but the function will only compare adjacent pairs once sorted, which leads to incorrectly returning `1` (between `1` and `3`). Additionally, the presence of `target` as an unused parameter doesn't influence the result and might indicate that the function is not fully addressing the problem as stated. Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem's requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements.
