The original assessment accurately highlights the issues present in the provided program. Although the annotated version states that `arr` is assumed to have at least two elements, this assumption contradicts the problem description which does not specify the size of the input list. Given that the goal is to find the minimum difference between any two elements, the function must handle cases where the list has fewer than two elements correctly by either returning an appropriate error or indicative value.

Thus, it is important to consider edge cases such as an empty array or a single-element array as potential inputs for the function. Since the function does not handle these conditions and may return a misleading result (positive infinity), the original assessment's conclusion remains valid and correct.

Final: **False**
