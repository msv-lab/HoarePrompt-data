The original assessment pointed out that the program fails to handle edge cases, specifically when the input array is empty or contains only one element, leading to a potential error or undefined behavior. 

However, the annotated version clearly states that the program is expected to receive valid input and clarifies that, if the input array contains fewer than 2 elements, `min_diff` will remain positive infinity. This implies that there's an understanding that the function should not be called with less than 2 elements, which aligns with the assumption of valid inputs outlined in the task.

Thus, while the program does have limitations in terms of input validation, the assumption states that valid inputs will always be provided. Given this context, the statement about edge case handling becomes irrelevant since we're not considering invalid inputs as part of the assessment.

Considering this, the program correctly sorts the array and calculates the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted list as expected per the problem description.

Based on the annotated version of the code and the understanding of the problem description, the original assessment about the correctness of the program is not accurate. 

Final: **True**.
