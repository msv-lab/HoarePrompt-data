Correctness: **False**

The provided function calculates the minimum difference between adjacent elements in a sorted array. However, the problem description specifically calls for finding the minimum difference between any two distinct elements in the given array, not just adjacent elements. 

For example, consider the array `[3, 7, 1]`. The minimum difference should be `1` (between `1` and `3`), but the program would return `2` (between `1` and `3` when sorted adjacent elements are considered), which is incorrect according to the problem description. 

Additionally, it is also important to note that the program improperly references `target` which is irrelevant to the calculation of the minimum difference and is not required by the problem statement. 

Thus, the function does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
