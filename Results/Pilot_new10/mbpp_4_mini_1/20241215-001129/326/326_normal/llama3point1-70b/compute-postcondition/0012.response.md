The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between the elements of `arr` at index `i` and `i + 1`, specifically `arr[2]` and `arr[3]`, since `i` is 2. The variable `min_diff` remains unchanged, and the initial state of the sorted list `arr` with at least three elements also does not change. The output will reflect that `diff` has been calculated based on the specific elements of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is unchanged, `i` is 2 and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])**
