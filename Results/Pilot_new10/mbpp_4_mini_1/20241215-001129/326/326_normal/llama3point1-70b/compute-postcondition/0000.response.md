The code `arr = sorted(arr)` takes the list `arr` of integers and sorts it in ascending order. The variable `target` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the operation. The output state will reflect that `arr` is now sorted while retaining the information of `target`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers; `target` is an integer.**
