The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents an infinite value. This indicates that `min_diff` is intended to be used for comparisons, likely to find the minimum difference in a subsequent calculation. The states of other variables, `arr` and `target`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers; `target` is an integer; `min_diff` is set to positive infinity.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers; `target` is an integer; `min_diff` is positive infinity.**
