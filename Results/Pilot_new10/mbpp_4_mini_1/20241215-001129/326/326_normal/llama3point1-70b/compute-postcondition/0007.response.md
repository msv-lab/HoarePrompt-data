According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the length of `arr`. Since `arr` has at least 2 elements, the `len(arr) - 1` expression indicates that the loop will iterate with `i` ranging from 0 to `len(arr) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been less than `len(arr) - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`. The next iteration will only occur if this new value of `i` is still less than `len(arr) - 1`.

Since `arr` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements, `len(arr)` must be at least 2, and thus `len(arr) - 1` is at least 1. If `i` was `0` at the start of the last iteration, it will become `1`, and we need `i` to be less than `len(arr) - 1`, which means:

- If `len(arr)` is `2`, then `i` would become `1`, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be `1 < 1`, which is false. So the loop won't execute again.
- If `len(arr)` is greater than `2`, let's denote it as `k`, the condition holds that `i` will become `i + 1` as long as `i + 1 < k`, thus allowing more iterations.

So, in this context, we will adjust the states based on the next appropriate loop execution. 

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is unchanged, `i` is `1`, `len(arr)` must be greater than `2`**
