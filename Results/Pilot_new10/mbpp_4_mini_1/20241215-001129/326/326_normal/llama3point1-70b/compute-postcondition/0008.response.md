The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is `1`, this means that `diff` equals `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`. The values for `arr` are not specified, but it is confirmed that `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is unchanged, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])**
