According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the array `arr`. The loop will iterate while `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop has checked the pairing of `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, which will make `i` equal to 2. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1`, so `len(arr)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is unchanged, `i` is 2**
