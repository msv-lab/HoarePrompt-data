You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((isinstance(x, int) for x in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It does this by using a generator expression that checks each element in the list to determine whether it is an instance of the `int` type. The `sum()` function then adds up the results of these checks, effectively counting how many integers are in the list.

The program covers various potential cases:
- An empty list will return `0`, which is correct since there are no integer elements.
- A list containing mixed types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, etc.) will only count the integer elements, which is the expected behavior.
- A list with only integers will return the total count of integers in the list.

Overall, I cannot think of any potential cases where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list that may contain any type of elements, and the function should count only the integer elements within that list.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the count of integer elements in the list 'lst' by summing the boolean values resulting from checking if each element is an instance of int.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` that may contain elements of any type, and it returns the count of integer elements within that list. The function does not handle cases where `lst` is not a list, nor does it account for nested lists or elements that may contain integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
