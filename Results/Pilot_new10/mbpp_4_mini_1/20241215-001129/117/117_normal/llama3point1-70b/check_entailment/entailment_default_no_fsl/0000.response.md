Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Based on the output hints, the function is expected to count the number of integer elements in a given list. However, it fails to handle cases where the input `lst` is not a list. If non-list inputs (such as an integer, string, or None) are provided, the function will raise a `TypeError`. 

Additionally, the program does not consider nested lists. For example, if `lst` contains another list with integers, the function will not count those integers. 

For example:
- Input: `func_1([1, 2, [3, 4], '5'])` should ideally return `3` (counting the integers 1, 2, and 3), but it will return `2` as it does not count integers inside the nested list `[3, 4]`.

These cases indicate that the program is incorrect.
