Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(lst)` counts the number of integer elements in the input list `lst`, which matches the specified task.

Here's a breakdown of how the function meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list (`lst`) that may contain various data types.
2. **Integer Counting**: It uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to iterate through each element in `lst` and checks if it is an integer using `isinstance(x, int)`.
3. **Output**: The function returns the total count of integer elements, which is the desired behavior as described in the problem statement.

The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves as intended for multiple test cases, leading to the conclusion that the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all tested scenarios. Therefore, the correctness is validated, and the function is correct.
