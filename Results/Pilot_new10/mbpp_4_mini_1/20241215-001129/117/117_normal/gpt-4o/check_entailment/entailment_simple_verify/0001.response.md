Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(lst)` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given list as described in the problem statement. The annotations confirm that the program's behavior is correctly aligned with the expectations based on the problem description. It efficiently checks each element of the list using `isinstance(x, int)` and counts only the integer elements. The provided assertions supporting the function's correctness under different scenarios also validate the assessment. Thus, the program fulfills the requirements as stated, and the assessment of correctness is justified.
