Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It does this by using a generator expression that checks each element in the list to determine whether it is an instance of the `int` type. The `sum()` function then adds up the results of these checks, effectively counting how many integers are in the list.

The program covers various potential cases:
- An empty list will return `0`, which is correct since there are no integer elements.
- A list containing mixed types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, etc.) will only count the integer elements, which is the expected behavior.
- A list with only integers will return the total count of integers in the list.

Overall, I cannot think of any potential cases where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
