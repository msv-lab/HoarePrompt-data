Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given list `lst`. It uses a generator expression that iterates over the elements of the list and checks if each element is an instance of an integer using `isinstance(x, int)`. It sums up the results of this expression to give the total count of integers.

The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the test cases given:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` correctly returns `2`, because there are two integers (`1` and `2`).
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` correctly returns `3`, since all three elements are integers.
3. `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` correctly returns `2`, as `1` and `4` are integers, while `1.2` and `5.1` are not.

The program correctly handles various types of inputs, such as integers, floats, and strings. No edge cases are left unaddressed, and thus the program fulfills the requirements as stated in the problem description.
