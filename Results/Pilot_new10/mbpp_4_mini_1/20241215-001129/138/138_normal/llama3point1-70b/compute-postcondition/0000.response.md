The variable `index` is assigned the result of `array.index(element)`, which finds the first occurrence of `element` in the `array`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specifically defined, but it is expected that the `element` exists in the `array` since we are calling `index` on it. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **`array` is a list of elements, `element` is in the array, and `index` is the position of `element` in `array`.**
