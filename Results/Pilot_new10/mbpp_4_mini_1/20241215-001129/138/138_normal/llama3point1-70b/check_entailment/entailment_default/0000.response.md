The program correctly attempts to locate an element in the provided array and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element was found and the index at which it is found. The use of the `index` method is appropriate since it raises a `ValueError` if the element is not present, and this is handled by the `try-except` block. 

However, the output hints indicate that the program does not handle cases where the array is empty. Specifically, if `array` is empty and we attempt to find an `element`, calling `array.index(element)` will raise a `ValueError`, leading to a return value of `(False, -1)`. While this indicates that the element is not present, it's important to recognize that, according to the description, the expected behavior of the function should explicitly account for the empty array case.

Thus, the program may not meet the specifications of the problem description, as it does not have a defined behavior for an empty array input. Therefore, it's possible that there could be an edge case that the problem description does not clarify but is implicit in functionality.

Correctness: **False**.
