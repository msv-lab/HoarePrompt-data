Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list `array` is empty. According to the problem description, it should return a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). However, if the array is empty and any element is passed, the code will raise a `ValueError`, and the catch block will execute, returning `(False, -1)` correctly. 

While that seems to fulfill the requirement, the output hints indicate that the function does not explicitly handle cases where the array is empty, suggesting that there might be some ambiguity in whether it has been considered in the logical flow. Given that edge cases should be explicitly addressed for a program to be deemed "correct," and since the description implies that it should consistently capture all scenarios without leaving out edge cases, this leads to the conclusion that the implementation is not fully trustworthy for every potential case.

Specifically, testing it with an empty array and any element will still return the expected result `(False, -1)`, but it eludes the necessity of clearly handling the empty array case in its logic as per strict interpretation of the requirements. This gives rise to doubts regarding its overall correctness across all potential inputs, thus the assessment concludes it as **False**.
