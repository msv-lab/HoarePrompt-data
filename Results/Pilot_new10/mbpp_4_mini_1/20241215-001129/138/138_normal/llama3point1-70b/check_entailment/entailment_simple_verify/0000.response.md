Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It successfully checks if an element is present in an array and returns the appropriate tuple based on whether the element is found or not. The annotated version clarifies that both scenarios (element found and not found) are handled properly, and the assessments regarding edge cases—like handling empty arrays and managing exceptions—are valid. The logic is sound, and the function adheres to the specifications provided in the problem description.
