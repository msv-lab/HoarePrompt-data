Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. It uses the list method `index` to find the position of the specified element and handles the case when the element is not found by catching the `ValueError`. The function correctly returns a tuple containing `True` and the index when the element is present, and `False` and -1 when it is not found, which aligns perfectly with the specified requirements in the problem description. The annotations clarify the state of the program before and after execution and confirm that the logic is consistent and handles the described scenarios appropriately. Overall, the implementation is correct based on the given parameters, making the original assessment valid.
