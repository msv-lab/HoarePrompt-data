You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return (True, index)
    except ValueError:
        return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes an input array and an element, checks for the presence of the element in the array, and returns a tuple indicating both the presence (as a boolean) and the index of the element (or -1 if it is not found).

The program uses the `index()` method of the list, which efficiently searches for the element and raises a `ValueError` if the element is not present. The `try-except` block is an appropriate way to handle this situation. 

Let's examine a few test cases:

1. If the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and the element is `3`, the program will return `(True, 2)` because `3` is present at index `2`.
2. If the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and the element is `5`, the program will return `(False, -1)` because `5` is not present in the array.

Additionally, the program correctly handles cases with an empty array (e.g., `func_1([], 1)` will return `(False, -1)`) and cases where the element appears multiple times (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3], 2)` will return `(True, 1)` because it finds the first occurrence). 

Considering these points, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of elements, and element can be of any type that may be present in the array.
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return True, index
        #The program returns True indicating that 'element' is found in the 'array', along with its corresponding 'index' position in the array.
    except (ValueError):
        return False, -1
        #The program returns False and -1
    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: `array` is a list of elements, and `element` can be of any type. If the `element` is found, the function returns True and the index of the element; otherwise, it returns False and -1.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
