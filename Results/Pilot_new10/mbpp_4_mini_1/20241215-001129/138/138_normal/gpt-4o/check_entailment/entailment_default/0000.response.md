The program provided correctly implements a function that searches for an element in an array and returns whether it is found along with its index. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. The function `func_1` iterates through the array `arr` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element in the array.
2. Inside the loop, it checks if the current value `value` is equal to the `element`. 
3. If it finds a match, it returns a tuple `(True, index)` where `index` is the position of the element in the array.
4. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`.

The output hints clarify that the function does work as intended, stating that it searches for the first occurrence of the `element` and correctly returns the expected result.

The examples provided in the assertions confirm that:
- For `func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31)`, the output `(True, 3)` is correct.
- For `func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61)`, the output `(True, 7)` is also correct.
- For `func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48)`, the output `(True, 6)` is indeed correct.

The output hints accurately describe the function's behavior and align with the code, confirming the function's correctness.

Thus, there are no cases where the function fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
