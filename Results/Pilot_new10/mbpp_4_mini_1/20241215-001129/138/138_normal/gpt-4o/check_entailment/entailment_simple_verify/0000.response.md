Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function checks if a specified element exists within an array and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating existence and the index of the element (or -1 if not found). 

The annotations confirm that the function properly handles both finding the element and returning the correct tuple format as specified; when the element exists, it returns `(True, index)`, and when it does not, it returns `(False, -1)`. The test cases validate that the function behaves as intended across different scenarios. Therefore, based on the annotations and provided details, the original assessment holds true.
