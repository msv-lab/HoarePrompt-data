The function accepts a list `arr` and a value `element`. It searches for the first occurrence of `element` in `arr` and returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence if found; otherwise, it returns `False` and -1. The function does not limit the search to the first three indices, contrary to what is stated in the annotations.
