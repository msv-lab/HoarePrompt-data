Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` checks if an element exists in the given array and returns a tuple with a boolean indicating presence and the index of the element (or -1 if not found). 

It correctly uses enumeration to iterate over the array, returning `(True, index)` when the element is found, and `(False, -1)` if the loop completes without finding the element. The provided test cases confirm its correctness. The function handles the cases of both present and absent elements properly, and I could not find any potential case where it would fail to follow the problem description. 

Hence, all specified requirements of the problem description are met for any potential input.
