Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes an array and an element as inputs, and it uses the `index` method of the list to find the index of the given element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index. If the element is not found, it raises a `ValueError`, which is caught, and it returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`. 

This approach handles all potential edge cases:
1. If the array is empty, the element will not be found, and the return value will be `(False, -1)`.
2. If the element is present in the array, it correctly provides `True` alongside the index of the first occurrence.
3. If the element is not present at all, it correctly provides `False` and `-1`.

Since the logic correctly handles all specified cases in the problem description, the function can be considered correct.
