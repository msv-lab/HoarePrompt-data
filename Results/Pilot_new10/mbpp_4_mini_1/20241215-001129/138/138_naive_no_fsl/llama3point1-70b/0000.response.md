Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes an input array and an element, checks for the presence of the element in the array, and returns a tuple indicating both the presence (as a boolean) and the index of the element (or -1 if it is not found).

The program uses the `index()` method of the list, which efficiently searches for the element and raises a `ValueError` if the element is not present. The `try-except` block is an appropriate way to handle this situation. 

Let's examine a few test cases:

1. If the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and the element is `3`, the program will return `(True, 2)` because `3` is present at index `2`.
2. If the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and the element is `5`, the program will return `(False, -1)` because `5` is not present in the array.

Additionally, the program correctly handles cases with an empty array (e.g., `func_1([], 1)` will return `(False, -1)`) and cases where the element appears multiple times (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3], 2)` will return `(True, 1)` because it finds the first occurrence). 

Considering these points, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.
