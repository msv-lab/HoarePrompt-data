Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program functions correctly for valid inputs based on the problem description, which specifies finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

The annotated code confirms that the primality checking function (`func_1`) correctly determines the prime status of a non-negative integer, and that the main function (`func_2`) correctly identifies the sequence of these specific primes starting with 7 and continuing with others as defined by their remainder when divided by 6.

Furthermore, the assumption that valid input will be provided (i.e., any positive integer greater than or equal to 1) aligns with the annotations indicating that the code does not explicitly handle invalid input cases. However, since it's stated that the input will be valid, the program operates as intended within the specified constraints. 

Thus, the evaluation of the correctness of the program supports the conclusion that it behaves as expected without any errors for the defined input range, fulfilling the requirements laid out in the problem description.
