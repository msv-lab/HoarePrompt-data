You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program for finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, let's analyze the code step-by-step based on the problem description.

The function `func_1(n)` checks if a number is prime. The logic seems correct; it returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility until the square root of `n`, which is standard practice for primality testing.

The function `func_2(n)` is tasked with finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. According to the logic:

1. It correctly returns 7 for `n == 1`, as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is known to be 7.
2. It uses a while loop to iterate through potential prime candidates starting from 7 and checks for primality using `func_1(n)`.
3. It also checks that the prime number is of the form 6k ± 1 (hence the check `num % 6 in [1, 5]`).
4. The counter `count` increments correctly when a prime number of the desired form is found, and it returns the number when the count matches `n`.

However, there's a potential issue with the program:

- The while loop continues indefinitely until the desired nth prime is found. If `n` is very large, this could take a significant amount of time without an upper limit on `num`. Although the implementation will eventually find the nth prime as it only requires checking numbers sequentially, there’s no built-in mechanism to handle edge cases, particularly for very large values of `n`.

Moreover, for values of `n` that are very large or values for which no valid nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime exists (if such a case were to be proposed in the domain of numbers), the program would not return a result in a timely manner or would go beyond practical limits.

Thus, while the program works for small values of `n`, the lack of handling for larger values leads to potential cases where it may not perform as expected.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns False if `n` is less than 2, indicating that it is not a prime number. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks for divisibility by all integers from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns False, implying that `n` is not prime. If `n` is not divisible by any of these integers, it returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not clearly handle negative inputs for its postconditions, but those cases are effectively excluded by the primary input requirement of non-negative integers. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find. It returns 7 if `n` is 1. For values of `n` greater than 1, it returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which may be any prime number greater than 7 that satisfies the conditions checked in the loop. The function relies on an undefined `func_1` to determine primality and checks that prime numbers are of the form 6k ± 1. The potential for infinite looping exists if `func_1` never returns true or if the conditions to increment `count` are not met. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
