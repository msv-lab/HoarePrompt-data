The code provided for the problem description of finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number has two functions.

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**: This function checks if a number is prime. The implementation correctly checks for numbers less than 2 and subsequently checks for divisibility up to the square root of `n`. Therefore, it properly identifies prime numbers as described in the problem description. 

   - The output hints accurately capture this functionality, stating that it will return False for numbers less than 2 and appropriately check divisibility for numbers 2 and above. 

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**: This function aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The implementation returns 7 for `n = 1`, which is correct according to the description. For `n` greater than 1, it initializes a count and starts from the next prime greater than 7, checking the primality of numbers and their form related to 6k ± 1.

   - However, the output hints raise a concern about the potential for infinite looping if `func_1` doesn't eventually return true or if the conditions to increment `count` are not met. Since there is no upper limit to the values of `num` being incremented, there's a risk that it could run indefinitely, especially if a valid count is never reached due to the skipped numbers not meeting the required forms (not in 6k ± 1).

The program does not account for cases where it could potentially enter into an infinite loop, which contradicts the assurance of finding the nth prime. Since it is stated that there could be infinite looping or situations where the desired nth prime cannot be reached, this leads us to conclude that the function might not behave as expected for all inputs. 

Thus, since there exists a case (when `func_1` fails to return true continuously) where the program does not yield a valid outcome as required by the problem description, the correctness of the entire program is flawed.

Correctness: **False**.
