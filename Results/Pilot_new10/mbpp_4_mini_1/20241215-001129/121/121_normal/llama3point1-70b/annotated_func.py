#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns False if `n` is less than 2, indicating that it is not a prime number. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks for divisibility by all integers from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns False, implying that `n` is not prime. If `n` is not divisible by any of these integers, it returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not clearly handle negative inputs for its postconditions, but those cases are effectively excluded by the primary input requirement of non-negative integers.

        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 11; if `func_1(num)` returns true for `num` values 8, 9, and 10, then `count` will have reached `n` once `num` becomes 11.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find. It returns 7 if `n` is 1. For values of `n` greater than 1, it returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which may be any prime number greater than 7 that satisfies the conditions checked in the loop. The function relies on an undefined `func_1` to determine primality and checks that prime numbers are of the form 6k Â± 1. The potential for infinite looping exists if `func_1` never returns true or if the conditions to increment `count` are not met.
