The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The other variables (`n`, `num`, and `func_1(num)`) remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `count`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 7, and `func_1(num)` is true. The current value of `num` satisfies the condition that `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.**
