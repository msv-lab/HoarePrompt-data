Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute indefinitely. There are no conditions that prevent it from continuing to the next iteration. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state to allow it to execute one more time.

State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, count is 2, num is 9**
