To evaluate the impact of the code on the program:

1. The code calculates `S_next` using the formula `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`.
2. Given the Initial State, we know:
   - `S0` is 1
   - `S1` is 1
3. Plugging the values into the equation:
   - `S_next = 2 * 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
4. The other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged.

The Output State reflects the new value of `S_next` while keeping the other variables' values intact.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `S_next` is 3**
