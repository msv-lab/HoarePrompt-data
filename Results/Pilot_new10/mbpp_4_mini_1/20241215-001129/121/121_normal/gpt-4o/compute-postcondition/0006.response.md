The operation `S0, S1 = S1, S_next` assigns the values of `S1` and `S_next` to `S0` and `S1`, respectively. 

Before the operation:
- `S0` is 1
- `S1` is 1
- `S_next` is 3

After the operation:
- `S0` receives the value of `S1`, which is 1
- `S1` receives the value of `S_next`, which is 3

Therefore, after the execution of the code, we have:
- `S0` remains 1
- `S1` is updated to 3

The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `S_next` is 3**
