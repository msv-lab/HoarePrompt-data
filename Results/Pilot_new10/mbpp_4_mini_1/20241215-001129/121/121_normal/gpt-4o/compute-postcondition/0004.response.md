According to the code, the loop executes as long as the variable `i` starts at 2 and goes up to `n`, inclusive. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, the loop is set to execute for values of `i` starting from 2. At the beginning of the loop:

- The initial value of `i` will be 2.
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

States related to `S0` and `S1` do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself based on the loop structure provided. They are not specified for adjustment for the purpose of the loop's execution. However, noting the current values of `S0` and `S1` is important in the context of potential processing within the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we can say:
- The value of `i` at the start of the loop will be 2.
- The integer `n` must remain greater than 1 to ensure that there are iterations for the loop to run.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1**
