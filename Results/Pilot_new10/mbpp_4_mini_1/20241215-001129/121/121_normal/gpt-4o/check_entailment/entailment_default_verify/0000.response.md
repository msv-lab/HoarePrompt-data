The original assessment accurately identifies the deficiencies in the provided program in relation to the problem description of finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. The output hints further clarify the functionality of the function `func_1`, stating that while it does return specific values for the given input cases, it does not ensure that these values are the nth prime numbers required by the problem description.

The function computes terms based on a recurrence relation without making any checks for primality or maintaining the sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes specifically. It only returns terms based on the relation rather than confirming them as primes or positioning them correctly in the desired sequence.

Given that the output hints confirm the function's logic and reinforce the idea that it merely computes terms in a sequence without ensuring their prime status, the original assessment's conclusion that the program is incorrect remains valid.

Final: **False**
