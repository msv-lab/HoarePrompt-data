Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, the function `func_1` instead computes terms of a sequence defined by a recurrence relation, which is unrelated to the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. The output hints also suggest that the function behaves differently than required.

For example, the program asserts that `func_1(3) == 7`, but based on the actual logic, `func_1(3)` is computed to be 5 as follows:
- `S(0) = 1`
- `S(1) = 1`
- `S(2) = 2 * S(1) + S(0) = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3`
- `S(3) = 2 * S(2) + S(1) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7`

However, this sequence is not aligned with the definition of the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

Furthermore, the function does not account for cases when `n` is greater than 1 correctly, explicitly missing the logic required to determine the correct sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes and the prime determination itself.

Consequently, since the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for multiple potential values of `n`, it is deemed incorrect.
