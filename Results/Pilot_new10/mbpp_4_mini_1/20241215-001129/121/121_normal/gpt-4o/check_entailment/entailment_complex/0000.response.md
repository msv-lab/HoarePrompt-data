The program provided is intended to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, upon analyzing the code and its logic, we note the following discrepancies with respect to the problem description:

1. The function does return `1` for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, which is correct since the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime for these inputs is often defined as `1`. However, it should calculate the actual prime numbers for `n > 1`.

2. For values of `n` greater than `1`, the recurrence relation used (`S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`) does not correspond to the calculation of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes as per their mathematical definition. Instead, the function seems to generate a sequence that is not aligned with the actual nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

3. The provided assertions in the program suggest expected outputs for `func_1(3)`, `func_1(4)`, and `func_1(5)`, indicating that these should yield the prime numbers `7`, `17`, and `41` respectively. However, based on the established definition of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, the function is not guaranteed to produce these values due to the incorrect recurrence relation used.

Taking into account these points, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Therefore, the final determination of the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect primarily because it does not compute the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers correctly, particularly for `n > 1`.
