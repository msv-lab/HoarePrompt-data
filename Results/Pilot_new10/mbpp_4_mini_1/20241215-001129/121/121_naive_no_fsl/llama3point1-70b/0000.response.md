To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to examine whether it accurately finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number according to the problem description.

The Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are a specific category of prime numbers, defined as follows:

1. The prime numbers begin with 7 as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.
2. Subsequent numbers must be prime and also must yield a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6.

- The function `func_1(n)` checks if a number is prime.
- The function `func_2(n)` is intended to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

**Analysis of the Code:**

1. **func_1(n)**: This function is implemented correctly in terms of checking the primality of a number.

2. **func_2(n)**:
   - It correctly initializes the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime as 7.
   - It keeps a count of how many Newman-Shanks-Williams primes have been found.
   - It then checks each successive number to see if it is both prime and satisfies `num % 6 in [1, 5]`.

Now, we need to ensure that the program works for all potential cases. 

Let's consider the input `n = 1` and `n = 2`:
- For `n = 1`, it correctly returns 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.
- For `n = 2`, it will find the next prime (which must also be of the form mentioned) and return 13, which is indeed the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

In testing further:
- For `n = 3`, it will output 19 (correctly, since it is the third such prime).
- Continuing this way, we get the sequence: 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, etc.

However, to validate the function’s robustness, let’s explore potentially problematic inputs:
- Input `n = 0`: The program does not handle this case, which should ideally return an indication of an invalid request since the 0th prime doesn't exist.
- Input `n < 1`: The function does not handle negative inputs and will lead to an infinite loop because the exit condition is determined solely by counting found primes.

Given the analysis, we observe that the program does not account for edge cases such as invalid values of `n` (like 0 or negative integers), and could potentially lead to an infinite loop or unintended behavior.

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**

This conclusion arises from the fact that the program lacks proper handling for edge cases, thus not satisfying its requirements across all potential inputs.
