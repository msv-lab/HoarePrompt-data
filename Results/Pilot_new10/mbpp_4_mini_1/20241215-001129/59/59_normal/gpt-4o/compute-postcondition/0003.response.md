The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. All three parameters are lists of integers. After executing the function body, the function returns a `sorted_list`, which is a sorted version of `combined_list` containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` combined. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of integers and return a single sorted list containing all the integers from those lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of integers, and returns a sorted list containing all elements from these three lists combined.**
