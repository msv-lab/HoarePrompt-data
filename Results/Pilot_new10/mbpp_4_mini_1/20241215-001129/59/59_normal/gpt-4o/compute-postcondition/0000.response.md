The variable `combined_list` is assigned the value of the concatenation of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Since the initial state indicates that `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of integers, `combined_list` becomes a single list containing all the integers from these lists in the order they appear. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of integers; `combined_list` is a list containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` combined.**
