Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list, adhering to the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input**: The function takes three lists of integers (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) as input, which fits the requirement of working with three lists.

2. **Merging**: The line `combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3` correctly combines the three input lists into one. This merging is performed using the `+` operator, which concatenates the lists.

3. **Sorting**: The merged list is then sorted using the `sorted()` function, which returns a new list that is ordered in ascending manner. This complies with the requirement for the output to be sorted.

4. **Output**: Finally, the function returns the sorted list, ensuring that it contains all elements from the three input lists in the correct order.

The assertion tests provided in the annotated program confirm that the function behaves as expected for various cases, resulting in correctly sorted merged lists. Given these points, the function accurately fulfills the problem description.
