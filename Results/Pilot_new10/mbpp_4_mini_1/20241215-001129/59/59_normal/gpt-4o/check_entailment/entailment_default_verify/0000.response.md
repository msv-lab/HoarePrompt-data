The original assessment accurately concluded that the program works as intended. The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists of integers and sorts them in ascending order, adhering to the problem description. The provided output hints further clarify that the function combines three lists into a single sorted list, which aligns with the program's logic and the test cases. 

In particular, the assessment evaluated various scenarios, including edge cases related to merging empty lists and lists with duplicates or negative numbers. It found that the program handles these cases correctly and that the assumptions made about valid input are appropriate, as specified.

Thus, based on the problem description, the program's implementation, and the output hints, I maintain that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
