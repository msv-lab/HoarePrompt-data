Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes three lists of integers, combines them into a single list, and then sorts that combined list in ascending order before returning it. The provided output hints match the intended behavior of the function, and the tests/assertions demonstrate that it produces the expected results for various inputs. 

The approach of using list concatenation and the built-in `sorted()` function ensures that all elements are included and sorted correctly. Furthermore, the given test cases cover potential edge cases, including negative numbers, repeated values, and varying lengths of input lists. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case outlined in the problem description.
