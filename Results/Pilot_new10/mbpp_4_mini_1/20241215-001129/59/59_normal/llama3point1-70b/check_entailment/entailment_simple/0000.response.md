Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input. It uses the expression `list1 + list2 + list3` to concatenate these lists, which creates a single list containing all the elements from the three input lists.

2. **Sorting**: The program then applies the `sorted()` function to the concatenated list. This ensures that the elements of the resulting list are in sorted order.

3. **Output**: The result of the `sorted()` function is returned, providing a single sorted list that includes all integers from the three input lists.

Every potential case, regardless of the contents or order of elements in the input lists, will yield an output that is a single sorted list as required by the problem description. Thus, the program behaves as intended and adheres to the problem's requirements.
