Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the program is correct and does not account for potential issues arising from the lack of input validation. According to the output hints, the function does not perform any checks on the input types or contents, which could lead to a TypeError if the inputs are not lists of integers. Therefore, while the program may work correctly under valid inputs, it fails to handle cases where the input assumptions are violated. This oversight means the program does not fully meet the robustness expected based on the problem description, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
