The function accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers, and returns a sorted list that is the concatenation of these three input lists. There are no checks for the types of the input parameters, so if any of the inputs are not lists or contain non-integer types, a TypeError may occur.
