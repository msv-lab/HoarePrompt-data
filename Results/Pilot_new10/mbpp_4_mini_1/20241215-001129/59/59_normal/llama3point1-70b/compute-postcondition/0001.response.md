The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. All three parameters are lists of integers. After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list that is the concatenation of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of integers and return a single sorted list that combines all the integers from the three input lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters, list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of integers, and returns a sorted list that is the concatenation of the three input lists.**
