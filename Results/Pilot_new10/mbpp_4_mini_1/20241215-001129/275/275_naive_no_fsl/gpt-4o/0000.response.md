To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic used in the `func_1` function.

The function aims to find the largest subset of numbers from the input list such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible by one another. 

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. It first checks if the input list `nums` is empty; if so, it returns 0.
2. It sorts the list `nums` in ascending order.
3. It initializes a list `dp` with the same length as `nums`, where each element is set to 1, because the smallest subset containing any single number has size 1.
4. The function then uses a nested loop:
   - The outer loop iterates over each number `i`.
   - The inner loop iterates over all previous numbers `j` with indices less than `i`.
   - It checks if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, indicating that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
   - If true, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This counts the subset size including `nums[i]`.

Finally, it returns the maximum value found in `dp`.

### Test Cases:
- `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18])` returns 4, which is correct since we can form the subset {1, 3, 6, 18}.
- `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20])` returns 3, which is correct since we can form the subset {5, 10, 15}.
- `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17])` returns 4, which is correct, forming the subset {1, 3, 6, 18}.

### Edge Cases Check:
To ensure the program is robust, let's consider the following edge cases:
1. An empty list: `func_1([])` should return 0. The code handles this correctly.
2. A list with all prime numbers: `func_1([2, 3, 5, 7])` should return 1, since no pairs are divisible.
3. A list with a single element: `func_1([10])` should return 1.
4. A case where some numbers could create larger divisible subsets: `func_1([4, 8, 16, 32])` should return 4.

In conclusion, I could not identify any potential cases where the code fails to meet the problem description for any of the inputs considered. 

Therefore, Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly finds the largest subset for the given conditions.
