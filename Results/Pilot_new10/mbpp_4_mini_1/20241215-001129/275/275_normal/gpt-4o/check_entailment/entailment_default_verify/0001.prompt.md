You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic used in the `func_1` function.

The function aims to find the largest subset of numbers from the input list such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible by one another. 

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. It first checks if the input list `nums` is empty; if so, it returns 0.
2. It sorts the list `nums` in ascending order.
3. It initializes a list `dp` with the same length as `nums`, where each element is set to 1, because the smallest subset containing any single number has size 1.
4. The function then uses a nested loop:
   - The outer loop iterates over each number `i`.
   - The inner loop iterates over all previous numbers `j` with indices less than `i`.
   - It checks if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, indicating that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
   - If true, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This counts the subset size including `nums[i]`.

Finally, it returns the maximum value found in `dp`.

### Test Cases:
- `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18])` returns 4, which is correct since we can form the subset {1, 3, 6, 18}.
- `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20])` returns 3, which is correct since we can form the subset {5, 10, 15}.
- `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17])` returns 4, which is correct, forming the subset {1, 3, 6, 18}.

### Edge Cases Check:
To ensure the program is robust, let's consider the following edge cases:
1. An empty list: `func_1([])` should return 0. The code handles this correctly.
2. A list with all prime numbers: `func_1([2, 3, 5, 7])` should return 1, since no pairs are divisible.
3. A list with a single element: `func_1([10])` should return 1.
4. A case where some numbers could create larger divisible subsets: `func_1([4, 8, 16, 32])` should return 4.

In conclusion, I could not identify any potential cases where the code fails to meet the problem description for any of the inputs considered. 

Therefore, Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly finds the largest subset for the given conditions.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if `nums` is empty. Otherwise, it computes and returns the maximum length of the longest subset of indices in `nums` such that each element at a higher index is divisible by the element at a lower index, after sorting `nums`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
