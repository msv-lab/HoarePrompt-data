To verify the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze it thoroughly.

### Problem Description
The task is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair within that subset is divisible. 

### Provided Program
```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

### Output Hints
The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and:
1. Returns 0 if `nums` is empty.
2. Computes and returns the maximum length of the longest subset of indices in `nums` such that:
   - Each element at a higher index is divisible by the element at a lower index.
   - The list is first sorted.

### Caveat in the Program Logic
1. The program does follow the general logic needed for dynamic programming to find the largest subset, incrementing the count if an element can be divided by a previous element. However, the crucial aspect of the problem is that every single pair in the subset should be divisible. 
2. The logic given currently only checks for individual divisibility which works for the subset chaining, but not efficiently ensures that all the pairs in the subset are divisible by one another.

### Output Cases
Let’s check the output cases provided with assertions:
```python
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4
```

### Examination of Potential Edge Cases
Let’s check another case:
- Example: `func_1([4, 8, 16, 32, 5])`
  - Here, the function would return `4`, but the proper answer should only consider `5` separately since `4, 8, 16, 32` work together, but they cannot create a pair with `5`.
  - The absence of a check that validates every possible pairing means this case would be incorrectly counted in this implementation.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all necessary divisibility checks across all pairs in a subset. It focuses only on a more relaxed form of divisibility which does not satisfy the full problem description that requires every pair to be divisible by each other.

Therefore, the result of our verification yields:

Correctness: **False**.
