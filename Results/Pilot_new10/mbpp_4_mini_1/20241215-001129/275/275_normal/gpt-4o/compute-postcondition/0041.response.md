Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsequences derived from `nums`, where each `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum length of divisible subsets ending at index `i`. If the loop does not execute, then `dp` remains a list of ones with each `dp[i]` equal to 1 for all indices, meaning there is no divisible relationship established among the elements in `nums`.**
