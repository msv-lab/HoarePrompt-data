According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `0` to `i-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `1` (so that the range can yield at least one value for `j`), and we need to increment `j` to the next value.

At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `i + 1` elements, meaning `j` would take values from `0` to `i-1` during this iteration. If we want the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `2` (to ensure there are at least two iterations, accessing indices as `0` and `1`).

Therefore, after the last iteration, `j` within the loop would have been `i - 1`, and for the next iteration `j` will try to be `i`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `i + 1` elements; `dp` contains the maximum lengths of divisible subsequences derived from `nums`, `j` is `i`, `i` must be at least `2`**
