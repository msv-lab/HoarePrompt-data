According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` from `0` to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`, which means the loop has executed for `j=0` during this iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `i` is at least `1`, the loop can execute again for `j=1` as long as `j` remains less than `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `2` (so `j` can be `1`), and `j` will now be `1`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` is updated; `i` must be at least 2; `j` is 1.**
