According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. Since `i` can be incremented to at least `1`, this suggests that `i` is currently at least `1`, which means the loop can potentially run for one or more iterations. However, to further clarify the state at the start of the loop, we need to ensure that `j` will start from `0`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `i` should be at least `1`, and `j` must start from `0`. Since we know `i` can be incremented, it is already at least `1`, and `j` will take these values starting from `0` in the loop.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` is updated; `i` is at least 1; `j` is 0**
