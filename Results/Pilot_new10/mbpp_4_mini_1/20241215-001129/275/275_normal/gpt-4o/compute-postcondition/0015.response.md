Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element; `dp` is updated such that if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, then `dp[i]` is set to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` for relevant indices, where `i` is at least 2 and `j` is at least `i - 1`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp` remains unchanged.***
