Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if `nums` is empty. Otherwise, it computes and returns the maximum length of the longest subset of indices in `nums` such that each element at a higher index is divisible by the element at a lower index, after sorting `nums`. **
