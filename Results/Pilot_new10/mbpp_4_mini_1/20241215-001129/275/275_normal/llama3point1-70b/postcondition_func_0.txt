The function accepts a list of integers `nums`, returns 0 if `nums` is empty, and if not, it returns the length of the longest subsequence in which each pair of elements satisfies the divisibility condition. This subsequence is determined by examining the sorted list of integers and leveraging a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum length of such subsequences.
