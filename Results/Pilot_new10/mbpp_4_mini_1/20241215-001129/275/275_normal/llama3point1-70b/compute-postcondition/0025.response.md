According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates from `0` to `i-1` with the variable `j`, which means the loop continues as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, the range for `j` is determined by the value of `i`, and `j` has been incremented towards `i`.

Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `dp` contains the respective lengths of divisible subsequences, we need `i` to be at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time. 

Given that the loop would execute for `j` from `0` to `i-1`, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and for the loop to run, `j` will then take the value of `i-1`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` contains the lengths of divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`, `i` must be at least 2**
