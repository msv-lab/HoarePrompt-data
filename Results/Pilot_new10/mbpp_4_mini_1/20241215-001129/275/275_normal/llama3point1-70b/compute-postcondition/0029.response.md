According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the list `nums` starting from 1 up to `len(nums) - 1`. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that it falls within the range of 1 to `len(nums) - 1`, and since there are at least 2 elements in `nums`, `len(nums)` is at least 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` is at position `k`, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. After the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`, and to ensure the loop continues to execute, `k + 1` must still be less than `len(nums) - 1`, meaning `len(nums)` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`; for each index `i`, `i` is equal to k + 1, where k is the previous index and `len(nums)` must be greater than k + 1**
