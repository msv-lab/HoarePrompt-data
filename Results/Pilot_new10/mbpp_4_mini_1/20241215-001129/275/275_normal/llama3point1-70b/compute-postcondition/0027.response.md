Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` contains the lengths of divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`; `i` is at least 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some valid `j` where `j < i`, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
