The `sort()` method sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. The content of `nums` is changed, but its length remains the same. No other variables are affected, so the output state will reflect the sorted state of `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.**
