Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`; for each index `i`, where `i` is in the range of 1 to `len(nums) - 1`, `dp[i]` is equal to the length of the longest divisible subsequence ending with `nums[i]`.**
