According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the range of `j`. The for loop will iterate for values of `j` from `0` to `i-1`. Currently, `i` is 2, which means the loop can execute for values of `j` equal to 0 and 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making it 1. At this point, `j` can take on the value of 1 before the loop exits, as `j` will not reach 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` remains the same at 2, and `j` needs to be set to 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
