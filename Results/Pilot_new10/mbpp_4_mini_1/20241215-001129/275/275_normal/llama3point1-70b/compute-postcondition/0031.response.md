Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`; `k` is at least 0; `i` is equal to `k + 1`, which is at least 1; `len(nums)` must be greater than `k + 1`. The current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.***
