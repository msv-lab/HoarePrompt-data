According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1, which it is in this case since `i` is 1. Therefore, the loop is set to execute for `j` in the range from 0 to `i - 1` (0 in this case). 

Since the loop is designed to run for a range defined by the value of `i`, with `i` being 1, the loop will execute exactly once (for `j = 0`). Thus, the variables `j` and how they relate to the loop iteration are already appropriately set.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` filled with the value `1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
