Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` contains the lengths of divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` (i.e., the remainder when `nums[i]` is divided by `nums[j]` equals 0).***
