According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The `for` loop runs for each value of `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, meaning `j` can take on values in the range of 0 to 0.

Since the loop has already executed for `j` equal to 0 (the only possible value), to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. Therefore, `i` will increase to 2, which will allow the loop to run with `j` taking values of 0 and 1 (0 to `i-1`).

In summary, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased to 2.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0.**
