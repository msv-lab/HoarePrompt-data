You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly identifies the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty and returns `0` if it is.
2. It sorts the list, which is useful because if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `nums[i]` must be greater than or equal to `nums[j]` when sorted. This facilitates a straightforward comparison for the dynamic programming approach.
3. The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized to `1` for each element, indicating that each number can at least form a subset of size 1 by itself.
4. The nested loops compare each pair of elements appropriately. When `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates the `dp` value for `i` to reflect the maximum size of the subset found so far.
5. Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, representing the size of the largest subset satisfying the divisibility condition.

The code effectively handles various cases, including:
- An empty input list returns `0`.
- It appropriately tracks and updates the sizes of valid subsets.
- It accounts for all pairs by iterating through all indices.

Since no edge cases or potential failure points have been identified, and the logic follows the requirements strictly, the program is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0 since the current value of `nums` is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`, and each `dp[i]` represents the maximum length of the divisible subsequence ending with `nums[i]` based on the earlier elements in `nums`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequences stored in the list `dp`, which corresponds to the longest such subsequence that can be formed with the elements of the sorted list `nums`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
