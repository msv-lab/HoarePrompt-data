Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Finding the Largest Divisible Subset**: The program defines a function that takes a list of integers (`nums`) as input and intends to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of numbers in that subset is divisible. This is the primary requirement outlined in the problem description.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The initial check (`if not nums: return 0`) appropriately addresses the edge case where the input list is empty, ensuring that the function returns 0, which is logically correct since an empty list has no subsets.

3. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the input list. This step is crucial as it allows for an organized way to check divisibility among numbers. Sorting helps ensure that when checking divisibility, we are checking pairs such that the divisor always comes before the dividend.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The `dp` array where `dp[i]` stores the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]` is correctly updated. The two nested loops iterate through the list, checking for pairs of numbers where `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. When this condition is met, `dp[i]` is updated to reflect the inclusion of `nums[i]` in a divisible subset.

5. **Maximizing the Subset Size**: The computation of `max(dp)` at the end of the function ensures that the function returns the maximum size of any valid subset found, aligning with the requirement to return the size of the largest subset.

Overall, the algorithm is effective and robust, adhering to the requirements outlined in the problem description for all possible cases, thus confirming the correctness of the implementation.
