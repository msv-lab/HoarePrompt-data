Correctness: **True**.

The provided program accurately checks whether a given expression of brackets is balanced or not. It maintains a stack to track opening brackets and checks for matching closing brackets. The function correctly handles the following scenarios:

1. If there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, it returns `False`.
2. If a closing bracket does not match the most recent opening bracket (pop from the stack), it returns `False`.
3. If all opening brackets have matching closing brackets and they are in the correct order, it returns `True`.

The program also gracefully handles edge cases such as:
- Nested brackets.
- Mixed types of brackets (i.e., `()`, `{}`, `[]`).
- An empty string, which is a balanced expression.

Thus, the function adheres to the problem description and handles all potential testing scenarios correctly.
