Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The provided function correctly implements a method to check if the given expression contains balanced brackets. 

The reasoning supported by the annotated version of the code confirmed that:
1. **Opening Brackets Tracking**: It correctly pushes opening brackets onto the stack.
2. **Closing Brackets Matching**: It effectively checks whether the last opened bracket matches with the current closing bracket by utilizing the stack.
3. **Balanced Check**: An empty stack at the end of the iteration indicates that all brackets were matched properly, confirming the expression is balanced.

The annotations reinforce that the function handles various scenarios, including nested and mixed types of brackets, and gracefully handles special cases, which aligns with the original assessment. Therefore, the program adheres correctly to the problem description and is indeed correct.
