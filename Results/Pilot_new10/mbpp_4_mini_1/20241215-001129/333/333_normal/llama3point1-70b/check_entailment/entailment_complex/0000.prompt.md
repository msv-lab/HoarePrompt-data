You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string that may contain various characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces.
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a string; `stack` is a list that contains only the opening brackets in the order they were encountered in `expression`. If `stack` is empty after the loop, `expression` contains balanced brackets. If `stack` is not empty, then `expression` contains unbalanced brackets.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if the 'expression' contains balanced brackets (i.e., stack is empty), and returns False if the 'expression' contains unbalanced brackets (i.e., stack is not empty).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `expression` and checks for balanced brackets. It returns True if all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order, and returns False if the brackets are unbalanced or if a closing bracket appears without a matching opening bracket.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
