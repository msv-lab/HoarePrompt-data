According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `expression`. If `expression` is non-empty, the loop will iterate over the characters in `expression`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the current character from `expression`, and we know that `expression` is a non-empty string. Since the loop processes each character in the string sequentially, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must advance to the next character in `expression`, and the loop must have not reached the end of the string yet.

If `expression` has `n` characters and we are currently at index `i`, then `char` will be the character at index `i`. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that we have not yet processed all characters. Therefore, `char` will move to the next character in the string, which is `expression[i + 1]`, and the index must be `i + 1`. The string `expression` will still be non-empty, but will have `n - 1` characters remaining.

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string with `n - 1` characters remaining, `char` is the character at index `i + 1`, and `stack` maintains its previous state with respect to the current character being processed.**
