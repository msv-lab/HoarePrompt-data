Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with `n - 1` characters. If `char` is in `brackets`, it will be added to the end of `stack`. Otherwise, `char` remains unchanged in terms of `stack`, and if `char` is in `brackets.values()`, the function returns False if `stack` is empty or the top of `stack` does not match `char` based on the `brackets` mapping; otherwise, the state of `stack` remains unchanged.***
