The operation `stack.append(char)` adds the character `char`, which is defined as the character at index `i + 1` of the string `expression`, to the end of the list `stack`. This changes the state of the `stack` variable by including `char`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state will indicate that `char` has been added to `stack`.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string with `n - 1` characters remaining, `char` is the character at index `i + 1`, and `stack` includes `char` at its end.**
