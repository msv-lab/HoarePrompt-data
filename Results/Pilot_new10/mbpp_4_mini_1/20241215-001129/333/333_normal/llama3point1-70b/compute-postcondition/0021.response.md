Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with `n` characters, and `char` is the `n-th` character in the string. If the stack is empty or if the popped character from the stack does not match `char` based on the brackets mapping, the function returns False. If neither of these conditions is met, there is no return value, and the execution continues.***
