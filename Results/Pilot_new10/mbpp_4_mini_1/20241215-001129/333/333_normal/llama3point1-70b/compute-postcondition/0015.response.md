Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with `n - 1` characters; `char` is the character at index `i + 1`, and `stack` maintains its previous state. If `stack` is empty or the top of the `stack` does not match `char` according to the `brackets` mapping, the function returns False, indicating a specific condition is not met based on the current processing of 'expression' and 'char'.***
