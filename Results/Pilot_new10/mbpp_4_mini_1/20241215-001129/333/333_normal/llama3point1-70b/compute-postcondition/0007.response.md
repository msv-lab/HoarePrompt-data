Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character of `expression`, `char` is not in `brackets`, and the current value of `char` is in `brackets.values()`. After executing the if condition, `stack` is still empty, and therefore there is nothing to pop, or `char` does not match the corresponding opening bracket for the character popped from `stack` (if `stack` were not empty).***
