The code `stack.append(char)` appends the variable `char` to the list `stack`. Initially, `stack` is an empty list, and `char` is the first character of the non-empty string `expression`, which is known to be in the set of brackets. After executing the code, `stack` will contain this first character. 

Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `expression` is a non-empty string, `stack` now contains the first character of `expression`, and `char` is the first character of `expression` which is in the set of brackets.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string, `stack` contains `char`, `char` is the first character of `expression` which is in the set of brackets.**
