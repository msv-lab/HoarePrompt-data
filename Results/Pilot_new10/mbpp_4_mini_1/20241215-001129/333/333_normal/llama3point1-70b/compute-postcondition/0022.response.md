Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with `n` characters, and `char` is the `n-th` character in the string. If `char` is a value in `brackets`, then if the stack is empty or the popped character from the stack does not match `char` based on the brackets mapping, the function returns False. If neither of those conditions are true, the execution continues without a return value.***
