The original assessment stated that the correctness of the function `func_1` is **True**. Upon reviewing the problem description, program details, and the output hints, the assessment appears accurate.

The program correctly implements logic to check if parentheses, brackets, and braces in a given string are balanced, handling various inputs logically. Each of the provided test cases is designed appropriately and yields the correct results, confirming the accuracy of its functioning as described.

Additionally, the output hints clarify that the function overlooks any characters that are not brackets but still operates correctly within the confines of what is expected (only checking brackets). As per the original reasoning, the function does return `True` when all brackets are matched and `False` when there are unmatched brackets.

Since all tests, edge cases, and the primary logic of the program align with the problem description, I find that the original assessment is justified.

Final: **True**
