Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the problem description of checking if the given expression is balanced in terms of parentheses, brackets, and braces. Here’s how the program satisfies the requirements in detail:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a string `expr` as input, which may contain parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, braces `{}`, and other characters. According to the problem description, every opening bracket should have a corresponding closing bracket and they must be correctly nested. The program correctly processes a string input that includes non-bracket characters by ignoring them.

2. **Use of a Stack**: The function utilizes a stack data structure to ensure each opening bracket has a matching closing bracket. When it encounters an opening bracket (either `(`, `[`, or `{`), it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket (either `)`, `]`, or `}`), it checks if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack matches the expected opening bracket using the `matching_pairs` dictionary. This procedure effectively confirms that the brackets are both matched and correctly nested.

3. **Return Value**: After iterating through the string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. An empty stack indicates that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets in the correct order. Returning `True` in such a case aligns with the problem description's requirement that the function should indicate if the expression is balanced. Conversely, if there are unmatched opening brackets remaining in the stack, it returns `False`, which correctly indicates an unbalanced expression.

4. **Coverage of Cases**: The function has been verified with several assert test cases, which check for various scenarios:
   - A perfectly balanced expression (`'({})[]'`) returns `True`.
   - An unbalanced expression with mismatched brackets (`'({]'`) returns `False`.
   - Nested and concatenated balanced expressions (`'{}[]{}()'`) return `True`.

Since the function correctly implements the task it sets out to do—checking the balance of brackets in the string input—it adheres to the problem description without any oversight or error.

In conclusion, the program correctly checks for balanced brackets and operates as intended for all provided input types according to the problem description. Thus the correctness is affirmed.
