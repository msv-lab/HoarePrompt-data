Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to check if a given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, brackets, and braces. 

### Explanation:
1. **Bracket Matching Logic**: The function maintains a stack to track opening brackets (`(`, `[`, `{`). It uses a dictionary `matching_pairs` to define the relationship between closing and opening brackets.

2. **Iteration Over Characters**: As the function iterates over each character in the input string `expr`:
   - It pushes opening brackets onto the stack.
   - For each closing bracket, it checks if there is a corresponding opening bracket at the top of the stack. If the stack is empty (indicating no unmatched opening brackets), or the closing bracket doesnâ€™t match the last opened bracket, it returns `False`.

3. **Final Stack Check**: After processing all characters, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is empty, all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, and thus the expression is balanced, returning `True`. If the stack is not empty, it means there were unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns `False`.

### Test Cases:
- `func_1('{()}[{}]')` returns `True` because all brackets are correctly matched.
- `func_1('{()}[{]')` returns `False` because the last bracket is unmatched.
- `func_1('{()}[{}][]({})')` returns `True` as every bracket has a matching counterpart.

The function comprehensively covers the requirements of verifying balanced expressions as outlined in the problem description, handling all matching and nesting scenarios effectively. Therefore, the program is correct.
