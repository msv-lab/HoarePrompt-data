Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and if `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, `char` is added to `stack`. If `stack` is empty or the character popped from `stack` does not match `matching_pairs[char]`, the function returns False; otherwise, it proceeds without a return value.***
