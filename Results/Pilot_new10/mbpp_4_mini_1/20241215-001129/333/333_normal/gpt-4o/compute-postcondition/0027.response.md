Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `expr` that may contain various characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces. It checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and that they are correctly nested. The function returns True if all pairs of brackets are matched correctly, or False if there are unmatched brackets or if a closing bracket does not correspond to the last unmatched opening bracket. It does not account for any unmatched characters other than brackets, which means any non-bracket characters are ignored during the matching process. **
