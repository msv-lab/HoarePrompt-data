Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and the function returns False if the stack is empty or if the character popped from the stack does not match the corresponding character in `matching_pairs` for `char`. If the condition does not hold, no specific return value is defined.***
