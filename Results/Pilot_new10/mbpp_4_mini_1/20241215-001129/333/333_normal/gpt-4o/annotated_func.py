#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string that contains characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces, and may also include other characters.
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expr` is a string consisting of characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces; `stack` is empty if `expr` is valid (all pairs matched), otherwise it contains unmatched opening brackets; the matching pairs of brackets are stored in `matching_pairs`.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True if 'stack' is empty, indicating that all pairs of brackets in the expression 'expr' are matched; otherwise, it returns False if 'stack' contains unmatched opening brackets.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `expr` that may contain various characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces. It checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and that they are correctly nested. The function returns True if all pairs of brackets are matched correctly, or False if there are unmatched brackets or if a closing bracket does not correspond to the last unmatched opening bracket. It does not account for any unmatched characters other than brackets, which means any non-bracket characters are ignored during the matching process.
