To find the volume of a triangular prism, we need to follow the standard formula, which states that the volume \( V \) is given by:

\[
V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length}
\]

For a triangular prism, the area of the base (which is a triangle) can be calculated using:

\[
\text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base Length} \times \text{Height}
\]

Combining these formulas, the volume can be expressed as:

\[
V = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \times l
\]

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
```

This function correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula described above. The input parameters \( b \), \( h \), and \( l \) represent the base length, height, and length of the prism, respectively.

However, we need to check if there are any edge cases or inputs that the function does not handle correctly:

1. If any of the inputs \( b \), \( h \), or \( l \) are negative, the function will still return a numerical result, which does not make sense in the context of physical dimensions for a prism. The volume should not be negative, so this is a potential flaw.
  
2. If \( b \) or \( h \) are zero (which is a valid edge case for the dimensions of a triangle where it effectively becomes a line), the calculated volume will also be zero. This is mathematically correct, but does not imply that the prism has any volume.

Based on these considerations, since the program does not properly handle cases where the dimensions can be negative, and thus could potentially return an incorrect volume (or not relevant as physical dimensions), we can conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**.
