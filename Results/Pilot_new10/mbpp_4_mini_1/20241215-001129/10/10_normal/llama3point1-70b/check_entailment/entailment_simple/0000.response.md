Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the provided formula \( \text{Volume} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \right) \times \text{length} \).

Hereâ€™s why the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1(b, h, l)` takes three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`, which correspond to the base, height, and length of the triangular prism, respectively. The problem specifically describes these as positive floats.

2. **Volume Calculation**: The calculation inside the function uses the correct formula for the volume of a triangular prism:
   - First, it computes the area of the triangular base using the formula \( \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \).
   - Then, it multiplies the area of the triangular base by the length \( l \) of the prism, which is \( \left( \text{Area} \right) \times l \).

3. **Output**: The function returns the computed volume, which aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements to find the volume of a triangular prism.

Since the implementation adheres to the problem description without any deviations or omissions, it is correct.
