Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle edge cases where the inputs `b`, `h`, or `l` are not positive floats. The problem description states that the function requires these parameters to be positive, but there is no validation in the code. If any of these parameters are negative or non-float types, the formula would still execute, possibly leading to incorrect results or runtime errors. For example, if we call `func_1(-1, 2, 3)`, the function would still return a value, which does not represent the volume of a triangular prism since all dimensions must be positive.
