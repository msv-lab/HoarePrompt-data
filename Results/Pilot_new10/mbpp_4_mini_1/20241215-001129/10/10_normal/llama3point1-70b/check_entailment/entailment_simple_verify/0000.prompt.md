You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Program:
```
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l


```
Original Assessment: To find the volume of a triangular prism, we need to follow the standard formula, which states that the volume \( V \) is given by:

\[
V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length}
\]

For a triangular prism, the area of the base (which is a triangle) can be calculated using:

\[
\text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base Length} \times \text{Height}
\]

Combining these formulas, the volume can be expressed as:

\[
V = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \times l
\]

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
```

This function correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula described above. The input parameters \( b \), \( h \), and \( l \) represent the base length, height, and length of the prism, respectively.

However, we need to check if there are any edge cases or inputs that the function does not handle correctly:

1. If any of the inputs \( b \), \( h \), or \( l \) are negative, the function will still return a numerical result, which does not make sense in the context of physical dimensions for a prism. The volume should not be negative, so this is a potential flaw.
  
2. If \( b \) or \( h \) are zero (which is a valid edge case for the dimensions of a triangle where it effectively becomes a line), the calculated volume will also be zero. This is mathematically correct, but does not imply that the prism has any volume.

Based on these considerations, since the program does not properly handle cases where the dimensions can be negative, and thus could potentially return an incorrect volume (or not relevant as physical dimensions), we can conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a positive float representing the base of the triangular prism, h is a positive float representing the height of the triangular prism, and l is a positive float representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated using the formula (base * height / 2) * length, where b is a positive float representing the base, h is a positive float representing the height, and l is a positive float representing the length of the prism.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
