You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Program:
```
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l


```
Original Assessment: To find the volume of a triangular prism, we need to follow the standard formula, which states that the volume \( V \) is given by:

\[
V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length}
\]

For a triangular prism, the area of the base (which is a triangle) can be calculated using:

\[
\text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base Length} \times \text{Height}
\]

Combining these formulas, the volume can be expressed as:

\[
V = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \times l
\]

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
```

This function correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula described above. The input parameters \( b \), \( h \), and \( l \) represent the base length, height, and length of the prism, respectively.

However, we need to check if there are any edge cases or inputs that the function does not handle correctly:

1. If any of the inputs \( b \), \( h \), or \( l \) are negative, the function will still return a numerical result, which does not make sense in the context of physical dimensions for a prism. The volume should not be negative, so this is a potential flaw.
  
2. If \( b \) or \( h \) are zero (which is a valid edge case for the dimensions of a triangle where it effectively becomes a line), the calculated volume will also be zero. This is mathematically correct, but does not imply that the prism has any volume.

Based on these considerations, since the program does not properly handle cases where the dimensions can be negative, and thus could potentially return an incorrect volume (or not relevant as physical dimensions), we can conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts three parameters, `b`, `h`, and `l`, which are expected to be positive floats representing the base, height, and length of a triangular prism. It calculates and returns the volume of the prism using the formula \((b \times h / 2) \times l\). However, although the function requires all inputs to be positive, there is no validation in the code to ensure that `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive floats, which could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors if negative values or non-float types are passed. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
