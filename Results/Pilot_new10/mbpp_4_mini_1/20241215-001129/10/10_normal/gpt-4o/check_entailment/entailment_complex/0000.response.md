Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Validation of Inputs**: The problem description does not explicitly state the need for validation; however, it implies that the inputs should be positive floats or integers. The provided function lacks any checks for negative or zero values, which could result in incorrect computations or misleading outputs if someone inadvertently calls the function with such values.

2. **Function Output for Invalid Cases**: If the function is called with a base, height, or length of zero or negative values, the calculation will provide a volume, which would be incorrect according to the problem's expectations that all values must be positive. For instance, calling `func_1(-1, 2, 2)` would yield a volume of `-1`, which does not make sense in the context of a physical volume.

3. **Business Logic**: While the calculation `0.5 * base * height * length` does correctly compute the volume of a triangular prism when given proper positive input values, the lack of error handling for negative or zero inputs means the function is not robust against invalid user input.

Due to these reasons, the function does not adhere strictly to its intended purpose as defined in the problem description.
