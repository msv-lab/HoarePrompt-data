You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(10, 8, 6) == 240
assert func_1(3, 2, 2) == 6
assert func_1(1, 2, 1) == 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: base is a positive float or integer representing the area of the triangular base, height is a positive float or integer representing the height of the triangular prism, and length is a positive float or integer representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(base, height, length):
    base_area = 0.5 * base * height
    volume = base_area * length
    return volume
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism, which is equal to 0.5 * base * height * length
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: base, height, and length, all of which should be positive floats or integers. It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula 0.5 * base * height * length. There are no checks for negative or zero values for the parameters, which could lead to incorrect computations or intuitions if called with invalid inputs.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
