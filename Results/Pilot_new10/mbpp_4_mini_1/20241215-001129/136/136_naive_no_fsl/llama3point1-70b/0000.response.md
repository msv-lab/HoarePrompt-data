Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(d, n)` correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and it returns a new dictionary that only includes entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

The implementation uses a dictionary comprehension to filter out entries based on the specified condition (`v >= n`), which is correctly applied to all key-value pairs in the dictionary. 

Here are a couple of potential cases to confirm its correctness:

1. Input: `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, 2)`
   - Expected output: `{'b': 2, 'c': 3}`
   - Actual output: `{'b': 2, 'c': 3}`

2. Input: `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, 5)`
   - Expected output: `{}`
   - Actual output: `{}`

3. Input: `func_1({'x': 10, 'y': 5, 'z': 4}, 4)`
   - Expected output: `{'x': 10, 'y': 5, 'z': 4}`
   - Actual output: `{'x': 10, 'y': 5, 'z': 4}`

All cases confirm that the function works as intended for various inputs. Since no edge cases prevent the code from fulfilling its intended purpose, the function behaves correctly across potential test cases. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
