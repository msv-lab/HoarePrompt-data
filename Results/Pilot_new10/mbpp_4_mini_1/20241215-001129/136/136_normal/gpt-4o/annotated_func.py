#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where the keys are of any immutable type and the values are integers, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary where the keys are from dictionary d and the values are integers that are greater than or equal to n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d`, where the keys are of any immutable type and the values are integers, along with an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only those entries from `d` where the associated values are greater than or equal to `n`. If `d` is empty, the function will return an empty dictionary.
