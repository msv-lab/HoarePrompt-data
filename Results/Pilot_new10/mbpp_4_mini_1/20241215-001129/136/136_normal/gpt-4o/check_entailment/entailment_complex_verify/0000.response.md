Based on the provided problem description, the program correctly implements the functionality to filter a dictionary based on the specified integer `n`. The function `func_1` creates a new dictionary using dictionary comprehension, ensuring that only entries with values greater than or equal to `n` are included.

The given assertions test the function with multiple cases, confirming that the outputs match the expected results. The function's definition and accompanying annotations further clarify that it handles valid inputs correctly:

1. The inputs passed to `func_1` in the assertions are all dictionaries with integer values, as stated in the annotations.
2. The function operates as intended by returning a dictionary filtered based on the conditional specified.

The original assessment declaring the correctness of the program as **True** aligns with the behavior of the code and the problem requirements. The annotated version reaffirms that the function works correctly under the assumption of valid inputs, which doesn't change the initial evaluation.

Final: **True**
