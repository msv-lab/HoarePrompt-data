Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` indeed filters the input dictionary `d` to include only those entries where the values are greater than or equal to the integer `n`. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program and confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a new dictionary with the correct key-value pairs. 

The function handles valid inputs appropriately, including edge cases such as empty dictionaries, all of which align with the problem description. Therefore, I agree with the original assessment that the function operates correctly under the assumptions provided.
