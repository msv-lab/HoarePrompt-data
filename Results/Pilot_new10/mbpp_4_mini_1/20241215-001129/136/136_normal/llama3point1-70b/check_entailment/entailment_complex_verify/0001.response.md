After reviewing the problem description, the program implementation, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, here is the evaluation:

1. **Problem Description**: The function is required to filter a dictionary based on whether its values are greater than or equal to a given integer `n`.
  
2. **Program Logic**: The provided function `func_1` correctly iterates through the dictionary and builds a new dictionary that includes only those key-value pairs for which the value meets the condition `v >= n`. 

3. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment stated that the correctness is **True**, meaning the function is deemed correct in fulfilling the requirement specified.

4. **Annotated Version**: The annotated code agrees with the original assessment by clearly stating that the function accepts a dictionary and an integer, and explains what the function does, confirming it returns the expected result based on the input criteria.

Considering all of this, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function has been verified through reasoning and examples, demonstrating its capability to handle various scenarios appropriately.

Final: **True**
