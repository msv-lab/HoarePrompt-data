Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code provided meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function that iterates through the input dictionary `d` and constructs a new dictionary using a dictionary comprehension. The condition `v >= n` ensures that only entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n` are included. If no entries meet this criterion, the function correctly returns an empty dictionary. 

The output hints further confirm the functionality of the code, stating that it correctly filters the dictionary based on the values, which aligns with the problem description. Given these considerations, the implementation of the function is correct.
