Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(d, n)` correctly implements the specified requirements of the problem description. It filters the input dictionary `d` to include only entries with values that are greater than or equal to the integer `n`. The output hints confirm that the function is designed to handle this specific input and behavior, and the example cases provided in the assessment also validate the function's correctness. The implementation correctly produces the expected outcomes for various input scenarios. Therefore, based on the provided information, the program is indeed correct.
