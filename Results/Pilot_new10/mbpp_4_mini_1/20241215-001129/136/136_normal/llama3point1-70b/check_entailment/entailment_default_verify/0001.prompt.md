You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n.
Program:
```
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(d, n)` correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and it returns a new dictionary that only includes entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

The implementation uses a dictionary comprehension to filter out entries based on the specified condition (`v >= n`), which is correctly applied to all key-value pairs in the dictionary. 

Here are a couple of potential cases to confirm its correctness:

1. Input: `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, 2)`
   - Expected output: `{'b': 2, 'c': 3}`
   - Actual output: `{'b': 2, 'c': 3}`

2. Input: `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, 5)`
   - Expected output: `{}`
   - Actual output: `{}`

3. Input: `func_1({'x': 10, 'y': 5, 'z': 4}, 4)`
   - Expected output: `{'x': 10, 'y': 5, 'z': 4}`
   - Actual output: `{'x': 10, 'y': 5, 'z': 4}`

All cases confirm that the function works as intended for various inputs. Since no edge cases prevent the code from fulfilling its intended purpose, the function behaves correctly across potential test cases. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a dictionary `d` with hashable keys and integer values, along with an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. If no values meet this criterion, the function will return an empty dictionary. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
