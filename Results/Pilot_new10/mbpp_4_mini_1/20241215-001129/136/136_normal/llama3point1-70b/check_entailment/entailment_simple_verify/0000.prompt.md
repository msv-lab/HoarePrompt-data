You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n.
Program:
```
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary `d` to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to the integer `n`. The dictionary comprehension iterates over all key-value pairs in the dictionary, performing the comparison for each value. Since it handles all potential inputs and edge cases (including an empty dictionary or negative values of `n`), the function operates as described in the problem statement. 

For example:
- For an input dictionary `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}` and `n = 2`, the result would be `{'b': 2, 'c': 3}`, which is the expected behavior.
- For an empty dictionary `{}` and any `n`, the output would remain `{}`, which is also correct behavior.

Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem statement in all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary with any hashable type as keys and integers as values, n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing the keys from 'd' with values that are greater than or equal to the integer 'n'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
