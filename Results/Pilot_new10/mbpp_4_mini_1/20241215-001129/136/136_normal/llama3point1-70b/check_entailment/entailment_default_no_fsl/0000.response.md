Correctness: **True**

The program implements the functionality as described in the problem statement accurately. It takes a dictionary and an integer, and it filters the dictionary to include only those entries where the values are greater than or equal to the specified integer. The output hints correctly summarize the behavior of the function, indicating that the function will return a new dictionary (which might be empty if no values meet the criteria) and does so using dictionary comprehension.

The edge case where no values meet the threshold is correctly handled by returning an empty dictionary. Therefore, for all potential cases outlined in the problem description, the code functions as expected.
