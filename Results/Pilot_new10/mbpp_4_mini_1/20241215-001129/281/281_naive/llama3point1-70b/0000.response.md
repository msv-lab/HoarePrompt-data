Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension that iterates through each number in the input list and checks if it is even (i.e., if `num % 2 == 0`). This will work for any integer input list, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. Since the logic is sound and accounts for all potential cases of evenness (any integer that is divisible by 2), the implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
