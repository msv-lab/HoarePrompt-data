Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description, which is to identify even numbers from a list of integers. It does so by defining a function `func_1` that accepts a list called `numbers`.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each element (`num`) in the `numbers` list, checking if it is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. If the condition is true (meaning the number is even), it is included in the new list that the function returns. 

This implementation will accurately collect all even integers from any list of integers passed to it and return a list containing only those even integers. Consequently, the program follows the problem description effectively and reliably.
