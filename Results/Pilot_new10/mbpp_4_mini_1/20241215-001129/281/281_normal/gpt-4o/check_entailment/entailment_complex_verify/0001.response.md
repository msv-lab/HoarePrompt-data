Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The function `func_1` effectively iterates through the provided list and applies the condition `num % 2 == 0` to identify even numbers. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function behaves as described, returning a list of even integers from the input list. Since the input is assumed to be valid (a list of integers), the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description without any logic flaws or missing edge cases.
