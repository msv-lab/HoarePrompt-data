Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes two lists as inputs, finds the common elements between them, and returns them as a sorted tuple. 

### Examination of the Logic:
1. **Finding Common Elements**: The program converts both lists into sets and uses the intersection operator (`&`) to find common elements. This correctly identifies shared elements.
2. **Sorting**: The common elements are then sorted and returned as a tuple. This ensures that the output is in the required format as specified in the problem description.
3. **Handling Duplicates**: By using sets, any duplicates in the original lists are automatically handled, as sets only contain unique items.

### Test Cases:
All of the provided assertions check a variety of cases:
- Both lists having common elements (`(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`) returns `(4, 5)`.
- Lists with one common element also work as expected.
- The function handles larger numbers and different combinations correctly.

### Conclusion:
All tested cases satisfy the problem description. Moreover, since I cannot find any example input where the program does not function as described, the implementation works correctly for the stated requirements. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
