Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements from the two lists provided as input, using the intersection of sets. It converts both lists to sets, which effectively removes duplicates and allows for efficient computation of shared elements. The program will work correctly for all typical cases, including those with:
1. Lists containing duplicate elements.
2. Empty lists, where the function should return an empty tuple.
3. Lists with no shared elements, where it should return an empty tuple as well.
4. Lists containing distinct types that are still comparable.

Since I cannot think of any scenarios where the implementation would fail to meet the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct.
