Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the shared elements between two lists. The program's use of sets to compute the intersection is efficient and handles various cases well as described in the problem assessment, including handling duplicates and returning an empty tuple when there are no shared elements or when the inputs are empty lists. The annotations provided further affirm that the program behavior aligns with the initial assessment, confirming its correctness given the assumptions about valid input.
