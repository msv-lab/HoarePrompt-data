Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements of the problem description by finding the shared elements between the two provided lists. The use of set intersection effectively handles duplicates and returns a tuple of the unique shared elements.

The annotated code clarifies that the function is functioning as expected: it takes valid lists as inputs and correctly returns a tuple of their intersection. Additionally, the annotations confirm that the function can handle edge cases like empty lists by returning an empty tuple, which aligns with the original assessment that no edge cases or failures were identified in the logic of the code. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided annotations, the program is indeed correct.
