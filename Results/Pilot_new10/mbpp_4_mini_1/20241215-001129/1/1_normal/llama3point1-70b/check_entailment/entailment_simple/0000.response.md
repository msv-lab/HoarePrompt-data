Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description, which is to find the shared elements from two given lists. 

Here's an explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are expected to be lists.

2. **Finding Shared Elements**: The function converts both lists into sets using `set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)`. The intersection of these two sets, which represents the shared elements, is calculated using the `&` operator.

3. **Output Format**: The result of the intersection operation is returned as a tuple, fulfilling the requirement to provide shared elements in tuple format.

4. **Correctness**: For all potential cases, whether the lists are empty, have no common elements, or have multiple shared elements, the function will accurately return the shared elements between the two lists as a tuple. This matches the problem description's requirements.

Therefore, the implementation adheres to the provided problem description, and thus the conclusion is that the program is correct.
