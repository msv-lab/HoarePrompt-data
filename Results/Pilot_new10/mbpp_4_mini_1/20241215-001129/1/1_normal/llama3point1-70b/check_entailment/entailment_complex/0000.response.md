Correctness: **True**

The program correctly accomplishes the task outlined in the problem description, which is to find the shared elements from two given lists. 

Here's an explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, both of which are required to be lists, as specified in the annotations.

2. **Intersection Calculation**: The program converts both lists into sets using `set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)`. The intersection of these two sets is calculated using the `&` operator, which correctly identifies elements that are present in both lists.

3. **Returning a Tuple**: The result of the intersection is then converted back into a tuple using `tuple(...)`. This is consistent with the function's requirement to return a tuple containing the shared, unique elements from the two input lists.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: If either list is empty, the intersection will also be empty, leading to an empty tuple being returned. If there are no common elements, the same logic appliesâ€”an empty tuple will be returned as specified in the annotations.

In summary, the function adheres to the problem description in all cases, including scenarios where one or both of the lists are empty or where there are no shared elements. Therefore, it correctly fulfills the specified task of finding and returning the shared elements in tuple form.
