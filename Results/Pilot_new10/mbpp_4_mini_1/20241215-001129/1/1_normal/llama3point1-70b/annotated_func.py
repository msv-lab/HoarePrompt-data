#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are lists.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the intersection of the elements from the lists `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` (both expected to be lists), and returns a tuple containing the intersection of the unique elements from these two lists. If either of the lists is empty or if there are no common elements, the function will return an empty tuple.
