You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)
assert func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)

def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes two lists as inputs, finds the common elements between them, and returns them as a sorted tuple. 

### Examination of the Logic:
1. **Finding Common Elements**: The program converts both lists into sets and uses the intersection operator (`&`) to find common elements. This correctly identifies shared elements.
2. **Sorting**: The common elements are then sorted and returned as a tuple. This ensures that the output is in the required format as specified in the problem description.
3. **Handling Duplicates**: By using sets, any duplicates in the original lists are automatically handled, as sets only contain unique items.

### Test Cases:
All of the provided assertions check a variety of cases:
- Both lists having common elements (`(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`) returns `(4, 5)`.
- Lists with one common element also work as expected.
- The function handles larger numbers and different combinations correctly.

### Conclusion:
All tested cases satisfy the problem description. Moreover, since I cannot find any example input where the program does not function as described, the implementation works correctly for the stated requirements. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)
assert func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists, which may contain elements of any data type.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the elements present in both 'list1' and 'list2', sorted in ascending order.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
