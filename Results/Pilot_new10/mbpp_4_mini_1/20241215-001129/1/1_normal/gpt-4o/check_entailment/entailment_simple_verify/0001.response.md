Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program meets the problem description by correctly identifying shared elements between the two input lists and returning them in a sorted tuple. The annotated version of the code confirms that the logic implemented within the function works as intended. All provided assertions pass successfully, demonstrating that the function handles various cases appropriately, including lists of differing contents and sizes. The use of sets effectively manages duplicates, ensuring the output contains only unique common elements. Therefore, the program functions correctly for the specified requirements.
