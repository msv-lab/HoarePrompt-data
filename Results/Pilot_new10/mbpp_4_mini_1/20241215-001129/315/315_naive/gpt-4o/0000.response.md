Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly appends the elements of the given tuple to the end of the provided list, as demonstrated by the test cases. The method `lst + list(tpl)` correctly combines the list and the converted tuple. The examples provided show that the outputs match the expected results, and there are no edge cases or missing logic based on the problem description. Thus, the implementation adheres to the problem's requirements.
