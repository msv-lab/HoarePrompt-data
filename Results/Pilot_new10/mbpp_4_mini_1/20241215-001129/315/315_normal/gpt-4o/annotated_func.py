#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and tpl is a tuple.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #The program returns a new list that is the concatenation of the list 'lst' and the elements of the tuple 'tpl' converted to a list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl` converted to a list. There are no edge cases or missing logic in this implementation; it correctly handles empty lists and tuples as well, resulting in the appropriate concatenated output.
