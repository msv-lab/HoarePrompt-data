Correctness: **True**

The program correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes a list and a tuple as inputs and concatenates them properly. The assertions provided confirm that the function works as intended for the tested cases. Additionally, based on the output hints, the implementation appropriately handles empty lists and tuples, returning the correct concatenated result in those instances as well. Therefore, it meets the specifications outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.
