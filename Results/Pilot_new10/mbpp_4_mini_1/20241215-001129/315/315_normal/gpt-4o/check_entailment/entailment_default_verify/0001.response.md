Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of concatenating a list `lst` with a tuple `tpl` by converting the tuple into a list. The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that it produces the expected outputs for the specified inputs, confirming its correctness. Additionally, the output hints reinforce that there are no unhandled edge cases regarding the types of inputs, as the function behaves correctly even for empty lists and tuples. Thus, the implementation meets the problem's requirements satisfactorily.
