Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as arguments and concatenates them, creating a new list that includes all elements from `lst` followed by all elements from `tpl`. The implementation correctly converts the tuple to a list before concatenation. 

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for a variety of inputs. The output hints indicate that the function handles empty lists and tuples well, resulting in appropriate outputs, confirming that the implementation follows the problem description for all potential cases.

Since there are no examples or scenarios where the function fails to meet the stated requirements, the function is indeed correct.
