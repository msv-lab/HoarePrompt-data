Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description, which is to add the given tuple to the given list. 

Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst, tpl)` takes two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `tpl`, which is a tuple. This matches the input requirements of adding a tuple to a list.

2. **Concatenation Logic**: Inside the function, the operation `return lst + list(tpl)` achieves the desired outcome. It converts the tuple `tpl` into a list and then concatenates it with `lst`. 

3. **Correctness of Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests that validate the functionality. Each assertion checks the output of the function against the expected result, confirming that the concatenation works as intended with different inputs.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function is capable of handling cases where the list or tuple may be empty, due to the nature of list concatenation in Python. For example:
   - If `lst` is `[]` and `tpl` is `(1, 2)`, the output will be `[1, 2]`.
   - If `lst` is `[1, 2]` and `tpl` is `()`, the output will be `[1, 2]`.
   - If both are empty (`[]` and `()`), the output will be an empty list `[]`.

Thus, the implementation provided in the program follows the problem description correctly and effectively handles all cases as described. Therefore, it is deemed correct.
