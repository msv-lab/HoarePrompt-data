Final: **True** 

The original assessment of correctness is accurate based on the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality of adding the elements of a tuple to a list, adhering to all specified edge cases mentioned in the justifications. The output hints confirm that while the function does not explicitly handle errors or input validation, it is built with the assumption that inputs will always be correct and valid as per the problem description. This means the cases handled by the function do align correctly with the expectations outlined in the description.
