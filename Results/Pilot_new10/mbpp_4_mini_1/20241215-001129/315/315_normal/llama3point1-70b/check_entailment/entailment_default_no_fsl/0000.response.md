Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not validate the types of the inputs. It assumes that the `input_list` is a list and `input_tuple` is a tuple without any checks. If the inputs are not of the correct types, the program will raise a `TypeError` or return unexpected results. 

For example:
- If `input_list` is a string (`"hello"`) and `input_tuple` is a tuple (`(1, 2, 3)`), the program will fail with an error since you cannot concatenate a string and a list created from a tuple.

This lack of type validation leads to the program potentially not working correctly for inputs that don't adhere to the expected types. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description in every potential case.
