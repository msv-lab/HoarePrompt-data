Correctness: **False**

The program does not satisfy the problem description. While the function takes a list and a tuple as inputs, it does not modify the given list by adding the tuple's elements to it. Instead, it returns a new list that concatenates the existing list with the elements of the tuple converted to a list. 

The problem description specifically states to "add the given tuple to the given list," which implies that the original list should be modified (i.e., to perform an in-place addition) rather than return a new list. A correct implementation would need to modify `input_list` directly, for instance using the `list.extend()` method or the `+=` operator. Therefore, since the function generates a new list rather than updating the original one as per the problem description, the program is incorrect.
