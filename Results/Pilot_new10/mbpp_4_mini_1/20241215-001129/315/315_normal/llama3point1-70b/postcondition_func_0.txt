The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and the elements of `input_tuple` converted to a list. No edge cases or errors are handled, such as validating the input types. The function assumes both inputs are of the correct type (list and tuple).
