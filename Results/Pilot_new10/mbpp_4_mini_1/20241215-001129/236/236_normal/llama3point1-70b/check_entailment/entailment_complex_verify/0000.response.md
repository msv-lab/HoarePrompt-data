Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The function `func_1(nums)` correctly determines whether the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. The annotations clarify that the function will return `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise. Since the problem description requires checking if a specified list is sorted, and the function meets this requirement while handling valid inputs as stated, there are no edge cases or missing functionalities that compromise the program's correctness. Therefore, the assessment that the program is correct stands validated.
