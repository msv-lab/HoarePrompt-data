The function accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns True if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the list contains fewer than 2 elements, it automatically returns True since there are not enough elements to determine an order. If any pair of adjacent elements in the list violates the sorted condition (i.e., if `lst[i] > lst[i + 1]` for any `i`), the function returns False.
