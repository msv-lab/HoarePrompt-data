Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(lst)` correctly determines if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing each element to the next one. Based on the problem description, the function is designed to handle all valid cases, including edge cases like empty lists and single-element lists. The annotated version of the code confirms the function's logic and its expected behavior, clearly stating that it will return `True` for sorted lists, `False` when a sort violation is detected, and that it will return `True` if the list contains fewer than 2 elements. Therefore, the reasoning in the original assessment holds true, and no discrepancies were found based on the annotations.
