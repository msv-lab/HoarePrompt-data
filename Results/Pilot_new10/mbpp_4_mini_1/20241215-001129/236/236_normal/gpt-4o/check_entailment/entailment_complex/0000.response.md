The provided program defines a function `func_1` that checks if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The assertions test various cases to verify the correctness of the function.

Here is the step-by-step evaluation of the program against the problem description:

1. The function takes a list `lst` as input and iterates through its elements from the first to the second-to-last element.
2. During iteration, it compares each element with the next one (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`).
3. If any element is found that is greater than the following element, the function returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
4. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it then returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.
5. The function also implicitly handles the case where the list has fewer than 2 elements, by directly returning `True`, since an empty list or a single-element list is considered sorted.

The assertions provided confirm that:
- The function returns `True` for a properly sorted list.
- The function returns `False` for lists that violate the sorted condition.
- The function handles lists of varying lengths correctly, including cases with less than 2 elements.

Since the function meets all requirements of the problem description—specifically, it correctly identifies whether a given list is sorted—the output for the correctness evaluation is:

Correctness: **True** 

This indicates that the program follows the problem description accurately, as it checks whether any adjacent elements violate the sorted condition and handles edge cases appropriately.
