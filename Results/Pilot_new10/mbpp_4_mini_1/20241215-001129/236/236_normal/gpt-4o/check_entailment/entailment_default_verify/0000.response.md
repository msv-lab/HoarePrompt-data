The original assessment states that the function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks if the input list is sorted in non-decreasing order, and explains the workings of the function with examples. The assessment concludes that the implementation is correct.

After reviewing the provided code, the problem description, and the output hints, we can confirm the following:

1. The function correctly returns `True` for sorted lists, as evidenced by the first assertion provided in the code.
2. The function correctly identifies unsorted lists by returning `False` when it finds any adjacent pairs that violate the sorted order.
3. The output hints clarify that lists with fewer than 2 elements should automatically return `True`, which aligns with standard definitions of sorted lists. Although this behavior was not explicitly tested in the assertions, it logically aligns with the function's design.
4. The assertions cover various cases, including different scenarios of sorted and unsorted lists.

Since the code does indeed fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description, and the behavior of the function aligns with the expectations set forth in the original assessment, I find it accurate.

Final: **True**
