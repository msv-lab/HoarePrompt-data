Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to determine if a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The provided assertions confirm that the function returns the expected results for both sorted and unsorted lists.

The annotations in the code effectively explain the states of the program at different points, confirming that the input list is treated as a comparable collection, and the implementation correctly identifies if the list is sorted. Additionally, the handling of edge cases, such as lists with fewer than two elements, reinforces that the function operates correctly in all anticipated scenarios under the assumption of valid input.

Given these evaluations, I find no discrepancies that would warrant a change in the correctness assessment. Thus, the program is indeed correct in accordance with the problem description.
