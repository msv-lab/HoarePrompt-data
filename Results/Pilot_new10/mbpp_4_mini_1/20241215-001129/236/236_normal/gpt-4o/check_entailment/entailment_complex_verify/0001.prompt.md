You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` effectively checks if a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If any element is greater than the following one, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it completes the loop without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

The provided assertions correctly evaluate the function's output for different lists:
- The first list is sorted and returns `True`.
- The second list has elements out of order and returns `False`.
- The third list also has elements out of order and returns `False`.

Furthermore, various edge cases such as empty lists `[]` or lists with a single element `[1]` would still return `True`, as an empty list or a single-element list is inherently sorted.

Given that I cannot find any potential case where the program does not function as described, the function is correct for the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be compared, such as integers or strings.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared, and it is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute; if the list has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and remains with no return value.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list `lst`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order and contains at least 2 elements, has passed the conditions for execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns True if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the list contains fewer than 2 elements, it automatically returns True since there are not enough elements to determine an order. If any pair of adjacent elements in the list violates the sorted condition (i.e., if `lst[i] > lst[i + 1]` for any `i`), the function returns False.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
