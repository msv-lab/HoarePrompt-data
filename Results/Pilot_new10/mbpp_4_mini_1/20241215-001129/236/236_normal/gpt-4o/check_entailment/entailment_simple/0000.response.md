Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly defines a function `func_1(lst)` that checks whether a specified list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function iterates through the list and compares each element to the next. If it finds any element that is greater than the following element, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

The program handles edge cases as follows: 
1. If the list contains fewer than two elements, the loop does not execute, and the function correctly returns `True` because an empty list or a single-element list can be considered sorted.
2. The assertions provided test various scenarios, including completely sorted lists, lists with one occurrence of being out of order, and lists that are not sorted at all.

Since the function meets all specifications in the problem description and correctly identifies sorted and unsorted lists, we can conclude that the program is correct.
