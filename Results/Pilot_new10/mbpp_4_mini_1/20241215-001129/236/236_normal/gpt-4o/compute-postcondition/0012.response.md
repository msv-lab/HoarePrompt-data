The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared, such as integers or strings. The function checks various conditions based on the elements of the list:

- Case 1: If the first element of `lst` is greater than the second element, the function returns False.
- Case 2: Under certain unspecified conditions, the function may return False.
- Case 3: Again, under different unspecified conditions, the function may return False.
- Case 4: If the list `lst` is confirmed to be sorted in non-decreasing order and contains at least 2 elements, the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and determine if it is sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, returning True if it is sorted and False otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of elements. It returns True if lst is sorted in non-decreasing order and contains at least 2 elements; otherwise, it returns False.**
