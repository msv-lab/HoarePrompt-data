Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(nums)` checks whether the input list `nums` is sorted by comparing it to a new list created by sorting `nums`. If `nums` is equal to its sorted version, then it is indeed sorted; otherwise, it is not. The function handles all cases, including empty lists and lists with one or more elements. It correctly identifies sorted and unsorted lists according to the provided problem description. Therefore, no edge cases exist that would cause the program to fail in its correctness.
