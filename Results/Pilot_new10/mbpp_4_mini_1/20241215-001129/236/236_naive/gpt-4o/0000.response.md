Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether the specified list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. If no such case is found, it returns `True`. 

Here are explanations for the provided assertions:

1. For the input `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`, the function returns `True` because the elements are in non-decreasing order.
2. For the input `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`, the function correctly returns `False` because `20` is followed by `17`, which is a violation of the sorted order.
3. For the input `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`, the function again returns `False` because `15` is followed by `14`, again indicating a violation of the sorted order.

The function properly accounts for all scenarios, including edge cases, such as lists with only one element or empty lists, which are considered sorted by definition. Therefore, the implementation is correct.
