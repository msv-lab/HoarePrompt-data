Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

The function `func_1(arr)` does the following:
1. It computes the minimum value in the array using `min(arr)`.
2. It computes the maximum value in the array using `max(arr)`.
3. It calculates the difference between these two values with `max_val - min_val`.

This approach correctly identifies the maximum difference because the difference will always be the highest when subtracting the smallest element from the largest element in the array.

The assertions provided cover various scenarios:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum is `1`, the maximum is `5`, and thus the difference is `4`, which matches the assertion.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `9`, leading to a difference of `8`, which is also correct.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `3`, resulting in a difference of `2`, consistent with the assertion.

All handled cases correctly follow the problem description, and no missing edge cases appear based on the provided logic. 

Thus, the code is overall correct in its implementation for the given problem.
