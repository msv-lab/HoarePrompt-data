Final: **False** 

The original assessment was accurate. It identified that the program does not handle the edge case of an empty array, which would lead to a `ValueError` when calling `max()` or `min()` on an empty list. The function's failure to manage this case prevents it from meeting the problem's requirement, which was to find the maximum difference for any given array. The output hints also correctly note that an error would occur if the input list is empty. Thus, the program is indeed not correct for all potential input scenarios.
