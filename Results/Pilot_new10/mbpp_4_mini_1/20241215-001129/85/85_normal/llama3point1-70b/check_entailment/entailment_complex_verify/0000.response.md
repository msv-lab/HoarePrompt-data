Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program is correct and does not properly address the issue of handling an empty array. While the function does correctly calculate the maximum difference between elements when valid input is provided, it fails to handle the edge case of an empty list. The annotations clearly indicate that calling `max()` or `min()` on an empty list will raise a `ValueError`, which contradicts the claim of correctness in the original assessment. 

Thus, the program cannot be considered correct because it will raise an error when it encounters an empty input, which is a valid edge case that should be addressed based on the standard interpretation of handling arrays in functions.
