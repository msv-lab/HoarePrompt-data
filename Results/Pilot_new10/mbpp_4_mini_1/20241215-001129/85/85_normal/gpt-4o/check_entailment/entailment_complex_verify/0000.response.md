Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but the annotated version of the code reveals potential issues that were not addressed. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle edge cases where the input array is empty or contains non-integer values. While the problem description assumes valid input, the behavior of the program in these cases is undefined, which means it cannot be deemed completely correct. The program's behavior under such conditions would lead to exceptions, thus resulting in a failure to meet the problem requirements comprehensively. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is not accurate.
