#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the maximum difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list 'arr', which is equal to max_val - min_val
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the maximum difference between the maximum value and minimum value in the list. It does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains non-integer values, which could lead to errors. Therefore, if `arr` is empty, the behavior is undefined, and if it contains non-integers, it will raise an exception.
