The value of `max_diff` is assigned the result of `max_val - min_val`. The values of `min_val` and `max_val` determine the value of `max_diff`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect the calculated value of `max_diff` based on the minimum and maximum values of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value of `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `arr`, and `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`.**
