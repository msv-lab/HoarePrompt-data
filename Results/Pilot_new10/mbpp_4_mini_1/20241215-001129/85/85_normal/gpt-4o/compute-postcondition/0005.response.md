Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the maximum difference between the maximum value and minimum value in the list. It does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains non-integer values, which could lead to errors. Therefore, if `arr` is empty, the behavior is undefined, and if it contains non-integers, it will raise an exception.**
