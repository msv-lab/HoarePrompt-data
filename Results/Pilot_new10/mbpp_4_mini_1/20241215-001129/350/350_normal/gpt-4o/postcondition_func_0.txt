The function accepts a list of sorted integers `arr` and an integer `x`, returning the index of `x` in `arr` if it exists. If `x` is not found, the function returns -1. The function efficiently searches from the end of the list to the beginning and handles cases where `arr` is empty or `x` is not present.
