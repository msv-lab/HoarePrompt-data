Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array in reverse order (from the last index to the first index) and checks if the current element is equal to the target element `x`. 

Hereâ€™s why the implementation is correct:

1. **Searching for the Last Occurrence:** By iterating backwards through the array, the function guarantees that the first occurrence it finds of the element `x` will indeed be the last occurrence in the original sorted array. This approach effectively meets the problem description's requirement.

2. **Returning the Correct Index:** If the element `x` is present in the array, the index of the last occurrence is returned immediately. If the loop completes without finding `x`, the function correctly returns `-1`, indicating that `x` is not in the array.

3. **Test Cases:** The provided assertions test various scenarios:
   - In the first assertion, `1` is present at index `0` in `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correctly returned.
   - In the second assertion, `1` is present at indexes `0`, `1`, and `2` in `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. The last occurrence is correctly at index `2`.
   - In the third assertion, `3` is present at indexes `2` and `3` in `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]`, and the function correctly returns `3` for the last occurrence.

In summary, the function satisfies the conditions of the problem description across all tested cases, confirming its correctness.
