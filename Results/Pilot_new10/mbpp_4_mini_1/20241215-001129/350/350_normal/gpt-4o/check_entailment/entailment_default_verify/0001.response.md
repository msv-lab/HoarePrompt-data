The original assessment states that the program correctly identifies the last position of an element in a sorted array, including handling various edge cases. The implementation of the function `func_1` iterates through the sorted array from the end to the beginning, returning the first index where it finds the target element `x`, or `-1` if `x` is not found.

The output hints confirm the function's main behavior: it accepts a list of sorted integers and an integer `x`, returning the index of `x` if it exists, or `-1` if it does not. It also mentions that the function handles cases where the array is empty or where `x` is not present.

After careful review, I find that the original assessment was accurate. The function indeed covers the required functionality and handles edge cases correctly, as evidenced by the tests provided.

Therefore, keeping the original assessment stands correct since:
1. The function correctly returns the last index of `x`.
2. It successfully handles cases where `x` is not in the list, duplicates, and empty lists.

Final: **True**
