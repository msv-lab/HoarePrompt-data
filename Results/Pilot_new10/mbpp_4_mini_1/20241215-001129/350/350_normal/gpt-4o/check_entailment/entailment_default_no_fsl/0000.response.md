Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. The assertions provided in the code verify the expected behavior for multiple test cases, confirming the correct index of the last occurrence of the element in different scenarios. 

The function iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, returning the index of the first match it finds, which corresponds to the last occurrence in a sorted array. Additionally, the function correctly returns -1 if the element is not found or if `arr` is empty.

The output hints also align with the implementation, confirming that the function correctly handles the specified requirements and cases mentioned in the problem description. Overall, the function satisfies all edge cases, and thus, I consider the correctness of the code verified.
