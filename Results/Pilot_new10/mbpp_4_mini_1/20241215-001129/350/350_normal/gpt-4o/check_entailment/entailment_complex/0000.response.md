Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It searches for the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. 

Hereâ€™s why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function receives two parameters, `arr` (a list of sorted integers) and `x` (an integer), which align with the problem description.

2. **Finding the Last Position**:
   - The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, which is appropriate for finding the last occurrence of `x` in a sorted list.
   - When it finds `x`, it immediately returns the index `i`, which is the last position of `x` in the list.

3. **Return Value**:
   - If `x` is found, the function returns the correct index.
   - If `x` is not found, the function returns `-1`, indicating the absence of `x` in `arr`, which is the expected behavior.

4. **Coverage of Cases**:
   - The provided assertions serve as test cases, validating the correctness of the function with different scenarios, including:
     - Finding `x` at the beginning of the list.
     - Finding the last occurrence of `x` in a list with duplicates.
     - Searching for `x` in a list where it appears multiple times.

The function behaves as specified in the problem statement for all potential cases outlined, which confirms that it is correct.
