According to the code, the for loop will execute over the range generated by `len(arr) - 1` to `-1`, decrementing by 1. The loop will execute if `len(arr)` is at least 1, which means `arr` must not be an empty list. In the state given, `arr` is a list of sorted integers, but we need to ensure that it has at least one integer for the loop to execute successfully. 

At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to `len(arr) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the array. If `arr` has elements, `i` will sequentially decrement to 0.

State: **`arr` must have at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`**
