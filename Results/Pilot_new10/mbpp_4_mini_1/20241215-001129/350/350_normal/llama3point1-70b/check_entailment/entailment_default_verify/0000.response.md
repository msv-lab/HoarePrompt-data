Final: **False**

The original assessment was not accurate because the output hints point out that the function does not handle cases where the input list `arr` might be empty. While the function will return -1 in such a case (which is correct), the assessment claims it "covers all edge cases," which implies comprehensive handling of input variations. The lack of explicit handling of an empty list or potential exceptions means that the function does not fully conform to rigorous correctness standards in practical use cases, even if it produces the correct output for valid and defined inputs. Therefore, it's more appropriate to conclude that the function is not correct in the sense of being robust to all expected conditions.
