According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is used to iterate through the indices of the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, indicating that it is pointing to the second-to-last element of the array. Since the loop is set to continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should decrease by 1.

The new value for `i` will be `len(arr) - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `len(arr) - 3`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:

1. `i` must be decreased by 1, resulting in `i` being `len(arr) - 3`.
2. The function has not specified any other return conditions for this iteration, so we will keep this state as it is.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 3`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`.**
