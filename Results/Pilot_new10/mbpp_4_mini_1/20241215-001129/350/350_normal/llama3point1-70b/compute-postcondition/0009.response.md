Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element, and `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 3`. If `arr[i]` equals `target`, the function returns `i`, indicating it is the index of the third last element in the list. If `arr[i]` does not equal `target`, no value is returned.***
