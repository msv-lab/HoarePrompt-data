Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, and if `target` is found, the function would have returned the index of the target in `arr`; otherwise, the loop completes without finding the target, and no value is returned. If the loop does not execute, `arr` can be empty, and `target` remains the initial integer.**
