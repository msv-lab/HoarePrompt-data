Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 2`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`. If the element at index `i` is equal to `target`, the function returns the index `i`. If it is not, there is no return value specified.***
