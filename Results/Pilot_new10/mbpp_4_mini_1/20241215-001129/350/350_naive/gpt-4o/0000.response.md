Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of a given element `x` in the sorted array `arr`. It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, returning the index of the last occurrence of `x` or `-1` if `x` is not found.

The assertions given as test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for various scenarios:
- When `x` is the first element in the array (e.g., `1` in `[1, 2, 3]`), it correctly returns `0`.
- When `x` appears multiple times at the start of the array (e.g., `1` in `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`), it returns the last position `2`.
- When `x` appears in between other numbers (e.g., `3` in `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]`), it properly returns the last instance `3`.

All potential cases seem to be handled correctly, and no edge cases violate the specification of finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. Hence, the program is correct.
