#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative numbers representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the area of the rectangle calculated as length multiplied by width, where length and width are non-negative numbers representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative numbers, `length` and `width`, and returns the area of a rectangle calculated as the product of `length` and `width`. Note that if either `length` or `width` is zero, the area will also be zero, which is a valid output representing a degenerate rectangle.
