The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `length` and `width`. Both `length` and `width` are non-negative numbers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying `length` by `width`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative numbers `length` and `width`, and return the area of the rectangle calculated as the product of these two dimensions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters length and width, both non-negative numbers, and returns the area of the rectangle computed as length multiplied by width.**
