Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the calculation of the area of a rectangle using the formula `length * width`. The output hints confirm that the function accepts two non-negative numbers, `length` and `width`, and returns the area calculated as the product of these two values. Since the hint states that if either `length` or `width` is zero, the area will also be zero, this aligns perfectly with the mathematical principles behind rectangle area calculation. Thus, the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs, including edge cases where either length or width is zero.
