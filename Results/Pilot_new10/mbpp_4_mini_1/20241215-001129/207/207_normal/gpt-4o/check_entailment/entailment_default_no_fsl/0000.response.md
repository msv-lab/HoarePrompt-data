Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where either `length` or `width` is negative or of an incorrect type (e.g., a string). According to the output hints, the function should accept two non-negative numbers, but the implementation does not include validation for these conditions. 

For example:
- If we call `func_1(-5, 10)`, the function would return -50, which is incorrect in the context of calculating the area as both parameters are expected to be non-negative. 
- Similarly, if we call `func_1('10', 5)`, the function would raise a TypeError since it attempts to multiply a string with an integer.

These are cases where the function does not meet the problem requirements, thus indicating that the program is not correct.
