Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` is intended to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width. However, the assertion statements that check the correctness of the function are placed before the function's definition, which means that the function `func_1` is not defined at the time the assertions are made. This will lead to a `NameError` when attempting to run the asserts.

For example, the first assertion `assert func_1(10, 20) == 200` will fail because `func_1` is not yet defined. Thus, the program as a whole will not execute correctly.

Furthermore, even if the assertions were placed after the function definition, the function `func_1` itself will return valid areas for positive lengths and widths. Nonetheless, the implementation's calling order is incorrect, resulting in an overall failure of the program to satisfy the problem description.
