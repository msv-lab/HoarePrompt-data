Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the problem description because it only removes spaces (i.e., `' '` characters) from the string, but it does not remove other types of whitespace characters such as tabs (`'\t'`), newlines (`'\n'`), or other Unicode whitespace characters. The problem description specifies the need to remove all whitespaces from a string, which includes all forms of whitespace, not just spaces. 

For example, the input string `"Hello\tWorld\n"` would not be fully processed correctly by this function, as it would still retain the tab and newline characters after execution. Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirement as specified in the problem description.
