#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')
    #The program returns the string 's' with all spaces removed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns the string with all spaces removed. It does not handle any other types of strings or special cases such as handling leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive spaces specifically, but it effectively removes all space characters.
