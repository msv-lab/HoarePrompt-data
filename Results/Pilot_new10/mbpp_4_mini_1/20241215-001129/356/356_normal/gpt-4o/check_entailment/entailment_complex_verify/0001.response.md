Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. While the program does remove space characters (' '), it fails to address other types of whitespace characters such as tabs ('\t') and newlines ('\n'). The problem description requires the removal of all whitespaces from a string, which encompasses more than just spaces. The logic and annotations confirm that the function only removes spaces and does not adequately fulfill the requirement of the problem description. Therefore, the program is deemed incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases of whitespace removal.
