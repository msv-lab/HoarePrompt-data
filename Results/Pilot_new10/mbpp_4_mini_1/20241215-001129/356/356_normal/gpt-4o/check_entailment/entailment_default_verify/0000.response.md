Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but it overlooked the fact that the function `func_1` only removes spaces and does not remove other whitespace characters like tabs (`\t`) and newlines (`\n`). The problem description requires the function to remove all whitespaces, which includes spaces, tabs, and newlines. The output hints also confirm this limitation in the function's behavior, which means it does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the assessment of correctness should be marked as false.
