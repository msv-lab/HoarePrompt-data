Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1(s)` effectively removes all spaces from the input string `s` by using the string method `replace(' ', '')`, which replaces all occurrences of a single space with an empty string. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected by removing spaces from various strings with different arrangements of white spaces. The output hints also align with the code's functionality by stating that the function accepts a string and returns it with all spaces removed. Since there are no conditions where the function fails given the problem description, it is correct for all potential cases.
