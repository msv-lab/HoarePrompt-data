The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **False** because it does not handle all potential whitespace characters, specifically tabs ('\t') and newlines ('\n'), which are types of whitespace that the problem description implies should also be removed.

The annotated code confirms that the function `func_1(s)` only replaces single spaces (' ') and not other types of whitespace. Thus, it indeed fails to meet the requirement to remove all whitespaces from a string, since it will leave tabs and newlines intact. 

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate because the program does not fully implement the requirement as stated in the problem description.

Final: **False**
