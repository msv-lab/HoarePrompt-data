Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number. The reasoning provided in the original assessment corresponds with the annotated version of the code. The function successfully evaluates the sum of the digits of `n` raised to the power of the number of digits and checks if this sum is equal to `n`. 

The annotations clarify that the input is assumed to be a valid non-negative integer and that the function returns `True` if `n` is an Armstrong number and `False` otherwise. The test cases included also confirm the program's expected outputs are correct. Therefore, the function works as intended according to the problem description.
