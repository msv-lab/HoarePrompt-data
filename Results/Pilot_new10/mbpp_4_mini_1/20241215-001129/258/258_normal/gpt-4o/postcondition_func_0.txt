The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is an Armstrong number. It calculates the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`, and returns `True` if this sum equals `n`, and `False` otherwise. The function correctly handles any non-negative integer, including single-digit numbers which are always Armstrong numbers.
