Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to check whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number, as specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Definition of Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The provided program adheres to this definition.

2. **Parameter Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `num`, which aligns with the specification that the input must be a non-negative integer.

3. **String Representation**: The function converts the integer `num` into its string representation `num_str`, which allows it to easily iterate over each digit in the number.

4. **Calculating Digit Count**: The number of digits in `num` is computed using `len(num_str)` and stored in `num_len`, facilitating the required exponentiation of each digit.

5. **Digit Processing**: The for loop iterates through each character in `num_str`, converts each character back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and accumulates this in the variable `sum`.

6. **Final Comparison**: After the loop, the function checks if `sum` is equal to `num` and returns `True` if they are equal (indicating that `num` is an Armstrong number) or `False` otherwise.

Thus, the implementation effectively checks each condition required for identifying an Armstrong number, fulfilling the problem description accurately for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
