Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements a function to check whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number. The annotations confirm that all critical variables (`num`, `num_str`, `num_len`, and `sum`) are correctly initialized and computed. The logic for calculating whether a number is an Armstrong number aligns with the definition provided in the problem description and supports all edge cases discussed. Since no flaws in the implementation are identified in the annotations nor the logic, the assessment of correctness remains valid.
