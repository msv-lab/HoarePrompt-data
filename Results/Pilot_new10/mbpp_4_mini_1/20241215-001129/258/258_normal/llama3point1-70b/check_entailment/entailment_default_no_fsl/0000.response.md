Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for determining whether a given non-negative integer `num` is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is defined such that the sum of its digits, each raised to the power of the total number of digits, equals the number itself.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the function works:

1. The function converts the input number to a string to facilitate easy digit extraction.
2. It calculates the length of the string representation, which corresponds to the number of digits in the original number.
3. It initializes a variable `sum` to accumulate the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits.
4. The function iterates over each digit, converting it back to an integer, raising it to the power of `num_len`, and adding it to `sum`.
5. Finally, it checks if the calculated `sum` is equal to `num` and returns the result as a boolean value.

Since the code follows the logic correctly and is expected to return `True` for Armstrong numbers (like `153`, `370`, `371`, `407`), and `False` for non-Armstrong numbers (like `100`, `200`, `300`), it fulfills the requirements of the problem description accurately for all potential cases. There are no identified edge cases or logic missing based on the provided description and output hints.
