`num_str` is assigned the string representation of `num`. Since `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` will be a string that represents that non-negative integer. The state of the other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`.**
