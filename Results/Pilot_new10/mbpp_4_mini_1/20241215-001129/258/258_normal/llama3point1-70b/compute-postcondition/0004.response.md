To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the pre-existing conditions and how the code alters those conditions.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `num` is a non-negative integer (≥ 0)
   - `num_str` is the string representation of `num`
   - `num_len` is at least 1 (equal to the length of `num_str`)
   - `sum` is 0

2. **Code Analysis**:
   ```
   sum += int(digit) ** num_len
   ```
   - The code effectively takes each `digit` from `num_str`, converts it to an integer using `int(digit)`, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and then adds this result to `sum`.
   - The variable `sum` will now reflect the accumulation of each digit raised to the power of `num_len`.

3. **Impact**: 
   - `sum` will be updated with the total of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`. It is critical to note that every `digit` (assuming iteration through each character in `num_str`) will contribute to `sum`, modifying its previous value of 0.

4. **Calculation**:
   - Since `num` is non-negative and has a length of at least 1, `num_str` contains valid numeric characters (0 through 9).
   - The new value of `sum` will be the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.

5. **Output State**:
   - Given that the exact values of `num`, `num_str`, and `num_len` after the execution of the code depend on specific digit computations that were not initially provided, we express the relation quantitatively.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer (≥ 0), `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is at least 1 (equal to the length of `num_str`), `sum` is equal to the sum of each integer value of the digits in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
