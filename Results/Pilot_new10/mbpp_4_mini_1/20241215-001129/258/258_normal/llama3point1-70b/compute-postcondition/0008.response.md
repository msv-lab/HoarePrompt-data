In the given code snippet, `sum` is updated by adding the result of the expression `int(digit) ** num_len`, which means the integer value of `digit` is raised to the power of `num_len`. Since `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is updated to represent this number with at least one more digit, and `num_len` is at least 2, it is implied that `digit` is a valid single digit (0-9). The current value of `sum` will be increased by this specific power calculation.

After the execution of the code:
- `sum` will be updated to its previous value plus `int(digit) ** num_len`.
- The values of `num`, `num_str`, and `num_len` will remain unchanged except for possibly the implications about `num_str`, which will reflect a larger number with additional digits.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer (â‰¥ 0), `num_str` is the string representation of `num` updated to have at least one more digit, `num_len` is at least 2, and `sum` is updated to `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`.**
