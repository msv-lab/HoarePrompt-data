#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns cube_sum which is equal to the sum of cubes of the even numbers from 2 to 2*n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of all even numbers from 2 to 2*n. It does not handle the case of `n` being negative since `n` is specified as a non-negative integer, which means no additional error handling is necessary. The function computes `even_numbers` as a list of first `n` even numbers and sums their cubes.
