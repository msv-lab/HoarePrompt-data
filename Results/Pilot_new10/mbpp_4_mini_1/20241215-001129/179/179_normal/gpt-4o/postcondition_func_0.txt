The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of all even numbers from 2 to 2*n. It does not handle the case of `n` being negative since `n` is specified as a non-negative integer, which means no additional error handling is necessary. The function computes `even_numbers` as a list of first `n` even numbers and sums their cubes.
