The variable `cube_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the cubes of all elements in the list `even_numbers`. The list `even_numbers` contains even numbers from 2 to `2 * n`, inclusive. Therefore, `even_numbers` can be expressed as the list `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2 * n]`. The values in `even_numbers` will be `2, 4, 6, ..., 2 * n` which consist of `n` even numbers.

The cube of each number in this list can be computed as follows:

- For `x = 2`, the cube is `2 ** 3 = 8`.
- For `x = 4`, the cube is `4 ** 3 = 64`.
- For `x = 6`, the cube is `6 ** 3 = 216`.
- ...
- For `x = 2 * n`, the cube is `(2 * n) ** 3 = 8 * n ** 3`.

As such, the total `cube_sum` becomes the sum of each of these cubes. Therefore, `cube_sum` will hold the value of the sum of cubic values of these even numbers.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `even_numbers` is a list of even numbers from 2 to `2 * n`.

Since `even_numbers` is calculated from `n`, it remains valid. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `even_numbers` is a list of even numbers from 2 to `2 * n`, and `cube_sum` is equal to the sum of cubes of the elements in `even_numbers`.**
