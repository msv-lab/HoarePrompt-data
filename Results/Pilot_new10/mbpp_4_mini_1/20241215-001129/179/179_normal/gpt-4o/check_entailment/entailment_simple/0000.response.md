Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement of the problem description, which is to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. Here's how the program meets the criteria:

1. **Even Natural Numbers Generation**: The list comprehension `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]` generates the first n even natural numbers. For example, for `n = 3`, it correctly generates the list `[2, 4, 6]`.

2. **Cube Calculation**: The expression `sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` computes the sum of the cubes of these even numbers. This correctly calculates the cube of each number in the list, which is necessary to meet the requirements.

3. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns `cube_sum`, which is the total sum of these cubes, fulfilling the function's purpose as described in the problem statement.

The assertions provided also check the correctness of the function for specific cases, confirming that the outputs are as expected:
- `func_1(2)` calculates the cube sum of the first 2 even natural numbers (2 and 4), resulting in \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
- `func_1(3)` would generate (2, 4, 6) and sum their cubes to get \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
- `func_1(4)` would compute the sum of cubes of (2, 4, 6, 8) leading to \(72 + 512 = 800\).

Given that the function correctly identifies the even numbers and calculates their cubes appropriately, it adheres to the requirements set out in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
