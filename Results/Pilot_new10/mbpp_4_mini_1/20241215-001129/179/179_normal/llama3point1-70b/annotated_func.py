#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
    #The program returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to 2*n, inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to 2*n, inclusive. There are no edge cases regarding the value of `n` as it is defined to be non-negative.
