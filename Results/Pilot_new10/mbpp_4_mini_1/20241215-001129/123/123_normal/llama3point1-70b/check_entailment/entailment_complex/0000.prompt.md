You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, L):
    return lst[:L], lst[L:]
    #The program returns a tuple containing the first L elements of the list 'lst' and the remaining elements starting from index L, where L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, returning a tuple containing the first `L` elements of the list and the remaining elements starting from index `L`. The function correctly handles cases where `L` is 0, returning all elements in the second part of the tuple, or where `L` equals the length of `lst`, returning an empty second part of the tuple. It does not handle the case where `L` is negative (but this is already constrained by the function parameters in the comments).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
