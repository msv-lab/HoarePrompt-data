Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately states that the program correctly splits the list into two parts based on the given integer L. The annotations reinforce this by confirming that L is a non-negative integer within the valid range (0 <= L <= len(lst)), and that the function utilizes Python's list slicing to correctly return the desired tuple. The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when L exceeds the length of the list or is 0, by returning appropriate splits as described in the original assessment. Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description effectively.
