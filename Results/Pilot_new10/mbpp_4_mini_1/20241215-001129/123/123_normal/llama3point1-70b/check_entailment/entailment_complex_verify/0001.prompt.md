You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to evaluate whether it adheres to the problem description. The function is expected to split a list `lst` into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`, and it should return these two parts as a tuple.

### Let's analyze the behavior of the program:

1. When `L` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`:
   - The function will return the first `L` elements of the list as the first part, and the remaining elements as the second part. This behavior is correct as it fulfills the requirement of splitting the list.

2. When `L` is greater than the length of `lst`:
   - The code still uses slicing `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`.
   - `lst[:L]` will return the entire list since `L` exceeds the length of `lst`, and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list.
   - In this case, it still produces a tuple, but it does not maintain the length of the first part being exactly `L` since that part is equal to `len(lst)`.

3. Edge case when `L` is negative:
   - In Python, if `L` is negative, slicing `lst[:L]` will return an empty list, and `lst[L:]` will still behave unpredictably depending on the length of `lst`. It does not conform correctly to the initial requirements as the length of the first part cannot be negative.

Given these scenarios, the function does not handle the case when `L` is greater than the length of the list appropriately, nor does it handle negative values for `L`. Thus, we have identified potential cases where the code does not behave as described.

Correctness: **False** 

Example of failure: 
- Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` would give `([1, 2, 3], [])` instead of returning a valid tuple that adheres to the rule of splitting with the first part being exactly `L`.
- Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], -1)` would give `([], [1, 2, 3])`, which does not meet the expected behavior as the first part should not be negative.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, L):
    return lst[:L], lst[L:]
    #The program returns a tuple containing the first L elements of the list 'lst' and the remaining elements starting from index L, where L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, returning a tuple containing the first `L` elements of the list and the remaining elements starting from index `L`. The function correctly handles cases where `L` is 0, returning all elements in the second part of the tuple, or where `L` equals the length of `lst`, returning an empty second part of the tuple. It does not handle the case where `L` is negative (but this is already constrained by the function parameters in the comments).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
