Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list and an integer `L` and splits the list into two parts based on the length `L`. The function handles the cases where `L` is 0 (returning all elements in the second part) and where `L` equals the length of `lst` (returning an empty second part). The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected in these scenarios and correctly describes that negative values for `L` are constrained by the function parameters. Since all specified potential cases seem to be handled correctly by the code, the correctness is confirmed.
