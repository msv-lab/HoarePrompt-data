Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(lst, L)` accurately implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and returns a tuple containing two parts: 

1. The first part contains the first `L` elements of the list.
2. The second part contains the remaining elements of the list starting from index `L`.

The output hints confirm the expected behavior:
- If `L` is equal to 0, the first part will be an empty list, and the second part will contain all elements of `lst`.
- If `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first part will contain all elements, and the second part will be empty.

The assertions in the code test various scenarios, including:
- A case with an integer list and `L=3`, which returns `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`.
- A case with a character list and `L=2`, which returns `(['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'])`.
- A case with another character list and `L=4`, resulting in `(['p', 'y', 't', 'h'], ['o', 'n'])`.

All these assertions are correct based on the expected outputs, and the function handles edge cases properly. Therefore, the implementation complies fully with the problem requirements, leading to the conclusion that the function is correct.
