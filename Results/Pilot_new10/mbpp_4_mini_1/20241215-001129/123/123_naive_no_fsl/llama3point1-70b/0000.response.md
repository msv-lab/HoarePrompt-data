To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to evaluate whether it adheres to the problem description. The function is expected to split a list `lst` into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`, and it should return these two parts as a tuple.

### Let's analyze the behavior of the program:

1. When `L` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`:
   - The function will return the first `L` elements of the list as the first part, and the remaining elements as the second part. This behavior is correct as it fulfills the requirement of splitting the list.

2. When `L` is greater than the length of `lst`:
   - The code still uses slicing `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`.
   - `lst[:L]` will return the entire list since `L` exceeds the length of `lst`, and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list.
   - In this case, it still produces a tuple, but it does not maintain the length of the first part being exactly `L` since that part is equal to `len(lst)`.

3. Edge case when `L` is negative:
   - In Python, if `L` is negative, slicing `lst[:L]` will return an empty list, and `lst[L:]` will still behave unpredictably depending on the length of `lst`. It does not conform correctly to the initial requirements as the length of the first part cannot be negative.

Given these scenarios, the function does not handle the case when `L` is greater than the length of the list appropriately, nor does it handle negative values for `L`. Thus, we have identified potential cases where the code does not behave as described.

Correctness: **False** 

Example of failure: 
- Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` would give `([1, 2, 3], [])` instead of returning a valid tuple that adheres to the rule of splitting with the first part being exactly `L`.
- Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], -1)` would give `([], [1, 2, 3])`, which does not meet the expected behavior as the first part should not be negative.
