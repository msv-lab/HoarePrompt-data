You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)

def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we analyze the function `func_1` which is supposed to subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.

1. **Understanding the Functionality**: 
   - The function uses the `zip` function to pair elements of the two input tuples. 
   - It then subtracts the second element from the first for each pair and returns the result as a new tuple.

2. **Analyzing the Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases demonstrate the intended functionality:
     - For `assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18))`, the calculation yields `(10-2, 4-5, 5-18)`, resulting in `(8, -1, -13)`.
     - For `assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16))`, it results in `(-13, -43, -13)` correctly.
     - For `assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12))`, we get `(-3, 7, -3)` correctly as well.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - Tuples of different lengths: The function does not have logic to handle cases where `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths. If `tup1` is longer than `tup2` or vice versa, `zip` will only pair elements up to the length of the shorter tuple. This could lead to unexpected results if not handled.
   - Empty tuples: If both tuples are empty, the function will correctly return an empty tuple. However, if one tuple is empty and the other is not, the function will return an empty tuple despite potentially unexpected user input.

4. **Conclusion**: 
Given that the function does not handle cases where the tuples have different lengths (it simply ignores the excess elements in the longer tuple), it will not behave as the problem description might imply in situations involving mismatched tuple sizes.

As we consider all potential cases, we find inadequate handling of tuples of different lengths is a significant oversight. Thus, the function does not correctly handle those scenarios according to the problem's description.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, of the same length containing numeric elements, and returns a tuple that consists of the element-wise subtraction of corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will encounter a `ValueError` during the execution of the `zip` function but this case is not handled within the function. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
