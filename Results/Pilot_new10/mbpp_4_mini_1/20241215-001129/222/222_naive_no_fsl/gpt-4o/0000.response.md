Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` aims to remove all lowercase substrings from the given input string. It achieves this by iterating through each character of the string and including only those characters that are uppercase (using the `char.isupper()` method). 

The provided assertions validate this logic:

- For the input `'PYTHon'`, the expected output is `'PYTH'`, which is what the function returns, as it filters out the lowercase 'o' and 'n'.
- For the input `'FInD'`, the expected output is `'FID'`, and again the function correctly filters out the lowercase 'n'.
- For the input `'STRinG'`, the expected output is `'STRG'`, and the function removes the lowercase 'i' and 'n' successfully.

Additionally, the function works correctly for other potential inputs given the design. For example:

- The input `''` (an empty string) would return `''` as there are no characters to consider, which is correct.
- An input like `'abc'` would return `''` since there are no uppercase letters, which is also correct.
- The input `'ABCDE'` would return the same `'ABCDE'`, which is expected.

Hence, since the function appropriately handles the specified cases and there are no edge cases that it fails to account for, the function is deemed correct.
