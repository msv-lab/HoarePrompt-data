Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not fulfill the problem description, which asks for the removal of lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the provided function only extracts uppercase characters from the string, ignoring any lowercase letters altogether. This divergence from the problem specification indicates that the function does not behave as required in every potential case.

For example, given the input string `HelloWorld`, the expected behavior (removing lowercase substrings) could lead to a return value of `HW`, while the function would only return `HW` by sheer coincidence in this specific case due to its incorrect logic. In cases like `abc`, the function would return an empty string as well, instead of appropriately indicating the removal of lowercase letters, which is not the intended functionality according to the description. 

Thus, since the output does not reflect the requirement to remove lowercase substrings, the function is not correct.
