Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem states that the function must remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided function `func_1` only extracts and returns uppercase characters from the input string and ignores lowercase characters entirely. 

For example, if the input string is `"HelloWorld"`, the output would be `"HW"`, which does not align with the requirement to remove lowercase substrings. Furthermore, if the input string is `"abcDefg"`, the expected behavior would be to return `"D"`, but that contradicts the description of entirely removing lowercase substrings.

Thus, the function does not accomplish the intended task of removing lowercase substrings, demonstrating that it is incorrect.
