Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided implementation only retains uppercase characters. 

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the expected output, after removing lowercase characters, should be "HW". However, if the input string is "aBcDeF", the expected output should be "" (an empty string), but the function will return "BDF" instead. 

This demonstrates that the implementation does not correctly handle the requirement to fully remove lowercase substrings, resulting in an incorrect output. Therefore, the function fails to meet the problem requirements.
