Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly identifies whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. It uses the modulo operator to check if `n` is not divisible by 2, which is the correct way to determine if a number is odd. All integers, both positive and negative, as well as zero, will return the expected result with this implementation:

- For any odd integer (e.g., `1`, `3`, `-5`), the function will return `True`.
- For any even integer (e.g., `0`, `2`, `-4`), the function will return `False`.

There are no potential edge cases or inputs that the code does not handle correctly according to the problem description.
