Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that checks if the parity of a given number `n` is odd. It does this by returning `True` if `n % 2 != 0`, which is the correct logic for determining if a number is odd. 

The assertions in the program verify the following cases:
- `func_1(12) == False`: 12 is even, so this is correct.
- `func_1(7) == True`: 7 is odd, so this is correct.
- `func_1(10) == False`: 10 is even, so this is correct.

Since all test cases provided return the expected outcomes based on the definition of odd parity, and there are no edge cases or missing logic identified, the implementation adheres to the problem description correctly. Thus, I cannot find a case where the implementation does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
