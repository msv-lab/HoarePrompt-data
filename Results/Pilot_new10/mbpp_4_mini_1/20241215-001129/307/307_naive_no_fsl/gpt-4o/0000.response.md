Correctness: **False**

The program is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. However, the assertion tests provided (i.e., `func_1(2)`, `func_1(3)`, and `func_1(4)`) indicate specific expected outputs for `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`.

The correct outputs are:
- For `n = 2`, the first triangular number with 2 digits is 10 (the triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...), thus the correct index that should be returned is 4 (since \( T_4 = 10 \)).
- For `n = 3`, the first triangular number with 3 digits is 105 (where \( T_{14} = 105 \)), thus the correct index that should be returned is 14.
- For `n = 4`, the first triangular number with 4 digits is 136 (where \( T_{16} = 136 \)), thus the correct index that should be returned is 16.

However, the program is incorrectly set up because it doesn't actually check or return correct values based on the given `n`. 

If tested for `n = 2`, `func_1(2)` correctly returns 4, which is expected; however, for `n = 3`, it outputs 14 correctly too, but when checking for `n = 4`, it will output 16 instead of 45, which is what the assertion claims to expect.

Thus the first discrepancy:
- When `n = 4`, the program does not give the right triangular number index for a 4-digit number. 

Overall it fails to establish the expected behavior for the input given the real triangular numbers, leading to the conclusion that the code is incorrect and cannot satisfy the problem description for every potential case.
