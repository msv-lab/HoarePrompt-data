Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. It works by calculating triangular numbers in a loop until it finds the first one that has exactly `n` digits. The assertions at the beginning confirm that it produces the expected results for `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`. 

To support this conclusion, let's briefly analyze the logic:
- A triangular number is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- The program checks the number of digits in the triangular number using `len(str(triangular_number))`.
- The loop continues to increment `k` until it finds a triangular number with the specified number of digits.

Since the logic handles the computation and verification of the number of digits correctly, and it appears to pass the provided assertions, it meets the requirements of the problem description for typical cases. 

No edge cases were evident that would cause the program to fail, suggesting that it properly implements the intended functionality.
