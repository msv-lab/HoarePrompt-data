According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely. Therefore, thereâ€™s no need for any adjustments to the program state to allow for the next iteration, as it can always execute again regardless of the current values of `n`, `k`, and `triangular_number`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**.
