According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will execute indefinitely as long as the program allows it to continue running. Therefore, there are no conditions that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time. The current state is sufficient for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number; `k` is 1**
