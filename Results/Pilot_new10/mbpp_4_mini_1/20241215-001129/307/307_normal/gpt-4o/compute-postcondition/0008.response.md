The variable `triangular_number` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 2, the calculation proceeds as follows:

- `triangular_number = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2`
- `triangular_number = 2 * 3 // 2`
- `triangular_number = 6 // 2`
- `triangular_number = 3`

After this computation, the value of `triangular_number` changes from 1 to 3. The conditions of `n` (being a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number) and the string representation length condition (which was not equal to `n` before the calculation) still apply, but since the `triangular_number` has changed, the check against `n` may or may not still hold true, depending on the specific value of `n`.

The output state reflects the updated value of `triangular_number` while mentioning that it is still required to satisfy the previous conditions of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number; `k` is 2; `triangular_number` is 3; the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
