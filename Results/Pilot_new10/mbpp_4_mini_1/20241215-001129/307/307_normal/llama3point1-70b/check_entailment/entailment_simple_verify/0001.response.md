Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. The annotated code confirms that:

1. `n` is correctly assumed to be a positive integer, which the program effectively uses.
2. The triangular number is calculated using the correct formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
3. The program checks the length of the string representation of the triangular number to determine if it has at least `n` digits.
4. It continues to loop by incrementing `idx` until it finds a suitable triangular number, and then it returns the correct index.

Thus, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** stands confirmed.
