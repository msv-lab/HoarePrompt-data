Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement. The problem requires finding the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

Here's how the program works:

1. It initializes `idx` to 1, which represents the index of the triangular number currently being calculated.
2. The function enters an infinite loop where it calculates the triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. This is the correct formula for calculating the `idx`-th triangular number.
3. It then checks if the length of the string representation of this triangular number is at least `n`. If it is, the function returns `idx`, which means that this is the index of the smallest triangular number that has `n` or more digits.
4. If the triangular number does not have `n` digits, it increments `idx` and continues the loop.

The function will always find the smallest index because it systematically checks each triangular number in ascending order. It guarantees that once it finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits, it will return the corresponding index `idx`.

Thus, the program correctly fulfills the problem description, ensuring that it always finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.
