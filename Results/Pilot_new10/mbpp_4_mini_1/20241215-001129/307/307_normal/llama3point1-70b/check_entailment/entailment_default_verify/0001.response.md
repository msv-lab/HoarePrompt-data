The original assessment indicates that the program is correct. Upon reviewing the program and the output hints, the following points can be made:

1. The program correctly calculates triangular numbers using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
2. It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`.
3. It increments `idx` until it finds a triangular number meeting the digit requirement.
4. The output hints explicitly state that it does not return 1 or 2 and only returns an `idx` once the condition is satisfied.

Based on the output hints, it is clear that the function correctly adheres to the requirements of the problem description, which states that it must find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. There are no contradictions or indications of edge cases that will cause the function to fail.

Since the program performs correctly according to the specified requirements and the output hints support this functionality, I believe the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
