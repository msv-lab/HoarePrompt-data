To calculate `triangular_num`, we apply the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given the initial values where `idx` is 2, we can compute:

1. `idx + 1` equals `2 + 1`, which is `3`.
2. Multiplying `idx` by `(idx + 1)`, we have `2 * 3`, which equals `6`.
3. Dividing `6` by `2` gives us `3`.

So, `triangular_num` is updated from `1` to `3`.

The variables that remain unchanged are `n` (still a positive integer) and `idx` (still `2`).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits; `idx` is 2; `triangular_num` is 3.**
