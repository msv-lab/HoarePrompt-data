The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits. 

- In Case_1, if the triangular number's string representation has a length greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns the index `idx` which is 1.
- In Case_2, if Case_1 is not fulfilled, the function returns the value of `idx` which is 2.
- In Case_3, if neither Case_1 nor Case_2 is fulfilled, the function returns a new value for `idx`, which is the previous value incremented by 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and determine the value of `idx` based on the conditions involving the length of the triangular number's string representation, returning either 1, 2, or an incremented value based on the checks performed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `1` if the triangular number's string representation has at least `n` digits; `2` if it does not; or an incremented value if both previous cases are not fulfilled.**
