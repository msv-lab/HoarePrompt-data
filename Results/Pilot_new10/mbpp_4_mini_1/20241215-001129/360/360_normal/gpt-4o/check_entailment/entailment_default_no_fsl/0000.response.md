Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return the sublist with the highest sum from a list of lists. The logic iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and compares it to the maximum found so far. If a new maximum is encountered, it updates both the maximum sum and the corresponding sublist.

The provided tests confirm the function's correctness in various scenarios. Importantly, the output hints state that if the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list, which aligns with the description of initializing `max_list` as empty.

Given these considerations, the function operates correctly for all potential inputs based on the problem description.
