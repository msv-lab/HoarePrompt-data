Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines the function `func_1`, which takes a list of lists containing numerical values and returns the sublist with the highest sum of its elements. Hereâ€™s an explanation of why it meets the criteria outlined in the problem description:

1. **Iterates over each sublist**: The function uses a loop to go through each sublist in the given `list_of_lists`.
2. **Calculates the sum of each sublist**: The function calculates the sum of the elements in the current sublist using the `sum()` function.
3. **Tracks the maximum sum and corresponding sublist**: It keeps track of the maximum sum found so far (`max_sum`) and updates both the maximum sum and the corresponding sublist (`max_list`) whenever a new maximum sum is encountered.
4. **Returns the correct sublist**: After all sublists have been evaluated, the function returns the sublist with the highest sum, as required by the problem description.

Additionally:

- If the input is an empty list, the function correctly returns an empty list, since `max_list` was initialized as an empty list and would not get updated.
- The assertions provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for various inputs. Each assertion checks that the output matches what is anticipated, confirming the correctness for the given test cases.

Overall, the structure and logic of the function align perfectly with the requirements established in the problem description. Thus, the implementation is proven to be correct.
