The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle situations where there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, highlighting that it will return the last occurrence found instead of any of them. 

Upon reviewing the annotated code and understanding the states of the program, it is clear that the function correctly identifies the sublist with the maximum sum. However, the function's current logic does not address the ambiguity that arises when multiple sublists have the same sum. The program indeed returns the last sublist with the highest sum without any distinction or handling of ties, which matches the original assessment.

Hence, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
