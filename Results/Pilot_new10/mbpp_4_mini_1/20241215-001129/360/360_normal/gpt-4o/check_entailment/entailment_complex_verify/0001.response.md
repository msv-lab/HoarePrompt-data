Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return the sublist with the highest sum. The program's logic for determining the maximum sum and updating the corresponding sublist is sound, as confirmed by the annotations and assertions provided. The state annotations clarify that the function handles both typical and edge cases correctly, such as when there is only one sublist or when the input is empty (in which case it returns an empty list). Hence, the function meets the criteria laid out in the problem description effectively.
