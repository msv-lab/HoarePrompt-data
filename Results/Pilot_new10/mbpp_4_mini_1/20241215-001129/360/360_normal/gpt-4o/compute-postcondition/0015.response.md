The value of `max_sum` is updated to be equal to `current_sum`. The state of `current_sum` is defined as equal to `sum(sublist)`, but the exact value of `current_sum` is not given. Consequently, `max_sum` will now equal whatever the current sum of the sublist is. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least `n` sublists where `n > k+1`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`**.
