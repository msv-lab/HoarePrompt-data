Postcondition: ***`max_sum` is the maximum sum seen so far, which is updated to `current_sum`, and `max_list` is equal to `sublist` if `current_sum` is greater than the previous `max_sum`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` remains unchanged, and `max_list` remains an empty list.***
