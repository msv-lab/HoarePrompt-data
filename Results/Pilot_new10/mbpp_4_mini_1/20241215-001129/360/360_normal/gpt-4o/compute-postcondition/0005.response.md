The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum`. Since `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, this assignment updates `max_sum` to be equal to `current_sum`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist` and is greater than the previous `max_sum`.**
