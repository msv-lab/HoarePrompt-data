Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list `lists` is empty. According to the problem description, the function must return the inner list whose sum of elements is the highest. However, if `lists` is empty, invoking `max()` on an empty sequence will raise a `ValueError`, leading to undefined behavior. Since the function does not account for this scenario, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
