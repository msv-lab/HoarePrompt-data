Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately identifies that the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of the problem description, which is to return the list within the list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The function utilizes Python's built-in `max` function with the `key` parameter set to `sum`, effectively identifying the inner list with the largest sum.

The annotations confirm that `lists` is a valid input structured as a list of lists containing integers. The behavior of the function has been analyzed under various conditions, including handling empty lists and lists containing negative integers, which the original assessment correctly addressed. Since all expected scenarios are accounted for and the function aligns with the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.
