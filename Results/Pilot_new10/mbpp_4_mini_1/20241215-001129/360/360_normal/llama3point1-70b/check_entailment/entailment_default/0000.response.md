Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function is designed to return the inner list with the maximum sum from a list of lists of integers. While it works correctly for typical cases where the input list is not empty, the output hints indicate a crucial edge case: if the input list is empty, the `max` function will raise a `ValueError` since there are no values to compare. This lack of handling for an empty list leads to undefined behavior and demonstrates that the implementation does not fulfill the requirement specified in the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
