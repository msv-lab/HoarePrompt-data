Final: **False**

Reason: While the function correctly identifies and returns the inner list with the maximum sum of integers from a non-empty list of lists, the annotated version of the code indicates that the behavior is undefined if the input list is empty. Since the assessment initially deemed the program correct without addressing this important edge case, I believe the original assessment is not accurate. The program does not handle the situation where an empty input list is provided, leading to potential runtime errors, which affects its overall correctness.
