You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist (i.e., one of the inner lists) with the highest sum of its elements. The use of `max(lists, key=sum)` is appropriate here, as it effectively finds the inner list with the maximum sum by utilizing Python's built-in `sum` function as the key for the `max` function.

In considering potential cases, the program will behave correctly under the following conditions:

1. If all inner lists are empty, it will return the first empty list, which has the sum of zero.
2. If there are lists with varying sums, it will correctly identify and return the list with the highest sum.
3. If there are multiple lists with the same maximum sum, it will return the first one encountered, which is also consistent with the behavior of the `max` function.
4. The program handles negative numbers appropriately, as the sum of negative numbers will also be considered.

Since I cannot find any edge cases or inputs where the function fails to conform to the problem description, the code is correct in all tested scenarios. Thus, the correctness is confirmed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of lists of integers and returns the inner list that has the maximum sum of its integers. If the input list is empty, the behavior is undefined as there is no handling for that case in the code, which could lead to a potential error. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
