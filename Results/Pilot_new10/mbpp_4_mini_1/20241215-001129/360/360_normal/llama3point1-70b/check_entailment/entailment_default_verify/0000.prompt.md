You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the list of lists with the highest sum of elements. The use of `max(lists, key=sum)` effectively finds the sublist with the largest sum by calculating the sum of each sublist and returning the one with the maximum value. 

To confirm its correctness, consider the following scenarios:

1. **Example with positive integers**: For `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]`, the function should return `[3, 4]` since it has the highest sum of 7.
  
2. **Example with mixed integers**: For `[[1, -1], [2, 3, 4], [0]]`, it should return `[2, 3, 4]` with a sum of 9.

3. **Edge case with empty lists**: For `[[], [], []]`, the function should return any empty list as they are all equal (sum of 0).

4. **Single list input**: For `[[1, 2, 3]]`, it should return `[1, 2, 3]` since it's the only option.

The program handles expected cases effectively and does not have any missing logic or edge cases that would cause it to fail based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of lists of integers and returns the inner list that has the maximum sum of its integers. If the input list is empty, the behavior is undefined as there is no handling for that case in the code, which could lead to a potential error. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
