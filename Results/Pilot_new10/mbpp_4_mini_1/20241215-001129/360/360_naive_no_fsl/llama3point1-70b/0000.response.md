Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist (i.e., one of the inner lists) with the highest sum of its elements. The use of `max(lists, key=sum)` is appropriate here, as it effectively finds the inner list with the maximum sum by utilizing Python's built-in `sum` function as the key for the `max` function.

In considering potential cases, the program will behave correctly under the following conditions:

1. If all inner lists are empty, it will return the first empty list, which has the sum of zero.
2. If there are lists with varying sums, it will correctly identify and return the list with the highest sum.
3. If there are multiple lists with the same maximum sum, it will return the first one encountered, which is also consistent with the behavior of the `max` function.
4. The program handles negative numbers appropriately, as the sum of negative numbers will also be considered.

Since I cannot find any edge cases or inputs where the function fails to conform to the problem description, the code is correct in all tested scenarios. Thus, the correctness is confirmed.
