Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to return the list among the input lists that has the highest sum of its elements. 

Here's why the function is correct:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity to ensure that any sum of a list will be larger during the first comparison.

2. **Loop Through Sub-lists**: It iterates over each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`. 

3. **Sum Calculation**: For each sublist, it calculates the current sum and compares it with the `max_sum`.

4. **Updating Maximum**: If the current sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and `max_list` to the current sublist.

5. **Return**: Finally, it returns the list (`max_list`) that had the highest sum.

The function passes all the provided assertions, and it handles the case where there is only one sublist. Additionally, it correctly finds the highest sum even if the input lists contain varying numbers of elements.

Since there are no identified edge cases or unexpected input scenarios where the function fails, the implementation meets the problem's requirements effectively.
