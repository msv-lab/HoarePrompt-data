Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(n)` takes a positive integer `n` and computes the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices from 0 to `n`. 

Hereâ€™s why the code is correct:

1. It iterates through all indices `i` from 0 to `n`.
2. It checks if the index `i` is even using `if i % 2 == 0`.
3. If it is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the cumulative `sum`.
4. Finally, it returns the total sum.

The use of `math.comb(n, i)` correctly generates the binomial coefficients. Since the loop and conditional logic handle all even indices properly, there are no missing edge cases or logic flaws. 

I cannot identify a case where the program would fail to produce the expected result for any positive integer `n`. Thus, the program meets the problem requirements for all potential inputs.
