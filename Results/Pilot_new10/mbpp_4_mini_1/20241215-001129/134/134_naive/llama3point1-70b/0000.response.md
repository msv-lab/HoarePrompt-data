Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the sum of the even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The logic involves iterating through all indices from `0` to `n` and checking if the index is even. If it is, the corresponding binomial coefficient is computed using `math.comb(n, i)` and added to the sum. 

In every case where `n` is a positive integer, the function will always correctly include only those binomial coefficients that correspond to even indices. Since binomial coefficients for `i > n` are defined to be zero, the program handles all cases correctly without missing any edge conditions. Hence, the logic is sound, and the function operates as required by the problem description.
