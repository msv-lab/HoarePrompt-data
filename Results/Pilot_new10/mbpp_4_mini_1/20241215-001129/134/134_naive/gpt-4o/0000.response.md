Correctness: **False**.

The problem description asks for a function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients. However, the given program simply returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which does not calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`.

For example, if we consider the binomial coefficients for `n = 4`:
- The coefficients are: C(4, 0) = 1, C(4, 1) = 4, C(4, 2) = 6, C(4, 3) = 4, C(4, 4) = 1.
- The coefficients at even indices are C(4, 0) and C(4, 2), which gives us: 1 + 6 = 7.

According to the problem description, the expected output for `func_1(4)` should be 7, but the program incorrectly states that `func_1(4)` returns 8. This discrepancy demonstrates that the program does not fulfill the requirements set in the problem description. 

Despite the assertions that check for some cases, the core logic is incorrect and does not compute the desired sum.
