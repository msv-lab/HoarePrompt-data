The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function computes and returns the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` ranging from 0 to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the sum of combinations for all even indices from 0 to `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns the sum of math.comb(n, i) for all even i from 0 to n.**
