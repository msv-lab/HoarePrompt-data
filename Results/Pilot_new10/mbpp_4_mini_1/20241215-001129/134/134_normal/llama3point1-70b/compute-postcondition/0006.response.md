`sum` is updated by adding the value of `math.comb(n, i)` to it. The function `math.comb(n, i)` calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken `i` at a time, which is a positive integer as `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 1. Hence, `math.comb(n, 1)` will return `n`. Therefore, the new value of `sum` will become `sum + n`. The previous value of `sum` is 1, so the new value will be `1 + n`. The other variables maintain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to `1 + n`, `i` is 1.**
