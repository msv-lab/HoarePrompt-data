According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the range `range(n + 1)` will always produce a sequence from 0 to `n`, inclusive. Therefore, the loop can execute, and it will iterate `n + 1` times.

At the end of the last iteration of the loop, the variable `i` will equal `n`, and `sum` will remain 0 unless modified by the loop body, which is omitted here.

For the loop to start executing, `i` must start at 0, which is handled by the `range(n + 1)`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0, `i` will start at 0**
