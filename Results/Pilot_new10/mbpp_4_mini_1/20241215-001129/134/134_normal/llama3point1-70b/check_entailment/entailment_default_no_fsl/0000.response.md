Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that computes the sum of binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even indices `i` from 0 to `n`. 

1. The loop iterates from 0 to `n` (inclusive), ensuring all relevant indices are considered.
2. The condition `if i % 2 == 0` correctly filters for even indices.
3. The function uses `math.comb(n, i)` which accurately computes the binomial coefficient representing the number of combinations of `n` items taken `i` at a time.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected by summing the values of the binomial coefficients at even indices. Thus, it successfully fulfills the problem requirements for all valid positive integer inputs.

Since the logic is consistent and covers all cases as expected, I conclude that the correctness of the code is valid.
