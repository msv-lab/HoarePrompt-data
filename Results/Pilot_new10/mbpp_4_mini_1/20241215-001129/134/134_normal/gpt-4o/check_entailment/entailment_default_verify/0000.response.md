Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` incorrectly returns `2 ** (n - 1)` instead of calculating the sum of coefficients at even indices from the binomial expansion. For example, for `n = 4`, the expected output based on the problem's requirements should be 7 (the sum of C(4, 0) and C(4, 2)), while the function erroneously returns 8. The output hints, while seemingly indicating that the program performs correctly, do not align with the goal of the function stated in the problem description, confirming the original assessment was indeed correct.
