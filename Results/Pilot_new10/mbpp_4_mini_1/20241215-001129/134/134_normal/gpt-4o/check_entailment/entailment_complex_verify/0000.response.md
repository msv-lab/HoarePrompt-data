Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients as required by the problem description. Instead, it performs a calculation of `2 ** (n - 1)`, which does not align with the intended functionality. Therefore, the assessment of correctness being **False** is justified, as the program fails to meet the specifications provided in the problem description. The annotations confirm that the functionality implemented in the code is not correct for the stated problem.
