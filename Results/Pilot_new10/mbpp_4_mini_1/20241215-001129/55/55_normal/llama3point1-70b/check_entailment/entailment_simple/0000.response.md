Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from snake case to camel case as specified in the problem description. 

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `snake_case_str`, which is guaranteed to be a valid snake case string consisting of lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores, and does not start or end with an underscore. This aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Splitting the String**: The string is split using the underscore `_` as a delimiter, resulting in a list of words. For example, the string `"this_is_snake_case"` would be split into `["this", "is", "snake", "case"]`.

3. **Capitalization**: Each word in the list is capitalized using the `capitalize()` method, which ensures that the first letter of each word becomes uppercase while the rest remain lowercase. After capitalization, the words from our previous example would become `["This", "Is", "Snake", "Case"]`.

4. **Concatenation**: The capitalized words are then joined together without any spaces (using `join()`), resulting in a proper camel case string, e.g., `"ThisIsSnakeCase"`.

5. **Output**: The function returns this final camel case string.

Thus, the function accurately follows the requirements set out in the problem description for converting a snake case string to a camel case string for all valid input cases.
