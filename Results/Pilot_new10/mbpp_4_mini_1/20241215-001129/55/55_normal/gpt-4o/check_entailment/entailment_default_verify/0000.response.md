The original assessment claims correctness to be **False** due to the function's inability to handle empty strings properly. However, the problem description and output hints clarify that the program is designed to convert valid snake case strings, which inherently implies that the input should not be empty (as it needs at least one underscore to function as intended). The assumption that valid input is provided indicates that edge cases like empty strings and invalid formatting should not be considered in the correctness evaluation.

Moreover, the output hints emphasize that the function is expected to capitalize each component derived from splitting the provided string, and it appropriately returns a string without any issues stemming from typical input assumptions.

Given this context, the original assessment appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the function's specifications concerning the expected input.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
