The provided function `func_1` is designed to convert snake_case strings to CamelCase strings by first splitting the input string `snake_str` at the underscores and then capitalizing each component. 

The output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where the input might lack underscores or potential leading or trailing underscores. However, the problem description asserts that there will be at least one underscore. 

Examining the code:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components))
```

The function splits the input string on underscores and capitalizes each component before joining them into a single string. This should work for valid inputs of the form specified in the problem description. 

However, let's consider some edge cases that were mentioned in the output hints:

1. **Leading Underscore**: If the input were to be `'_python_program'`, the output would incorrectly start with an empty string (i.e., `PythonProgram`), as it would attempt to capitalize an empty component before the first underscore.

2. **Trailing Underscore**: If the input were to be `'python_program_'`, it would lead to similar behavior; it would capitalize the last component after the final underscore but might create unexpected results depending on how the output is considered.

While the precondition states that there is at least one underscore, the potential issues with leading or trailing underscores still represent valid concerns that could lead the program to not behave correctly in all scenarios expected.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not handle cases where there could be leading or trailing underscores, which would create empty components that are capitalized. This leads to the conclusion that the implementation is not correct as it does not handle all potential corner cases appropriately, despite the assertion that the cases in the problem description work correctly.
