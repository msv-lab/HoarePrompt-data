The `components` variable is assigned the result of `snake_str.split('_')`, which splits the `snake_str` string into a list of substrings, using the underscore as the delimiter. Since `snake_str` consists of lowercase letters and underscores, and it contains at least one underscore, `components` will be a list of the resulting substrings. The exact content of `components` will depend on the specific value of `snake_str`, but it guarantees that the list will have at least two elements due to the presence of at least one underscore. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`snake_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, `components` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `snake_str` at the underscores**.
