Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `snake_str` consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, and returns a string formed by capitalizing each substring obtained from splitting `snake_str` at the underscores. It does not handle cases where the input may lack underscores (although the precondition states there will be at least one underscore), nor does it address potential leading or trailing underscores which would lead to empty components being capitalized and included in the output.**
