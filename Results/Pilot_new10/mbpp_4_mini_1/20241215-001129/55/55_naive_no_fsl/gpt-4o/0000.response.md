Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input string starts or ends with underscores or contains multiple consecutive underscores. For instance, if we supply the function with the input `'_python_program_'`, the expected output in camel case should be `'PythonProgram'`, but the current implementation would produce `'PythonProgram'` as well. However, if the input is `'python__program'` (with two consecutive underscores), the output should still be `'PythonProgram'`, but the program will result in the output `'PythonProgram'`.

Additionally, the code fails to convert non-lowercase letters (e.g., if the input is `'Python_Program'`, the output should be `'PythonProgram'`, but the current implementation will retain the input's capitalization).

Thus, the function does not cover all cases as described in the problem statement, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
