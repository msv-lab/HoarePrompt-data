Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the mathematical conversion of degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \frac{\text{degrees} \times \pi}{180} \). The provided annotated version confirms that the input `deg` is appropriately handled as a floating-point number representing an angle in degrees, and the output is the expected conversion to radians. There are no indications of errors or edge cases that would cause the implementation to fail given the assumption that valid input is always provided. Thus, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description.
