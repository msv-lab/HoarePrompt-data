The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `degrees`. `degrees` is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. After executing the function body, it returns the radian equivalent of the angle `degrees`, calculated by multiplying `degrees` by (math.pi / 180). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a numeric value `degrees` and return its equivalent in radians. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter degrees, returns the radian equivalent of the angle in degrees by multiplying degrees by (math.pi / 180).**
