Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a numeric value `degrees`, representing an angle in degrees, and calculates its radian equivalent by multiplying it by the factor of \( \frac{\pi}{180} \). This conversion formula is mathematically accurate for any degree measure, including both positive and negative angles, as well as non-integer values.

The assertions following the function define specific test cases, confirming that the function outputs the expected radian values for common angles (90, 60, and 120 degrees). Each assertion verifies that the function performs the conversion correctly for these sample inputs.

Since the code adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description for any numeric input, it is indeed correct. Therefore, the function always performs as expected, meeting the criteria set by the problem description.
