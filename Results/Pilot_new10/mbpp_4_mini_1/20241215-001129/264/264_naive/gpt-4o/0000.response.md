Correctness: **False**.

The program has a critical flaw because the assertions for `func_1` are placed before the function is defined. Thus, they reference a function that has not yet been declared, leading to a `NameError`. If the provided tests are executed, they will fail since `func_1` is not recognized at that point in the code. This means the program cannot be considered correct as it cannot handle all potential cases, including the case when the function is called before its definition.
