Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle the months that contain 30 days as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it returns the wrong result for month 12. 

1. The function correctly identifies that April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11) have 30 days, returning `True` for these inputs.
2. However, for month 2 (February), the function returns `False`. February typically has 28 days (or 29 in a leap year), but the problem description asks only about months with 30 days.
3. The biggest issue is that for month 12 (December), the function returns `False`, which is incorrect since December actually has 31 days.

Thus, the program does not adhere to the problem requirements for every potential case. For example, it does not correctly assess months that should have been identified as having 30 days. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
