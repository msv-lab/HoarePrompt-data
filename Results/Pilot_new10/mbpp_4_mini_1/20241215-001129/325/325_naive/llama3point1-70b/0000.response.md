Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function correctly checks whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month that contains 30 days. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are accurately captured in the list `thirty_days_months`. Therefore, any input month number from 1 to 12 will correctly return `True` if it is in the list (indicating it has 30 days) and `False` otherwise. The function handles all edge cases of the month input correctly since it only accepts valid month numbers within the specified range.
