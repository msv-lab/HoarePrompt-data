Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer parameter `month` representing a month of the year (1 for January to 12 for December) and returns `True` if `month` is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November); otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `month` is outside the range of 1 to 12, as it assumes valid input.**
