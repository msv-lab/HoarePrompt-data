Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input `month` is outside the valid range of 1 to 12. For example:
- If `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` is called, the function will return `False`, but these values are invalid for representing months. The expected behavior for invalid inputs is not defined in the problem description, leading to potential incorrect behavior when the function is called with such values. 

Since the program fails to account for all potential cases regarding valid month inputs, it is considered incorrect.
