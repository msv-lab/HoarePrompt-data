Final: **True**. 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly identifies the months with 30 days as specified in the problem description. The months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) are correctly included in the `thirty_days_months` list. The output hints confirm that the function's behavior is as expected: it returns `True` for the appropriate months and `False` for those that do not have 30 days. Since the program correctly implements the requested functionality based on the provided problem description and handles all valid inputs in the specified range (1 to 12), the assessment of correctness stands validated.
