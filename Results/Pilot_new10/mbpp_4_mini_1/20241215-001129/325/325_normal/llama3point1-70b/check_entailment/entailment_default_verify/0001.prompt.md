You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

The function aims to check if a specified month (given as a number from 1 to 12) has 30 days. The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). 

The program defines these months within a list called `thirty_days_months`, and then it checks if the input `month` is contained within this list.

Here are the potential cases to consider:

1. Input `month = 4` → Return `True` (April has 30 days) → Correct
2. Input `month = 6` → Return `True` (June has 30 days) → Correct
3. Input `month = 9` → Return `True` (September has 30 days) → Correct
4. Input `month = 11` → Return `True` (November has 30 days) → Correct
5. Input `month = 1` → Return `False` (January has 31 days) → Correct
6. Input `month = 2` → Return `False` (February has 28 or 29 days) → Correct
7. Input `month = 3` → Return `False` (March has 31 days) → Correct
8. Input `month = 5` → Return `False` (May has 31 days) → Correct
9. Input `month = 7` → Return `False` (July has 31 days) → Correct
10. Input `month = 8` → Return `False` (August has 31 days) → Correct
11. Input `month = 10` → Return `False` (October has 31 days) → Correct
12. Input `month = 12` → Return `False` (December has 31 days) → Correct

All potential valid inputs between 1 and 12 are accounted for correctly in the function.

However, the program does not handle the case where the input is not within the range of 1 to 12. If `month` is outside this range (for example, `month = 0`, or `month = 13`), the function will still evaluate to `False`, which is incorrect as those inputs are invalid and the function should ideally handle such scenarios (either returning an error message or a specific message indicating the month is not valid).

Since the program fails to accurately address all potential inputs as described in the problem (specifically regarding inputs outside the range), it does not fully fulfill the requirements set forth.

Therefore, the correctness of the program should be determined as follows:

Correctness: **False** 

The code does not work correctly for out-of-range inputs, such as `0` or `13`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `month` representing a month of the year (expected to be between 1 and 12) and returns `True` if it corresponds to a month with 30 days (April, June, September, or November), or `False` if it corresponds to a month with either 31 or 28/29 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December, February). 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
