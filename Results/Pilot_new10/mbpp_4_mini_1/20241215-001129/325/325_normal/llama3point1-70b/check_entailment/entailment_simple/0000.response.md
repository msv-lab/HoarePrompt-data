Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. It only checks if the given month number (1 to 12) corresponds to a month that has 30 days (April, June, September, November). However, the problem description specifically requests to determine whether the month contains 30 days or not. 

The issue is that the function returns `True` for months that have 30 days and `False` for those that do not, but it does not convey that January, March, May, July, August, October, and December have 31 days, nor does it mention February, which has 28 or 29 days depending on the year. Thus, the function could mislead a user into thinking that a call to `func_1()` might give a comprehensive answer regarding the total number of days in any month: it only signals days for the months with 30 days.

To summarize, the program only indicates the presence of months with 30 days instead of explicitly checking whether the specified month has 30 days as per the problem requirements. The check for months with 31 days and February is absent. Therefore, it does not provide a complete answer to the problem description.
