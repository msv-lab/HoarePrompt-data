Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input month is outside the valid range (1 to 12). If a month number less than 1 or greater than 12 is passed to the function, the program will return `False` since these months are not included in the `thirty_days_months` list. However, according to the problem description, the function should be designed to only accept month numbers that are between 1 and 12, and it does not provide any error handling or indication for invalid inputs.

For example:
- If `func_1(0)` is called, it should ideally handle this as an invalid input and return a specific message or raise an exception, but it simply returns `False`.
- If `func_1(13)` is called, the same issue occurs.

Thus, the code fails to meet the problem constraints for all potential cases, leading to an incorrect implementation.
