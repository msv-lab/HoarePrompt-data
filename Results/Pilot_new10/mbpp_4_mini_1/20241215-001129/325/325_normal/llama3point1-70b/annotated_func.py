#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the integer 'month' is in the list of thirty_days_months [4, 6, 9, 11]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` representing a month of the year (expected to be between 1 and 12) and returns `True` if it corresponds to a month with 30 days (April, June, September, or November), or `False` if it corresponds to a month with either 31 or 28/29 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December, February).
