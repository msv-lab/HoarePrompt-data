The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `month`. `month` is an integer that must be between 1 and 12, inclusive. After executing the function body, it checks if `month` is in the list of thirty_days_months, which includes the months 4, 6, 9, and 11. The function returns a boolean indicating whether the integer `month` is one of these thirty-day months. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `month` and return `True` if `month` has 30 days (i.e., if it is 4, 6, 9, or 11), and `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter month, and returns `True` if month is 4, 6, 9, or 11 (months with 30 days). If month is not one of these, it returns `False`.**
