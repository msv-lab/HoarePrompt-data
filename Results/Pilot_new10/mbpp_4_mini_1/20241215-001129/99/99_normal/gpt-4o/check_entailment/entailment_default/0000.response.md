Explanation: The code correctly implements the requirement to remove characters from a string that have odd index values. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the characters of the input string `s`, only including those characters whose index is even (i.e., satisfying `i % 2 == 0`). The function handles various input cases, including those provided in the assertions, and returns the expected outputs. Furthermore, it correctly handles the case of an empty string, returning an empty string as specified.

Correctness: **True**.
