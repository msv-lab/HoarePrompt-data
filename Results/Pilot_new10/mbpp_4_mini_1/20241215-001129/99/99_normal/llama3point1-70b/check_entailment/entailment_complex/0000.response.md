Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(s)` correctly implements the requirements described in the problem description. The goal is to remove characters from the string that have odd index values, which means retaining only those characters that are at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.). 

Here's how it works step-by-step:

1. The function accepts a string `s`.
2. It uses a generator expression `s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)` to iterate over the indices of the string.
3. The `range(0, len(s), 2)` generates a sequence of even indices.
4. It constructs a new string by joining together the characters at these even indices using `''.join(...)`.
5. If the string `s` is empty, the function correctly returns an empty string, as there are no characters to process.

Thus, the implementation accurately fulfills the requirement of removing characters at odd indices and returning the appropriate result, which validates its correctness according to the problem description.
