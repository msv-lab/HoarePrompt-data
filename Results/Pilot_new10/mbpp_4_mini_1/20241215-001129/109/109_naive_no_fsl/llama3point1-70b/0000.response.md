To analyze the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to consider the requirements: the function must take in two lists and replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.

Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else:
        list1 = list2
    return list1
```

### Function Logic:
1. It checks if `list1` is not empty.
2. If `list1` is not empty, it replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2` using slice assignment.
3. If `list1` is empty, it tries to assign `list2` to `list1`. However, this assignment does not modify `list1` outside the function due to Python's behavior with variable assignment and immutability. Specifically, `list1` will remain empty after the function call, even though it attempts to assign `list2` to it.

### Edge Case Considerations:
- Calling the function with `list1` as an empty list: `func_1([], [1, 2, 3])` will not raise an error, but `list1` remains `[]` because the assignment does not affect the original list.
- Calling the function with `list1` as a list with a single element, e.g., `func_1([0], [1, 2, 3])`, would replace `0` with `[1, 2, 3]`, leading to `list1` becoming `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Conclusion:
The incorrect handling of the empty `list1` case where it does not actually replace `list1` with `list2` means that there are scenarios where the code does not behave as described. Specifically, when `list1` is empty, the expected behavior is not achieved.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
