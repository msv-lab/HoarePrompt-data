To determine the correctness of the provided `func_1`, I will analyze the function according to the problem description. The function is expected to take two lists and replace the last element of the first list with all the elements from the second list.

Here's the implementation provided:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return list1[:-1] + list2
```

### Review of `func_1`

1. **Function Definition**: The function accepts two lists: `list1` and `list2`.

2. **Implementation Logic**:
   - It slices `list1` to exclude the last element using `list1[:-1]`.
   - Then, it concatenates this sliced list with `list2` using the `+` operator.

### Analysis Against Problem Description

The problem description specifically states that the last element of `list1` should be **replaced** with the elements from `list2`. However, the implementation avoids modifying the last element but instead removes it entirely.

The function's logic leads to the following behavior:
- For the input `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]` and `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, the output is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`, which is technically correct but does not follow the requirement of "replacing" the last element.
- For input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `[5, 6, 7, 8]`, the output is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, which is also correct but again does not replace the last element.
- For input `['red', 'blue', 'green']` and `['yellow']`, the output is `['red', 'blue', 'yellow']`, which again illustrates the same issue.

### A Potential Case Where It Fails

Consider calling the function with an empty `list1`:

- `func_1([], [1, 2, 3])` would raise an `IndexError` because `list1[:-1]` would be `[]`, and attempting to access it would result in unexpected behavior. 

Even more simply, if `list1` contains only one element, such as `['only']`, the attempt to "replace" would remove that last element entirely.

### Conclusion

The function fails to adhere to the problem's requirement for replacing the last element of `list1` with the entire `list2`. Thus, it is considered incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
