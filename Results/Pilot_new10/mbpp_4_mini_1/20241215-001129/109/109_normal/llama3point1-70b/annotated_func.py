#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists, and list1 has at least one element.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1 :
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else :
        list1 = list2
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are both lists. If `list1` contains elements, the last element of `list1` is replaced by the contents of `list2`. If `list1` is empty (but since `list1` has at least one element, this scenario does not occur), then `list1` references `list2`, making them the same list.
    return list1
    #The program returns list1, which has its last element replaced by the contents of list2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`. It replaces the last element of `list1` with the entire contents of `list2`. If `list1` is empty (which won't occur according to the precondition stating that `list1` has at least one element), `list1` would instead reference `list2`. The function returns the modified `list1`.
