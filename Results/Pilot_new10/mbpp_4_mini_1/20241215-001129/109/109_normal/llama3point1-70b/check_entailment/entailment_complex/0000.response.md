Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not strictly meet the requirements of the problem description. The main issue lies in how it handles the case when `list1` is empty. While the problem states that `list1` must have at least one element, the code includes an else clause that is designed to handle the scenario where `list1` is empty, resulting in `list1` referencing `list2`. This is unnecessary and potentially problematic, as it suggests that the function could have a scenario where it links `list1` to `list2` instead of officially replacing the last element of `list1` with the contents of `list2`.

Moreover, the line `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element correctly if `list1` has one or more elements; however, it doesn't handle cases where `list2` is empty properly, as it would just remove the last element of `list1` instead of replacing it with any element from `list2`.

Since the function doesn't properly adhere to the problem description in terms of how it can set `list1` to reference `list2`, alongside not handling potential empty cases of `list2`, it does not maintain correctness per the requirements.
