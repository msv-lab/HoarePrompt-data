You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in two lists and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists, and list1 has at least one element.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1 :
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else :
        list1 = list2
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are both lists. If `list1` contains elements, the last element of `list1` is replaced by the contents of `list2`. If `list1` is empty (but since `list1` has at least one element, this scenario does not occur), then `list1` references `list2`, making them the same list.
    return list1
    #The program returns list1, which has its last element replaced by the contents of list2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`. It replaces the last element of `list1` with the entire contents of `list2`. If `list1` is empty (which won't occur according to the precondition stating that `list1` has at least one element), `list1` would instead reference `list2`. The function returns the modified `list1`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
