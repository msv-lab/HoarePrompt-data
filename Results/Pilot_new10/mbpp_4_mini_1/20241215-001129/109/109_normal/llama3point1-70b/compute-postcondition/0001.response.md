The code `list1[-1:] = list2` assigns `list2` to the last element slice of `list1`. This means that the last element of `list1` will be replaced with the contents of `list2`. If `list2` has one or more elements, it will effectively replace the last element of `list1`. If `list2` is empty, the last element of `list1` will be removed.

Given that `list1` is non-empty, the output state will depend on the content of `list2`. However, since `list2` is unspecified, we can still state that `list1` will have had its last element modified or removed.

Output State: **`list1` is a list with its last element replaced by the contents of `list2`, and `list2` is a list.**
