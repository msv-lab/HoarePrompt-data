Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The task specifically states that the last element of the first list should be replaced with the elements of the second list. However, the implementation merely concatenates all elements of `list1` except the last one with all elements of `list2`. 

For example, consider the input `func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])`. According to the problem description, the expected output should be `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, as the last element `3` of the first list should be replaced with `4` and `5` from the second list. The current implementation would return `[1, 2] + [4, 5]` which results in `[1, 2, 4, 5]`. 

Moreover, if `list1` contains only one element, the outcome would not correctly replace the last element because it effectively yields just the second list. 

Hence, the code fails to meet the requirements of the problem in such scenarios, confirming that the function is incorrect.
