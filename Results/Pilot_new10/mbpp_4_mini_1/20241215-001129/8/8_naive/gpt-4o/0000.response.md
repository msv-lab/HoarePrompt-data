Correctness: **False**.

The program's logic fails in the following scenario: 

If the input string is `'aaa'` and the character to remove is `'a'`, the expected output should be `''` (an empty string), as it should remove both the first and last occurrence of `'a'`. However, the program will return `'a'` because it will identify that the first and last indices are the same and will hit the condition `first_index == last_index`, thus returning the original string instead of removing the character. 

This means the program does not correctly handle cases where the first and last occurrences of the character are the same and there are multiple instances of that character in the string. Thus, it is incorrect.
