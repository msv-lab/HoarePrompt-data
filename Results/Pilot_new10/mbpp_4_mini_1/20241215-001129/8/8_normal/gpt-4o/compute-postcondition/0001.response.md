To execute the given code, we analyze its impact on the initial state. The operation `s.rfind(ch)` will find the last occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. The result of this operation will be assigned to `last_index`. 

1. If `ch` is found in `s`, `last_index` will be updated to the index of the last occurrence of `ch`.
2. If `ch` is not found, `last_index` will be set to -1.

Since no other variables are modified, the state of the other variables will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state should show the result of the execution and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found.**
