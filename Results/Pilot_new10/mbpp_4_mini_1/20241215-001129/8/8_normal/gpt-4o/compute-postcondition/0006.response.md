The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string. After executing the function body, if `ch` is not found in `s` or if it appears an equal number of times (meaning the first and last occurrences are the same), the function returns the string `s`. Otherwise, if both the first and last occurrences of `ch` exist, the function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character `ch`, and remove the first and last occurrences of `ch` from `s` if those occurrences exist and are different; otherwise, it returns the original string `s`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string s and a single character ch, returning s if ch is not found or if the first and last occurrences of ch are the same; otherwise, it returns s with the first and last occurrences of ch removed.**
