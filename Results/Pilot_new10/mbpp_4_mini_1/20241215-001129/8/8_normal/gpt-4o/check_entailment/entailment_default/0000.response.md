The provided program is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a string. Let's evaluate its correctness based on the problem description and the output hints.

**Program Evaluation:**

The program uses the following logic:
1. It finds the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`.
2. It finds the index of the last occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`.
3. If `ch` does not exist in `s` (i.e., `first_index` is -1) or if it appears only once (meaning `first_index` is equal to `last_index`), the string is returned unchanged.
4. If `ch` appears more than once, it constructs a new string by removing the characters at `first_index` and `last_index`.

**Output Hints:**
The output hints clarify that the function should return the string unchanged if `ch` is not found or appears only once. Otherwise, it should remove the first and last occurrences of `ch`.

**Testing Edge Cases:**
- **Test with multiple occurrences:** `func_1('banana', 'a')` should yield `'bn'`, removing the first and last 'a'.
- **Test with no occurrences:** `func_1('hello', 'x')` should yield `'hello'`, unchanged.
- **Test with single occurrence:** `func_1('apple', 'a')` should yield `'pple'`, only the single 'a' is removed.

**Potential Issue Found:**
However, there is a failure when the string consists of the specified character repeated multiple times. For instance:

- Call `func_1('aaaa', 'a')` would return `''`, since it identifies the first and last 'a' but fails to correctly produce an output that remains intact in the characterization of removal of first and last occurrences under the scenario where the character `ch` fills the entirety of the string.

**Conclusion:**
There are edge cases where the program does not properly align with the problem description, specifically when the specified character appears multiple times consecutively. Given that it doesn't successfully handle all potential variations and cases as described, we conclude that the program has limitations. 

Correctness: **False**.
