The original assessment concluded that the function `func_1` is correct based on the various cases tested and the expected results. However, looking at the output hints provided, they explain the expected behavior of the function in a manner that raises a potential concern regarding the handling of cases. 

The function indeed returns the original string `s` when the character `ch` is not found in `s` or if it appears only once. According to the hints, if `ch` appears only once in the string, it should return the string unchanged, which contradicts the expectation that it should remove that single occurrence. Therefore, we can see a discrepancy between the expected behavior defined in the output hints and the original assessment of the program's correctness.

In conclusion, since the output hints imply that the function might not be performing as desired when `ch` appears only once (i.e., it suggests that the output might not remove this single occurrence), the function does not adhere strictly to the problem description. This indicates that there is an issue that the original assessment did not properly address.

Final: **False**
