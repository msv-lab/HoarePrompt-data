Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately describes the function's behavior based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character `ch` from the string `s`, and it behaves as expected when various edge cases are tested. The code appropriately returns the unmodified string when the specified character is not present or appears only once, and it correctly processes strings with multiple occurrences of the character. The annotations provided further clarify the expected states of the program at different points, confirming that the function reliably meets its requirements.

Overall, all analyzed cases have shown that the function performs correctly according to the problem description.
