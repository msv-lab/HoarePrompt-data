The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when there is only one occurrence of the specified character in the string adequately. However, the annotated version of the code clarifies that the function handles this scenario correctly. Specifically, the line `return s.replace(char, '', 1)` is executed when there is indeed only one occurrence of the character, leading to its removal from the string.

The functionality described in the annotated code clearly outlines that if `char` appears only once, it will be removed correctly, returning an empty string when applicable. Therefore, the logic does follow the requirements of the problem description regarding the handling of single occurrences.

The original assessment's claim that the program is incorrect does not align with the insights from the annotated version.

Final: **True**
