`last_occurrence` is assigned the value of `s.rfind(char)`, which finds the last occurrence of `char` in the string `s`. The value of `last_occurrence` will be the index of that occurrence or -1 if `char` is not found in `s`. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if not found; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if not found.**
