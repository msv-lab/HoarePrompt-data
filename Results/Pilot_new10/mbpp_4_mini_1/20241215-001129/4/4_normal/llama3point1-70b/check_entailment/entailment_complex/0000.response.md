Correctness: **True**

The program provided meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's break it down to understand why it is correct:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This means that out of all the bits that make up both numbers, only one bit should be different (i.e., one bit of 0 in one number should match with 1 in the other number and vice versa).

2. **Bitwise XOR Operation**: The program uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to compare the two numbers, `num1` and `num2`. The XOR operation returns a binary number where each bit represents whether the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different. If the bits are the same, the result is 0; if they differ, the result is 1.

3. **Counting '1' bits**: After calculating the XOR of `num1` and `num2`, the program converts the result to its binary representation using `bin()`, and counts the number of '1's in this representation with `count('1')`. 

4. **Condition Checking**: The function then checks whether the count of '1's is exactly 1 (`== 1`). If there is exactly one '1' in the binary representation of the result, that means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, which is the requirement stated in the problem description.

5. **Return Value**: The function correctly returns `True` if the condition is met (indicating the numbers differ at exactly one bit) and `False` otherwise.

Thus, the implementation directly corresponds with the requirements set forth in the problem description, confirming that it works accurately for all cases where two numbers differ by exactly one bit position.

In conclusion, the function behaves as expected, and the correctness is verified based on the logical flow of the code, ensuring all potential cases are handled as per the problem description.
