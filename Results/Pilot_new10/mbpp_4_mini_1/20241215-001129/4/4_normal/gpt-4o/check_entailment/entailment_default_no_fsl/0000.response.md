Correctness: **False**

The program checks if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by computing their bitwise XOR and verifying if the result is a power of 2. However, it fails to account for certain edge cases, particularly when dealing with negative integers. 

For example, if we consider the inputs `func_1(-1, 0)`, the XOR result would be 1, which is a power of 2. However, -1 and 0 differ at multiple bit positions, and thus the function should return False. This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle scenarios involving negative integers.

Therefore, since the function does not work as expected for all potential cases, the correctness is marked as False.
