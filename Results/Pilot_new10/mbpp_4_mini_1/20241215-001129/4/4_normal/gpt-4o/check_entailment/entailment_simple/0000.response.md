To verify the correctness of the program against the provided problem description, let's break down both the problem specification and the implementation in the annotated program.

## Problem Description:
The task is to create a function that checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only.

## Analyzed Function:
Looking at the function `func_1(a, b)`, it computes the XOR of `a` and `b`:

1. `xor_result = a ^ b`: This operation outputs a number that has bits set to `1` where `a` and `b` differ. 

2. `return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`: 
   - The condition `xor_result != 0` ensures that `a` and `b` are not the same. If they were the same, XOR would return `0`.
   - The second condition `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2. A number is a power of 2 if it has exactly one `1` bit in its binary representation. This means `a` and `b` differ by exactly one bit.

## Conclusion:
From the above explanation, the function correctly implements the logic to determine if the two numbers differ by exactly one bit. 

The test cases provided in the assertions confirm this:
- `func_1(13, 9)` returns `True` because 13 (1101) and 9 (1001) differ at one position.
- `func_1(15, 8)` returns `False` because they differ at more than one position.
- `func_1(2, 4)` returns `False` because they differ at more than one position.
- `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` because they differ at one position (2 is 10 in binary and 3 is 11).
- `func_1(5, 1)` returns `True` because they differ at one position.
- `func_1(1, 5)` returns `True` coming from the numerical identity.

As the program correctly identifies when two integers differ at exactly one bit position according to the problem description, the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
