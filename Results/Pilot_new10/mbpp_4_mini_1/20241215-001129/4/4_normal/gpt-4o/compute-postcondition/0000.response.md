The variable `xor_result` is assigned the value of `a` bitwise XOR `b`. The values of the integers `a` and `b` are not specified, but the result of the operation will be a new integer which represents the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers, `xor_result = a ^ b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `xor_result = a ^ b**
