Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to check whether two numbers differ at only one bit position. 

### Explanation:
- The function uses the XOR operation (`num1 ^ num2`) which results in a number where the bits are set to `1` only if the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` differ.
- By converting the result to a binary representation with `bin()`, and counting the number of `1`s using `.count('1')`, the program effectively checks if there is exactly one bit position that is different.
- The condition `== 1` verifies that there is exactly one such differing bit.

To validate this:
- For example, calling `func_1(2, 3)` performs the following:
  - `2` in binary is `10`
  - `3` in binary is `11`
  - `2 ^ 3` results in `01`, which contains one `1`, satisfying the condition.
  
- The logic correctly handles cases where the numbers are equal (e.g., `func_1(2, 2)` would return `False`), and handles edge cases such as negative numbers, zero, and examples like `func_1(0, 1)` where the bit difference is again at one position. 

No potential edge cases or examples have been identified where the function fails. Therefore, the program meets the described requirements for all potential cases.
