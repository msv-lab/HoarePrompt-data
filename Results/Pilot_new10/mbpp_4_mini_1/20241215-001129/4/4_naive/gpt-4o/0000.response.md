To determine the correctness of the provided program, we can analyze the problem description and the implementation in the given Python code.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to check whether two numbers differ at one bit position only.

### Implementation:
The implementation uses the XOR operation to compare the two numbers:
1. The XOR of two numbers results in a number that has bits set to `1` for every position where the two original numbers have different bits.
2. For two numbers to differ at exactly one bit position, the result of the XOR should have exactly one bit set to `1`.

The condition checked in the implementation is:
- `xor_result != 0` ensures that the two numbers are not the same.
- `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` is a common technique used to check if a number is a power of two (which implies it has exactly one bit set).

### Test Cases Provided:
```python
assert func_1(13, 9) == True   # 13 (1101) and 9 (1001) differ at one position
assert func_1(15, 8) == False  # 15 (1111) and 8 (1000) differ at multiple positions
assert func_1(2, 4) == False    # 2 (0010) and 4 (0100) differ at multiple positions
assert func_1(2, 3) == True     # 2 (0010) and 3 (0011) differ at one position
assert func_1(5, 1) == True     # 5 (0101) and 1 (0001) differ at one position
assert func_1(1, 5) == True     # Same as above, different order
```

### Verification of Logic:
Now, let's verify if the program handles any additional edge cases correctly.
1. Different bit lengths: The current implementation should handle different bit lengths correctly since the XOR operation will adjust for this automatically.
   - For example: `func_1(1, 2)` would return `True` (1 (01) and 2 (10) differ at one position).
  
2. Very large integers: Python handles integers of arbitrary size, so this should not be an issue.

3. Same numbers, e.g., `func_1(5, 5)` should return `False` but this condition is covered by `xor_result != 0`.

### Conclusion:
The logic for determining if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position is implemented correctly. All provided test cases pass correctly, and potential edge cases do not show any failure in the logic.

Correctness: **True**.
