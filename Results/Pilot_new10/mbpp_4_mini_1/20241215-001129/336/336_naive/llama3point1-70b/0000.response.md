Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` is designed to check if every odd index in the list contains odd numbers. The program iterates through each index of the list and checks whether the index is odd and the corresponding element in the list is even. If it finds an even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding such a case, it returns `True`.

This implementation correctly fulfills the problem's requirement for various potential inputs:
1. An empty list will correctly return `True` since there are no odd indices to check.
2. A list with only even indices will also return `True` because it does not violate any condition.
3. A list where all odd indices contain odd numbers will return `True`.
4. Any case where an odd index contains an even number will correctly return `False`.

Since it handles the specified conditions accurately for all potential edge cases and inputs, the correctness is confirmed to be **True**.
