To determine the conditions for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided information.

1. The loop iterates over the range of `len(lst)`, which means that the loop will only execute if `lst` has a length greater than 0.
2. The loop variable `i` will take on values from 0 to `len(lst) - 1` during each iteration.

For the loop to execute:
- `lst` must contain at least one integer (i.e., `len(lst)` must be greater than 0). 
- At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0, which is the first index of the list.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state involve ensuring that `lst` is not empty and initializing `i`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0**
