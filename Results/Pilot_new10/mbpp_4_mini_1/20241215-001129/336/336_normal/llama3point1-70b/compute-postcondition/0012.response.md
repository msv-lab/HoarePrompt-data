The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, if the specified conditions are met, the function can have multiple return points: it may return `False` in multiple cases, and it can also return `True` if the condition is satisfied. Specifically, if the function finds an odd index with an even integer, it will return `False`. If this condition is not met for any elements of `lst`, it will return `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return `True` if there is no even integer at any odd index; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers, and returns True if there is no even integer at any odd index in the list; otherwise, it returns False.**
