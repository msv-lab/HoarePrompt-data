Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether every odd index in the list contains odd numbers. The loop iterates through the list, and for each index, it checks if the index is odd (using `i % 2 != 0`) and whether the corresponding element at that index is even (using `lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are met, it returns `False`, indicating that an even number is present at an odd index. If it completes the loop without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

Additionally, the output hints state that the function will return `True` for an empty list, which is consistent with the program logic because there are no integers to evaluate, thus satisfying the condition. 

Overall, the logic of the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, ensuring that it addresses all potential cases correctly.
