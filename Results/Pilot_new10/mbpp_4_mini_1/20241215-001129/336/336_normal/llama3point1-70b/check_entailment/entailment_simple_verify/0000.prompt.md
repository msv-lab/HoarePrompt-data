You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` is designed to check if every odd index in the list contains odd numbers. The program iterates through each index of the list and checks whether the index is odd and the corresponding element in the list is even. If it finds an even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding such a case, it returns `True`.

This implementation correctly fulfills the problem's requirement for various potential inputs:
1. An empty list will correctly return `True` since there are no odd indices to check.
2. A list with only even indices will also return `True` because it does not violate any condition.
3. A list where all odd indices contain odd numbers will return `True`.
4. Any case where an odd index contains an even number will correctly return `False`.

Since it handles the specified conditions accurately for all potential edge cases and inputs, the correctness is confirmed to be **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(lst)`. If the loop does not return any value, there are no indices where `i` is odd and `lst[i]` is even, meaning the method does not find an odd index with an even integer. If `lst` is empty, `i` is 0 and the function does not execute, hence no return.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the condition was satisfied regardless of the contents of the list `lst` and that the method did not find an odd index with an even integer.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
