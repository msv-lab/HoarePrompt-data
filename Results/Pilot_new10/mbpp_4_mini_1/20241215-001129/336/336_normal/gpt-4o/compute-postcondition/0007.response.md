According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `lst` using an increment of 2, starting from index 1. This means the loop will include the indices 1, 3, 5, and so forth, up until the length of the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `i` is 3, which means the current index is 3.
- The integer at index 3 of `lst` is odd. 
- The length of `lst` is at least 4, allowing for the loop to run at least once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 2, resulting in `i` being 5 for the next iteration. We also need to ensure that the length of `lst` is sufficient to include index 5. Therefore, the list must have at least 6 integers.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 6 integers, `i` is 5, and the integer at index `i` of `lst` must be defined.**
