Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers and checks the integers located at odd indices. It returns False if any of these integers are even; if all odd-indexed integers are odd, or if the list is empty or contains only one integer, it returns True. The function does not handle cases where the list may contain non-integer types.**
