The original assessment provided is that the program is incorrect due to its handling of edge cases like an empty list or specific even-numbered lists. However, the annotated version clarifies that if the list is empty or has only one integer, the function correctly identifies these scenarios by returning `True`, since there are no odd indices that could contradict the rule.

Furthermore, the annotated code specifies that the state of the program ensures that if the for loop does not execute (meaning `lst` is empty or has only one element), it will correctly return `True`. 

The original assessment fails to recognize that the function's behavior for empty lists and lists with one item is acceptable based on the problem description, which does not specify behavior for such edge cases. 

Thus, considering the validity of the annotations and the explanation of the code's functionality:

Final: **True**
