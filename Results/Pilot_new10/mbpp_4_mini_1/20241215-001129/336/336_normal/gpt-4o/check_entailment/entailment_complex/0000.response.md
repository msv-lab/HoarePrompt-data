Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether every integer located at odd indices in the given list `lst` is an odd number. Hereâ€™s how it adheres to the problem statement:

1. **Iteration Over Odd Indices**: The loop `for i in range(1, len(lst), 2)` effectively iterates over all odd indices of the list. For a list of integers, these odd indices are (1, 3, 5, ...).

2. **Checking Conditions**: Inside the loop, the condition `if lst[i] % 2 == 0` is used to check if the number at the current odd index is even. If it is even, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all numbers at the odd indices are odd.

3. **Returning True**: If the loop completes without finding any even integers, it returns `True`, which means all integers at odd indices are indeed odd. Additionally, if the list is empty or contains only one integer, the loop will not execute, and it will directly return `True`, consistent with the requirement that odd indexed positions must contain odd numbers or, in this case, there are none to check.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: It correctly accounts for lists of variable lengths, including empty lists, and does not incorrectly identify the state of the list. The return values are appropriately handled based on the indices checked.

Thus, the function honors the problem description by ensuring all checks are made thoroughly for odd-index conditions, so it is deemed correct.
