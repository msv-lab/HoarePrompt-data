Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. Based on the problem description, the function returns True if either all odd-indexed integers are odd or if the list is empty or contains only one integer. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where the list may contain non-integer types.

For instance, if we test the function with a list containing a non-integer type, like `func_1([2, 1, 'a', 3])`, the program will result in a `TypeError` when it attempts to evaluate the modulus with a non-integer. Since the program fails to handle such cases and does not explicitly check for non-integer types, it is incorrect according to the problem description, which implies that all elements should be valid integers to make the assertions.

Additionally, the program logic itself does not return a False on lists with odd integer values that contain even numbers at odd indices. For example, with the input `[2, 4, 6, 3]`, it mistakenly returns True instead of False as expected.

Thus, because there are cases where the program does not behave as described, I conclude the correctness is False.
