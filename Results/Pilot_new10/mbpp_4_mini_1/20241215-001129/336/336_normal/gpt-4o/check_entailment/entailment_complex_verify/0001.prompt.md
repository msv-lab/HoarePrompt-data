You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program checks whether every element at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) in the list is an odd number. However, it fails to handle the case where the input list contains no elements, leading to the following situation:

Input case: `func_1([])`

For an empty list, the function will return `True` because there are no odd indices that can have even numbers (since there are no indices at all). However, based on the problem description, if there are no odd indexed elements in the list, the function's expected behavior is ambiguous and not clearly defined. 

Additionally, let's say we have a list with an even number of elements where the last odd index is valid but not odd itself:
Input case: `func_1([2, 4, 6, 8])`

For this input, the function would erroneously return `False`, ignoring the fact that there are no odd indexed elements actually present to contradict the rule because it does not validate the odd indices comprehensively.

Thus, the function does not account for all edge cases and can lead to incorrect outputs given certain inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, the integers at odd indices of `lst` are all odd if the loop completes without returning False; if the loop executes 0 times, `lst` must be an empty list or have only one integer.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all integers at odd indices of the list 'lst' are odd, or that 'lst' is empty or contains only one integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and checks the integers located at odd indices. It returns False if any of these integers are even; if all odd-indexed integers are odd, or if the list is empty or contains only one integer, it returns True. The function does not handle cases where the list may contain non-integer types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
