The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **False** based on its potential failure to handle an empty list and the ambiguity of expected behavior for such cases. However, upon reviewing the program and its annotated version, it is clear that the function is designed specifically to handle odd indices. The function checks that for any odd index `i`, if `lst[i]` is even, it returns `False`. If all odd indices meet the criteria or do not exist, the function will return `True`.

The mentioned edge case (`func_1([])`) returns `True`, which can be justified since there are no odd indexed elements that contradict the rule, fulfilling the condition logically. Moreover, the function does not fail or lead to errors in this case; it simply operates as the mathematical definition dictates.

Additionally, lists with an even number of elements, where the last odd index does not contain an odd number, do not impact the correctness since the function does not classify lists by their evenness or oddness but strictly handles the odd indexed elements alone.

Thus, the annotated version supports the claim that the program operates correctly under the stated assumptions, including valid input lists.

Final: **True**
