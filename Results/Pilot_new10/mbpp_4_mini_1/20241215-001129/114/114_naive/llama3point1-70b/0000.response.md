Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly uses the `count` method of tuples, which counts the occurrences of the specified element within the tuple. Since the method handles various cases properly, including when the tuple is empty or when the element is not present, it adheres to the problem description's requirements. All potential input cases, such as empty tuples or tuples with multiple occurrences of the element, are correctly accounted for.
