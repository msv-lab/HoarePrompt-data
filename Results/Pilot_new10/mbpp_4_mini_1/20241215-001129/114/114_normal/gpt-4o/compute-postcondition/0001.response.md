The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `element`. The parameter `tup` is a tuple that can contain elements of any data type, and `element` can also be of any data type. After executing the function body, it returns the count of occurrences of `element` in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to count how many times a specified `element` appears in the provided tuple `tup`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and returns the count of occurrences of `element` in the tuple `tup`.**
