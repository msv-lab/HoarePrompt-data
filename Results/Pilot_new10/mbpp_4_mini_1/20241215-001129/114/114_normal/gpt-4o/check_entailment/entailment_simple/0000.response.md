Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two arguments: a tuple (`tup`) and an element (`element`). It uses the `count()` method of the tuple to count the number of occurrences of the specified element in that tuple.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function accepts a tuple and an element as inputs, which aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: 
   - By using `tup.count(element)`, it efficiently counts the occurrences of `element` within the `tup`. This is exactly what the problem requires.

3. **Behavior on Various Inputs**: 
   - The annotated assertions provide test cases to ensure the function works across different scenarios:
     - When the element is not in the tuple (as in the case of `4`), the expected count is `0`, which the function returns appropriately.
     - When the element is `10` or `8`, the function returns `3` and `4`, respectively, which are correct counts based on the provided tuple.

Since the function handles the specified functionality accurately—counting occurrences of any element in a tuple—it fulfills the problem description as outlined.
