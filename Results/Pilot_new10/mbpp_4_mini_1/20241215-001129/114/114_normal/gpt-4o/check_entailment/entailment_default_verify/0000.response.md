The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is correct based on its ability to count occurrences of a specified element in a tuple, which it does by using the built-in `count()` method. 

While the function indeed performs correctly for the given examples, the output hints reveal that it does not handle scenarios where the input `tup` is not a tuple or where the `element` is not comparable to the items in `tup`. This is a limitation that could lead to unexpected behavior in cases outside the provided test cases.

Thus, the original assessment of correctness does not account for these potential issues, meaning it is not entirely accurate. Therefore, I must conclude that the program does not satisfy the problem requirements completely.

Final: **False**.
