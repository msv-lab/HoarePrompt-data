To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the function `func_1(real, imag)` and how it is supposed to compute the angle of a complex number.

The program uses the `cmath.phase()` function to get the angle (or phase) of a complex number. The angles returned by `cmath.phase()` are given in radians and correspond to the angle from the positive x-axis to the vector representing the complex number in the polar coordinate system.

Here's the analysis based on potential use cases:

1. **Basic Complex Numbers**: The provided assertions check some common complex numbers:
   - `(0, 1j)` which corresponds to the complex number `0 + 1j`. Its angle should be `π/2` radians (or approximately `1.5708`), which is correctly computed.
   - `(2, 1j)` corresponds to `2 + 1j`. Its angle is approximately `0.4636`, which is also correctly computed.
   - `(0, 2j)` corresponds to `0 + 2j`. Its angle should again be `π/2` radians, accurately computed.

2. **Additional Cases to Consider**:
   - **Negative imaginary part**: For example, `func_1(0, -1j)` should return `-π/2` or approximately `-1.5708`, which the program handles because `cmath.phase(0 - 1j)` correctly returns this value. 
   - **Positive real part, zero imaginary part**: For `func_1(3, 0)`, the angle should be `0` radians, and this is correctly handled as well since `cmath.phase(3 + 0j)` produces `0`.
   - **Negative real part**: For `func_1(-3, 0)`, this should return `π` (or `3.1415`), which `cmath.phase(-3 + 0j)` correctly computes.

3. **Zero Input**: The function should also handle the zero input case: `func_1(0, 0)`. The phase of a zero complex number is typically undefined or considered `0`, depending on the mathematical context. In this implementation, `cmath.phase(0)` returns `0`, which might be acceptable in many interpretations but could be argued as a potential edge case.

After considering these scenarios, the function consistently computes the angles as expected for all examined cases, including negative components and zero input.

Given this thorough evaluation and testing of various cases:

Correctness: **True**

The rationale is that the function correctly computes the angle for all tested complex numbers, including negative values and zero, adhering to the expected mathematical definitions for the phase of complex numbers.
