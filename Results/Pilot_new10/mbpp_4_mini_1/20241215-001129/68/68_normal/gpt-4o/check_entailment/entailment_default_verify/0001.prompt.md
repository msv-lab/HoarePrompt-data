You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the function `func_1(real, imag)` and how it is supposed to compute the angle of a complex number.

The program uses the `cmath.phase()` function to get the angle (or phase) of a complex number. The angles returned by `cmath.phase()` are given in radians and correspond to the angle from the positive x-axis to the vector representing the complex number in the polar coordinate system.

Here's the analysis based on potential use cases:

1. **Basic Complex Numbers**: The provided assertions check some common complex numbers:
   - `(0, 1j)` which corresponds to the complex number `0 + 1j`. Its angle should be `π/2` radians (or approximately `1.5708`), which is correctly computed.
   - `(2, 1j)` corresponds to `2 + 1j`. Its angle is approximately `0.4636`, which is also correctly computed.
   - `(0, 2j)` corresponds to `0 + 2j`. Its angle should again be `π/2` radians, accurately computed.

2. **Additional Cases to Consider**:
   - **Negative imaginary part**: For example, `func_1(0, -1j)` should return `-π/2` or approximately `-1.5708`, which the program handles because `cmath.phase(0 - 1j)` correctly returns this value. 
   - **Positive real part, zero imaginary part**: For `func_1(3, 0)`, the angle should be `0` radians, and this is correctly handled as well since `cmath.phase(3 + 0j)` produces `0`.
   - **Negative real part**: For `func_1(-3, 0)`, this should return `π` (or `3.1415`), which `cmath.phase(-3 + 0j)` correctly computes.

3. **Zero Input**: The function should also handle the zero input case: `func_1(0, 0)`. The phase of a zero complex number is typically undefined or considered `0`, depending on the mathematical context. In this implementation, `cmath.phase(0)` returns `0`, which might be acceptable in many interpretations but could be argued as a potential edge case.

After considering these scenarios, the function consistently computes the angles as expected for all examined cases, including negative components and zero input.

Given this thorough evaluation and testing of various cases:

Correctness: **True**

The rationale is that the function correctly computes the angle for all tested complex numbers, including negative values and zero, adhering to the expected mathematical definitions for the phase of complex numbers.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two numerical values, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these parts and returns its phase (argument), calculated using the `cmath.phase` function. This effectively gives the angle in radians of the complex number in the polar coordinate system. The function correctly handles cases where `real` is zero, and it avoids any division by zero errors since the phase is computed internally using the `cmath` library. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
