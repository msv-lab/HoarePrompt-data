Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly evaluates the function `func_1(real, imag)` based on the problem description, which asks for the angle of a complex number. The assessment confirms that function accurately computes the angle of complex numbers using `cmath.phase()`, and provides a range of testing scenarios that support the correctness of the implementation. The annotated code aligns with the original assessment, confirming the understanding of the real and imaginary inputs and their conversion to a complex number for phase calculation. Thus, the program meets the expectations set by the problem description.
