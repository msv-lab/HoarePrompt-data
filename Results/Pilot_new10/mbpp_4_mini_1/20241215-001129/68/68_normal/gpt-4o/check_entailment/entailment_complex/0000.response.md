Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality as defined in the problem description, which is to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(real, imag)` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.

2. **Complex Number Construction**: Inside the function, a complex number is constructed using Python's built-in `complex()` function, which correctly creates a complex number from the provided real and imaginary parts.

3. **Angle Calculation**: The angle (or phase) of the complex number is calculated using `cmath.phase(complex_number)`. The `cmath.phase` function returns the phase of the complex number in radians, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation correctly handles special cases such as when the real part is zero, which is important because the phase of complex numbers is defined even when `real` is zero (yielding angles of π/2 or -π/2 depending on the imaginary part).

5. **Assertions**: The program includes assertions that test the function with specific complex numbers and compares the results to the expected angles (in radians). These assertions confirm that the function produces correct outputs for at least some representative cases.

Overall, the program accomplishes the goal of computing the angle of a complex number from its real and imaginary components, adhering to the specifications laid out in the problem description.
