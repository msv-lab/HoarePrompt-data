The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are numerical values representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. After executing the function body, it returns the phase (angle) of the complex number created from the given `real` and `imag` values by using the `cmath.phase` function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept numerical values `real` and `imag`, and return the phase (angle) of the complex number formed from these values.

Functionality: **The function accepts numerical values real and imag, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number created from these values.**
