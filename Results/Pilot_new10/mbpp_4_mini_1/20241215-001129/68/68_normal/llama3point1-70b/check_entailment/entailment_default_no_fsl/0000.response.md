Correctness: **False**

The program does correctly compute the phase (angle) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. However, the hints mention that no edge cases or exceptions are handled, which implies that the program does not account for invalid inputs. 

For instance, if the function is called with non-numerical inputs (like strings or None), the code would raise a `TypeError`, which indicates it does not meet the problem's requirement for handling all potential cases. Therefore, since the program does not correctly function for every potential case of valid and invalid inputs, the correctness is deemed false.
