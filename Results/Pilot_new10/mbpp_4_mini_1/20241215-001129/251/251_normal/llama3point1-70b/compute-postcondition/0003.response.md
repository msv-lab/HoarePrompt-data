The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, it calculates and returns `r`, which is the hypotenuse calculated using the coordinates (x, y), and `phi`, which is the angle calculated using the coordinates (y, x). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two real numbers representing coordinates and return the hypotenuse and the angle based on those coordinates.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, which are real numbers, and returns the hypotenuse r and the angle phi calculated from the coordinates (x, y) and (y, x) respectively.**
