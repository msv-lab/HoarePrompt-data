The variable `r` is assigned the value of the hypotenuse calculated using the values of `x` and `y` as the rectangular coordinates. The function `math.hypot(x, y)` computes the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, which gives the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides `x` and `y`. The states of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates, `r` is equal to math.hypot(x, y)**.
