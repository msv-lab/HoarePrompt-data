Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(x, y)` correctly executes the conversion from rectangular to polar coordinates as described in the problem. The use of `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radius `r` is appropriate and aligns with the required mathematical definition of the distance from the origin to a point (x, y). The angle `phi` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which correctly accounts for the signs of both `x` and `y` to return the angle in the correct quadrant.

The annotated version reinforces this conclusion, confirming that `r` and `phi` are indeed the appropriate polar coordinates corresponding to the input rectangular coordinates. Thus, the function behaves as expected for its intended purpose.
