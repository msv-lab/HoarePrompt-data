The variable `theta` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which calculates the angle (in radians) corresponding to the point (`x`, `y`) in polar coordinates. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, as this computation does not affect them. Therefore, we keep the original state of `x` and `y`, while `theta` now represents the angle determined by their coordinates.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are floating-point numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `theta` is the angle in radians calculated from `math.atan2(y, x)`.**
