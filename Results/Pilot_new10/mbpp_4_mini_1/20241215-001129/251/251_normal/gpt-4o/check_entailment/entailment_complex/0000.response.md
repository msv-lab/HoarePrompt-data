Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ) as required by the problem description. 

Here’s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Radial Coordinate Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the radial coordinate `r` using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). This is the standard way to convert from rectangular to polar coordinates.

3. **Angular Coordinate Calculation**: The angle `θ` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`. This function handles all quadrants correctly, ensuring that the angle is computed accurately based on the signs of `x` and `y`, which is crucial for determining the correct direction in polar coordinates.

4. **Returned Values**: The function returns a tuple containing both `r` and `θ`, which aligns with the typical format for representing polar coordinates.

5. **Edge Cases**: The use of `math.atan2(y, x)` avoids potential division by zero issues and correctly handles cases when `x` is 0 (e.g., when points are on the y-axis).

The assertions included in the code further reinforce that the function behaves as expected for various input values, confirming the correctness of the implementation.

Overall, since the program adheres to the problem description and behaves correctly across all specified scenarios and potential edge cases, the verification concludes that the implementation is indeed correct.
