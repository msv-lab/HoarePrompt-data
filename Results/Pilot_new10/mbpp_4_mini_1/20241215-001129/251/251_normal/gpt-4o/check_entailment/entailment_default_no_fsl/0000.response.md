Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). The calculations for `r` and `theta` are done using the appropriate mathematical formulas:

1. **Radial Coordinate (r)**: The formula √(x² + y²) is correctly used to calculate the distance from the origin, which is the correct definition of the radial coordinate in polar coordinates.

2. **Angle (theta)**: The use of `math.atan2(y, x)` is appropriate as it calculates the angle in the correct quadrant and handles special cases like when `x` is zero. This function returns the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (x, y) and works for all quadrants, which means it avoids the common pitfalls of using `tan` and `arctan` alone.

Moreover, the provided assertions test various pairs of coordinates, including positives and negatives, confirming that the function handles a diverse range of inputs correctly.

Since all potential cases outlined in the hints align with the functionality provided in the code and the expected outputs are accurate, I conclude that the program is correct.
