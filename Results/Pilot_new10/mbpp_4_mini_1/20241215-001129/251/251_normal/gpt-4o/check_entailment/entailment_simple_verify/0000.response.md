Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates by utilizing the correct mathematical formulas. The annotations confirm that the function calculates the radial distance \( r \) and the angle \( \theta \) using the specified methods. Furthermore, the assertions provide valid tests that affirm the output of the function aligns with the expected transformations. Since the inputs are assumed valid, the function's correctness holds across all expected scenarios as outlined in the problem description.
