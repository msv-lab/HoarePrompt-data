Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas specified. The annotated code confirms that the calculations for the distance `r` and the angle `theta` are performed accurately, appropriately handling all scenarios as noted in the original assessment. The assertions further validate the function by testing it with specific inputs and expected outputs. Given the assumptions of valid input, the overall assessment of correctness aligns with the functionality defined in the problem description and thus remains accurate.
