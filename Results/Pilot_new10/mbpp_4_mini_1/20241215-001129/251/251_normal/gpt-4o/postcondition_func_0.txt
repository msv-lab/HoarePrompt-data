The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `x` and `y`, representing rectangular coordinates, and calculates the radial coordinate `r` as the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) using the formula √(x² + y²). It also calculates the angle `theta` in radians using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which correctly handles all quadrants and edge cases, such as when `x` is 0, avoiding division by zero errors. The function returns both `r` and `theta`.
