Functionality: ** The function accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, along with a positive integer `size` which represents the number of elements in each list. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list and computes the median. If `size` is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, it returns the middle element of the merged list. However, the function does not handle cases where the input lists might be empty or the assumption that `size` is equal to the length of the merged list may not hold true if the lists are not of the specified size. Additionally, there could be issues if `size` is not assigned correctly according to list lengths or if the lists contain negative integers.**
