The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect. However, upon reviewing the annotated version and considering the problem description, it is clear that the program's logic has significant flaws.

1. The `middle_index` is indeed calculated as `size - 1`, which is incorrect for finding the middle of the merged list, where one would expect to calculate the middle as `size // 2` to access the correct indices for both even and odd sizes.

2. In the case of an even-sized list, the program attempts to calculate the median using the last two indices (the terminus of the merged list) instead of properly leveraging the middle indices.

3. According to the annotations, if `size` is even, the median would be calculated incorrectly as (merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2, which is not valid because `merged_list[size]` is out of bounds and would raise an error.

Thus, considering these points from the annotations and the problem description, I maintain the original assessment's conclusion that this program has logical flaws pertaining to the calculation of median values. 

Final: **False**
