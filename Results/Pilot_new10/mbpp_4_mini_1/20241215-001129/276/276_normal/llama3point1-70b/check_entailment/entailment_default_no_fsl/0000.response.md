Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for several reasons:

1. The function assumes that both input lists (`list1` and `list2`) are always of the specified `size`. If the lists are empty or their lengths do not match `size`, the program will either fail or give incorrect results.

2. The median logic is flawed. The calculation for `middle_index` is not properly positioned for even-sized lists; it should be `size // 2 - 1` for the first middle element and `size // 2` for the second middle element. The program currently uses `size - 1` which is intended for odd-sized lists, leading to incorrect median calculations when the size is even.

3. The output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where input lists might be empty. This is a critical edge case that the program should account for.

Therefore, as the program does not handle various edge cases and potentially produces incorrect results, the correctness is deemed **False**.
