You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program attempts to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size, but it has a couple of issues:

1. The logic for determining the middle index is incorrect. The variable `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which would be the last index in a zero-based index list. It should instead be `size // 2` to find the correct middle index.

2. The function assumes that if `size` is even, it correctly computes the median using the two middle elements. However, the condition for finding the median should depend on the correct middle indices for even and odd sizes (which the function does not correctly implement).

3. Given that the function does not correctly handle the sizes, for the input examples where both lists have a size of 4, the function would incorrectly compute the median. For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, the function as written would incorrectly handle the calculation of indices and subsequently yield incorrect median results.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for certain inputs where the lists are sorted and of the same size.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, along with a positive integer `size` which represents the number of elements in each list. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list and computes the median. If `size` is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, it returns the middle element of the merged list. However, the function does not handle cases where the input lists might be empty or the assumption that `size` is equal to the length of the merged list may not hold true if the lists are not of the specified size. Additionally, there could be issues if `size` is not assigned correctly according to list lengths or if the lists contain negative integers. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
