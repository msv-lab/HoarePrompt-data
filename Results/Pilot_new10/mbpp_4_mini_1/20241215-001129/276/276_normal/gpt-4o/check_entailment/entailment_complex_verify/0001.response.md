Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1` correctly computes the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The annotated version confirms that the logic for merging the two lists, calculating the median for both even and odd lengths, and handling input as intended is implemented correctly. The function passes all provided test cases, aligns with the problem description, and appropriately utilizes the variable states at various points in the program execution. All assumptions regarding valid input are acknowledged, supporting the correctness of the function.
