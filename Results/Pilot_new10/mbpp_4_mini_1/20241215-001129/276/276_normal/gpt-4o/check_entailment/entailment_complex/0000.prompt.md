You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are two sorted lists of integers of the same size, and n is a positive integer equal to the length of either list1 or list2.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of integers of the same size; `n` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list combining `list1` and `list2`; `mid` is equal to `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, then `median` is equal to (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2. Otherwise, `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged list, which is calculated based on whether the length of `merged_list` is even or odd. If it is even, the program returns the average of the two middle elements; if it is odd, the program returns the middle element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and a positive integer `n`, which represents the length of either list. It merges `list1` and `list2` into a new sorted list and calculates the median of this merged list. If the merged list has an even length, the function correctly returns the average of the two middle elements; if the merged list has an odd length, it returns the middle element. The function assumes that both input lists are of the same size and does not handle cases where the lists might be empty or of different lengths.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
