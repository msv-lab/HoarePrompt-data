Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is intended to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, it does not strictly adhere to the problem description due to the following reasons:

1. **Input Validation Ignored**: The function does not perform any check to ensure that the input lists `list1` and `list2` are indeed of the same size, even though the problem states that they should be. If the lists are of different lengths, the results would be unpredictable.

2. **Potential for Merged List Issues**: While the function merges the two lists and calculates the median, if either input list is empty (which is an edge case not handled as per the assumptions in the annotations), the merged list will also be empty, causing an error when attempting to calculate the median.

3. **Odd and Even Length Handling**: The way the code calculates the median from the merged list is incorrect if `n` is considered. When `len(merged_list)` is odd, it returns `merged_list[mid]`, which is actually correct. However, when the length is even, it retrieves `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`, effectively using indexes that could be problematic if the assumption of the even handling is incorrectly indexed which is vague in the comments.

Overall, the function does not fully respect the problem constraints or validate the provided inputs adequately, and hence, it may not yield correct results in various scenarios specified in the problem description.
