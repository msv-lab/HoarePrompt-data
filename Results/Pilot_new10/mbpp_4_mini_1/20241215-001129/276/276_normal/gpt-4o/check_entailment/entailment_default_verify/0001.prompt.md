You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and computes the median based on whether the total length is even or odd. 

To verify correctness, we can consider the following:

1. **Merging and Sorting**: The given test cases demonstrate the function is correctly merging and sorting the provided lists:
   - For the first test case, merging [1, 12, 15, 26, 38] and [2, 13, 17, 30, 45] results in [1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45], which has a median of 16.0.
   - For the second test case, merging [2, 4, 8, 9] and [7, 13, 19, 28] results in [2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 19, 28], yielding a median of 8.5.
   - The third test case also confirms this behavior.

2. **Even and Odd Lengths**: The logic for calculating the median for both even-length and odd-length combined lists is implemented correctly:
   - It correctly identifies when there are an even number of elements (using the formula for calculating the average of the two middle elements).

3. **Functionality Check**: The function can handle various sizes of lists as indicated by the input examples.

Given that the program passes all specified cases and adheres to the problem description without missing logic or handling of edge cases, it qualifies as correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and a positive integer `n`, which represents the length of either list. It merges `list1` and `list2` into a new sorted list and calculates the median of this merged list. If the merged list has an even length, the function correctly returns the average of the two middle elements; if the merged list has an odd length, it returns the middle element. The function assumes that both input lists are of the same size and does not handle cases where the lists might be empty or of different lengths. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
