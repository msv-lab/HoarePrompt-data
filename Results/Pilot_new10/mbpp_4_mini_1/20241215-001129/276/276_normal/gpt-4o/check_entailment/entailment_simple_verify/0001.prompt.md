You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and computes the median based on whether the total length is even or odd. 

To verify correctness, we can consider the following:

1. **Merging and Sorting**: The given test cases demonstrate the function is correctly merging and sorting the provided lists:
   - For the first test case, merging [1, 12, 15, 26, 38] and [2, 13, 17, 30, 45] results in [1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45], which has a median of 16.0.
   - For the second test case, merging [2, 4, 8, 9] and [7, 13, 19, 28] results in [2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 19, 28], yielding a median of 8.5.
   - The third test case also confirms this behavior.

2. **Even and Odd Lengths**: The logic for calculating the median for both even-length and odd-length combined lists is implemented correctly:
   - It correctly identifies when there are an even number of elements (using the formula for calculating the average of the two middle elements).

3. **Functionality Check**: The function can handle various sizes of lists as indicated by the input examples.

Given that the program passes all specified cases and adheres to the problem description without missing logic or handling of edge cases, it qualifies as correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are two sorted lists of integers of the same size, and n is a positive integer equal to the length of either list1 or list2.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of integers of the same size; `n` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list combining `list1` and `list2`; `mid` is equal to `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, then `median` is equal to (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2. Otherwise, `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged list, which is calculated based on whether the length of `merged_list` is even or odd. If it is even, the program returns the average of the two middle elements; if it is odd, the program returns the middle element.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
