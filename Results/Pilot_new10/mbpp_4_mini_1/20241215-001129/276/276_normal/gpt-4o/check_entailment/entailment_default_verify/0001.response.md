Final: **False**

Reason: While the original assessment claims that the function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where the input lists might be empty or of different lengths. This is a critical oversight as it implies the function may not be robust in all scenarios. For example, if either of the lists were empty, the function would still proceed to calculate a median without proper validation, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior or errors. Therefore, the lack of handling for these edge cases renders the function not fully correct according to the problem's requirements.
