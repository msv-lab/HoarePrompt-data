The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the length of `merged_list` divided by 2. Since `merged_list` is defined as a sorted list combining `list1` and `list2`, its length is equal to `n + n` (because both `list1` and `list2` have the same size `n`). Therefore, `mid` will be equal to `(2 * n) // 2`, which simplifies to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of integers of the same size; `n` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list combining `list1` and `list2`; `mid` is equal to `n`.**
