Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and computes the median based on whether the total length is even or odd. 

To verify correctness, we can consider the following:

1. **Merging and Sorting**: The given test cases demonstrate the function is correctly merging and sorting the provided lists:
   - For the first test case, merging [1, 12, 15, 26, 38] and [2, 13, 17, 30, 45] results in [1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45], which has a median of 16.0.
   - For the second test case, merging [2, 4, 8, 9] and [7, 13, 19, 28] results in [2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 19, 28], yielding a median of 8.5.
   - The third test case also confirms this behavior.

2. **Even and Odd Lengths**: The logic for calculating the median for both even-length and odd-length combined lists is implemented correctly:
   - It correctly identifies when there are an even number of elements (using the formula for calculating the average of the two middle elements).

3. **Functionality Check**: The function can handle various sizes of lists as indicated by the input examples.

Given that the program passes all specified cases and adheres to the problem description without missing logic or handling of edge cases, it qualifies as correct.
