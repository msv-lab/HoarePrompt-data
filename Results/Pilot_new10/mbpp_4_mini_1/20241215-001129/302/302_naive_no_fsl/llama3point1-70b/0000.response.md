Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, it does not correctly handle the specification of being a sorted array in all cases. 

One potential issue arises when the input array has multiple occurrences of the target number. While the implementation does return the index of the first occurrence in this specific scenario, it also fails to utilize the fact that the array is sorted, which could allow for optimization. But more importantly, the case of an empty array is not handled explicitly in the problem description. 

For instance:
- If we test the function with `arr = []` (an empty array) and any `num`, the function will correctly return `-1` because there is no occurrence of any number. 

However, if we take:
- `arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 1`, the function will return `0`, which is correct because the first occurrence of `1` is at index `0`.
- If we take `arr = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` and `num = 3`, it correctly returns `-1` which indicates that `3` is not present. 

These examples seem correct, but the essence of correctness states a need for the function to explicitly denote and handle a case where values outside the array bounds are given distinctly with no returns inside the array. 

Given the focus on sorted arrays, we could also argue about the performance aspect and cases should be distinguished, which means it might not be entirely optimal.

Further assessment reveals that the program is indeed missing critical checks for edge cases and assumptions about the array state and target number bounds, thus leading to the conclusion that for all edges cases and a sorted concept it fails to meet the completeness of the specification laid out hence marking it as incorrect.

In summary, the logic does not comprehensively address every potential case that could arise in a sorted array based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is marked as **False**.
