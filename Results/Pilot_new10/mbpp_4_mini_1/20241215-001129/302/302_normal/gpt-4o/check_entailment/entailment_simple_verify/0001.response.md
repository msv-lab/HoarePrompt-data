The original assessment correctly analyzes the functionality of the `func_1` function in relation to the problem description of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It illustrates that the implementation uses a binary search approach and assesses the provided test cases, affirming their correctness.

The annotated version of the code further supports this conclusion by describing the states of the variables at critical points in the program. It confirms that the function will return the correct index of the first occurrence if the number exists in the sorted array, or `-1` if it does not. The explanations provided in the annotations are consistent with the expected behavior of the function according to the problem statement.

Therefore, both the original assessment and the annotations align well with the functionality described, affirming the correctness of the `func_1` function.

Final: **True**
