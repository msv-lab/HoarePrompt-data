You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the given program based on the problem description, we need to ensure that the function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

1. The implementation starts by setting up two pointers, `low` and `high`, to perform a binary search.
2. It checks the middle element (`mid`) of the current search space.
3. If the middle element is equal to the target, it records the index and continues searching in the left half of the array (by adjusting `high`) to find the first occurrence.
4. If the middle element is less than the target, it shifts the search space to the right by adjusting `low`.
5. If the middle element is greater than the target, it adjusts `high` to narrow the search space.

Now, let's evaluate if there could be any input case where the program does not meet the requirements:

- Consider the input `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6)`. The function correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of `6`, which is at index `4`.
- For `func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`, it also finds the first occurrence at index `1`.
- Similar checks for other test cases provided show that they return the expected results.

However, all test cases assume valid inputs:

- What if the function is tested with an empty array, like `func_1([], 5)`? The current implementation does not handle this case, and would return `-1`, which is technically not wrong but doesn't explicitly state how it treats searches in empty arrays. This suggests the function doesn't account for or define behavior when there are no elements. 

Thus, we have found a potential case where the function might not properly handle inputs as per the description because it doesn't specify behavior for an empty array or a target not present in the array.

Based on this reasoning, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers in sorted order, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, `result` is the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` exists in `arr`; otherwise, `result` remains -1. If `target` is not found, `low` is equal to the position in `arr` where `target` would be if it were inserted while maintaining sorted order.
    return result
    #The program returns the index of the first occurrence of 'target' in 'arr' if 'target' exists; otherwise, it returns -1, and if 'target' is not found, 'low' is equal to the position in 'arr' where 'target' would be inserted while maintaining sorted order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers, `arr`, and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find and return the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` does not exist in the list, the function returns -1. Additionally, the position where `target` could be inserted to maintain sorted order corresponds to the value of `low` at the end of the search, but this position is not directly returned. Therefore, if `target` is not in the list, the function does not indicate the insertion point and simply returns -1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
