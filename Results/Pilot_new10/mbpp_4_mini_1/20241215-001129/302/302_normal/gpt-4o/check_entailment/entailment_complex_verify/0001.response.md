Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly evaluates the functionality of the `func_1` function in relation to the given problem description. The function effectively implements binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array. The annotations confirm the expected behavior of the program at different stages, ensuring that the function consistently returns the correct index or `-1` when the target is not present. Additionally, the assessment's discussion of key test cases and edge cases aligns with the expected outcomes of the function. Therefore, the correctness of the program is upheld based on the information provided.
