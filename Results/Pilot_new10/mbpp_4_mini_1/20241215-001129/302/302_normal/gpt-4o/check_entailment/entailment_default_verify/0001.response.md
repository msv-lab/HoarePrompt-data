The original assessment accurately describes the functionality of `func_1`. It correctly identifies that the function implements binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of the target number in a sorted array. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function correctly handles various test cases, including successful finds and correctly returning `-1` when the target is absent from the array.

Even though the output hints mention that the insertion point could be indicated by the value of `low` at the end of the search if the target is not found, the function fulfills the problem's requirement by returning the correct index for the first occurrence of a number or `-1` if not found, which aligns with the assessment.

All necessary edge cases have been accounted for in the original assessment, confirming that the function operates as intended.

Therefore, my final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
