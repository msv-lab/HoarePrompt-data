Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, and `mid` is equal to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`. The element at index `mid` in `arr` is not equal to `target`, and the current value of `arr[mid]` is less than `target`.***
