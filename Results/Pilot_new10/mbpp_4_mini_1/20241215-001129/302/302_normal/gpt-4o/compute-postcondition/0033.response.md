Functionality: ** The function accepts a sorted list of integers, `arr`, and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find and return the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` does not exist in the list, the function returns -1. Additionally, the position where `target` could be inserted to maintain sorted order corresponds to the value of `low` at the end of the search, but this position is not directly returned. Therefore, if `target` is not in the list, the function does not indicate the insertion point and simply returns -1. **
