The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, the new value of `high` is the index just before `mid`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and since `result` is equal to `mid` which is referenced to the previous midpoint, it remains the same. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is now `mid - 1`, `result` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is equal to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is now `mid - 1`, `result` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is equal to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`.**
