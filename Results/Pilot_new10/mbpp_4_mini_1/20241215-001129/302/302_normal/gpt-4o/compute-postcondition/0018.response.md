The variable `low` is updated to be one greater than the current value of `mid`. The previous value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which means after incrementing `low`, the condition `low <= high` might still remain valid, depending on the specific values. The states of the other variables (`arr`, `target`, `high`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2` before the increment. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` is now `mid + 1`, and `mid` was equal to `(low + high) // 2` before the increment.**
