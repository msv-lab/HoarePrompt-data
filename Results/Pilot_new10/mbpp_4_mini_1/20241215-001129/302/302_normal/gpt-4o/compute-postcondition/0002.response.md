According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, which means `high` represents the last index of the array.

For the loop to execute at least once, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. Since `low` is 0 and `high` being `len(arr) - 1` is at least 0 (assuming `arr` is not empty), the current states allow the loop to execute.

No modifications to the states are necessary because the conditions for the loop to execute are already met.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1, `result` is -1**
