`low` is updated to the value of `mid + 1`. The values of `arr`, `target`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged. However, since `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, this would mean that `low` is being moved to the right by one position in the sorted array, allowing for the search to continue in the upper half of the list.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `high` remains less than or equal to `high, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, now `low` is `mid + 1`.**
