The value of `result` is assigned to be equal to `mid`. The values of `arr`, `target`, `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged as a result of this operation. The output state reflects that `result` is now defined as `mid`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` remains less than or equal to `high, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `result` is equal to `mid`.**
