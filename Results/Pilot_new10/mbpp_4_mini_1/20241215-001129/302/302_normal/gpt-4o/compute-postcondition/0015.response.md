The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`, which represents the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values will depend on the previous values of `low` and `high`, but without specific numeric values given, we conclude that `mid` is calculated based on `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` remains less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
