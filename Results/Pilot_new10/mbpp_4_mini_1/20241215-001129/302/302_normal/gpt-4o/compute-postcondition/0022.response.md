According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between the variables `low` and `high`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, which means the loop can execute again without any adjustments necessary.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, and `low` remains less than or equal to `high.**
