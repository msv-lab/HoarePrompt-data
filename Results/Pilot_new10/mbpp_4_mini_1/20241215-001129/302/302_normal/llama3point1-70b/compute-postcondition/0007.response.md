According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `arr`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and the last iteration returned a value when `i` was 1, it indicates that `i` now needs to be incremented to continue the loop. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 2. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. Since the list has at least 2 elements, `i` should be updated to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `x` must be the third element in `arr`**
