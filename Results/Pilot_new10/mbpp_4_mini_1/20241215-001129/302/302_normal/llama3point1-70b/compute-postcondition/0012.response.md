The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `num`. The parameter `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `num` is an integer. After executing the function body, the following cases can occur: 

- Case 1: If the first element in the sorted list `arr` is equal to `num`, the function returns the index `i`, which is currently 0.
- Case 2: If the second element in the list is equal to `num`, the function returns the value of `i`, which is 1.
- Case 3: If the third element in the list is equal to `num`, the function returns the value of `i`, which is 2.
- Case 4: If `num` is not found in the sorted list of integers `arr`, the function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, and return the index of `num` in `arr` if found; otherwise, it returns -1 if `num` is not present in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, returning the index of `num` in `arr` if found, or -1 if `num` is not present.**
