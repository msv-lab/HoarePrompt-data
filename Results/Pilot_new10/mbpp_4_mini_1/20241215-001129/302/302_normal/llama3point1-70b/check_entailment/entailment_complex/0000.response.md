Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the reasoning for its correctness:

1. **Input**: The function accepts two arguments: a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`.
  
2. **Functionality**: 
   - It iterates through the elements of the list using `enumerate`, which gives both the index (`i`) and the value (`x`) of each element.
   - The function checks if the current value `x` is equal to the target number `num`.
   - If a match is found, it immediately returns the index `i` of the first occurrence of `num`.

3. **Return value when not found**: If the loop completes without finding `num`, it returns -1, indicating that `num` is not present in the list.

4. **Sorted list consideration**: Although the array is sorted, the function does not use this property to optimize searching. However, the problem description does not mandate that an optimized approach be implemented; it simply requires finding the first occurrence of a number, which the function does correctly.

5. **Behavior with duplicates**: The function correctly handles duplicates by returning the index of the first occurrence, which satisfies the requirements of the problem.

6. **Empty list handling**: If the input list is empty, the function will also correctly return -1, as there are no elements to match against.

In summary, the function meets the problem requirements by returning the correct index of the first occurrence of `num` or -1 when `num` is not found, thus adhering to the description given.
