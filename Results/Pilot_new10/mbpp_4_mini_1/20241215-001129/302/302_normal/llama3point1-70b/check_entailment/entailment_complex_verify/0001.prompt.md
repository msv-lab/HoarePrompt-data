You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, it does not correctly handle the specification of being a sorted array in all cases. 

One potential issue arises when the input array has multiple occurrences of the target number. While the implementation does return the index of the first occurrence in this specific scenario, it also fails to utilize the fact that the array is sorted, which could allow for optimization. But more importantly, the case of an empty array is not handled explicitly in the problem description. 

For instance:
- If we test the function with `arr = []` (an empty array) and any `num`, the function will correctly return `-1` because there is no occurrence of any number. 

However, if we take:
- `arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 1`, the function will return `0`, which is correct because the first occurrence of `1` is at index `0`.
- If we take `arr = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` and `num = 3`, it correctly returns `-1` which indicates that `3` is not present. 

These examples seem correct, but the essence of correctness states a need for the function to explicitly denote and handle a case where values outside the array bounds are given distinctly with no returns inside the array. 

Given the focus on sorted arrays, we could also argue about the performance aspect and cases should be distinguished, which means it might not be entirely optimal.

Further assessment reveals that the program is indeed missing critical checks for edge cases and assumptions about the array state and target number bounds, thus leading to the conclusion that for all edges cases and a sorted concept it fails to meet the completeness of the specification laid out hence marking it as incorrect.

In summary, the logic does not comprehensively address every potential case that could arise in a sorted array based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is marked as **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` or indicates that `num` is not in `arr`, and if `num` is not found, there is no return value from the function.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that `num` is not found in the sorted list of integers `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`. It returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` if found; otherwise, it returns -1 if `num` is not present in the list. There are no checks for duplicate values, so if there are multiple occurrences of `num`, it always returns the index of the first one. If the list is empty, the function will return -1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
