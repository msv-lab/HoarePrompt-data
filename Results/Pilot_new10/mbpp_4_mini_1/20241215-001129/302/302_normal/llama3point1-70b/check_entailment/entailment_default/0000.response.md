Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the task of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function uses the `enumerate` function to iterate through the list, and when it finds the number `num`, it returns its index immediately.

From the output hints, we see that if the number `num` is present in the list, the function returns the index of its first occurrence, which aligns with the problem description. If the number is not found, the function correctly returns -1. Additionally, if the input list is empty, it also correctly returns -1, as there are no elements to search through.

There are no edge cases where the function would fail to meet the requirements of the problem as described, including handling of duplicates, which is explicitly stated in the output hints. Hence, the code meets the problem description for all potential cases. 

Overall, the program behaves correctly for any input according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
