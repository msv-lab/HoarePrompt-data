Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case:

1. **Finding the Index**: The function iterates through the sorted list `arr` and returns the index of the first occurrence of the given number `num` when a match is found.
   
2. **Handling Duplicates**: Since the problem description specifies returning only the first occurrence, the program behaves correctly by returning the index of the first matching element.

3. **Return -1 for Non-existent Element**: If `num` is not found in the list, the program correctly returns -1.

4. **Empty List**: If the input list `arr` is empty, the function will also correctly return -1, as there are no elements to search through.

Since there are no missing logic branches or unhandled edge cases when considering the output hints, the code correctly addresses the problem description. Thus, we can conclude it is correct in all cases.
