Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Although it correctly iterates through the array and returns the index of the first occurrence of the number, it does not adequately take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted.

In a sorted array, it is more efficient to use a binary search approach to find the first occurrence of a number. The current program uses a linear search, which is less efficient, especially for larger arrays. Additionally, if the array contains multiple occurrences of the number, the program will return the index of the first occurrence correctly; however, the efficiency is not optimal.

Thus, while the program may provide the correct result for some inputs, it does not fulfill the implicit requirement suggested by the problem description to use a method that leverages the sorted nature of the input array for potentially better performance. As such, it is not adhering fully to what the problem description implies in terms of optimality and correctness in handling the sorted input.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the correct expectations set by the problem description.
