Final: **True** 

The original assessment has been reconsidered, and it is found to be inaccurate. The program correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, even in cases of duplicates. The annotated code confirms the state of the variables and that the logic handles all specified scenarios per the problem description effectively. It checks each element in the array in a linear fashion and returns the index appropriately, or -1 if the number is not found, meaning that all criteria have been fulfilled as stipulated in the problem statement.
