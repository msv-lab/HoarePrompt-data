To analyze the given program based on the problem description, we need to ensure that the function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

1. The implementation starts by setting up two pointers, `low` and `high`, to perform a binary search.
2. It checks the middle element (`mid`) of the current search space.
3. If the middle element is equal to the target, it records the index and continues searching in the left half of the array (by adjusting `high`) to find the first occurrence.
4. If the middle element is less than the target, it shifts the search space to the right by adjusting `low`.
5. If the middle element is greater than the target, it adjusts `high` to narrow the search space.

Now, let's evaluate if there could be any input case where the program does not meet the requirements:

- Consider the input `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6)`. The function correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of `6`, which is at index `4`.
- For `func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`, it also finds the first occurrence at index `1`.
- Similar checks for other test cases provided show that they return the expected results.

However, all test cases assume valid inputs:

- What if the function is tested with an empty array, like `func_1([], 5)`? The current implementation does not handle this case, and would return `-1`, which is technically not wrong but doesn't explicitly state how it treats searches in empty arrays. This suggests the function doesn't account for or define behavior when there are no elements. 

Thus, we have found a potential case where the function might not properly handle inputs as per the description because it doesn't specify behavior for an empty array or a target not present in the array.

Based on this reasoning, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
