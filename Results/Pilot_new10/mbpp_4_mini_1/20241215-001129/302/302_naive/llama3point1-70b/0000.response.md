Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has a logical flaw when handling cases where the `num` is not present in the input `arr`. Specifically, since the problem description states it should find the first occurrence of a given number in a **sorted** array, the code should account for the possible presence of duplicates and return the index of the first occurrence.

Here's a key case where the program does not return the correct index:
- For a sorted array `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 2`, the expected output is `1` (the index of the first occurrence of `2`). 
- The program correctly finds `2` at index `1` and returns `1`.

However, consider the case:
- For a sorted array `arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 1`, the expected output is `0`, but the program will return `0` correctly as per the current implementation and works as intended.

Yet, if we instead consider an array with no repeating elements like `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]` for `num = 5`, the result is `-1`, which is also the expected behavior since `5` is not in the list.

The code works fine in the example tested, however, on observing multiple possibilities like when multiple occurrences but it returns the first index which is correct according to the description. 

Therefore, there is no evident bug when assessing multiple cases including duplicates or absence in such sorted array context. The program should cover all potential scenarios based upon the algorithmâ€™s linear search through sorted elements.

Hence, given my elaborated exploration and no visible flaws despite covered cases, and how the function operates as intended without implicit issues further abstracted, therefore the decision determines:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array across various test scenarios.
