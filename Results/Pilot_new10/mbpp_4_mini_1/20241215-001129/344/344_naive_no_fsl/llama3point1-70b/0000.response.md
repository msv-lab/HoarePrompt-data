To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, letâ€™s analyze the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem Description**: The function should locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted order.

**Program Implementation**:
```python
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)
```

### Analyzing the Code

1. **Function Behavior**: 
   - The function iterates over the `sorted_list`.
   - It checks if an element is greater than or equal to the specified `value`.
   - If such an element is found, it returns the index of that element.
   - If no such element is found, it returns the length of the list, which indicates that the value should be inserted at the end.

2. **Correct Cases**:
   - If `sorted_list` is empty and `value` is `5`, it returns `0`, which is correct.
   - If `sorted_list` is `[1, 3, 5]` and `value` is `4`, it correctly returns `2`, as `4` should be inserted at index `2`.
   - If `sorted_list` is `[1, 3, 5]` and `value` is `5`, it returns `2`, which is correct as `5` should be inserted at index `2`.

3. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: If `sorted_list` is `[1, 3, 5]` and `value` is `6`, it will return `3`, which is correct because `6` should be inserted at the end.
   - **Case 2**: If `sorted_list` is `[-1, 0, 1]` and `value` is `0`, it returns `1`, which is correct since `0` would go between `-1` and `0`.

### Identifying Potential Issues
Now, we will look for any potential edge cases that could cause the implementation to fail:

- **Negative Values and Zeroes**: The code seems to handle negative numbers and zero correctly.
- **Duplicates**: If we have duplicates, it returns the index of the first occurrence that is equal or greater, which is still valid for insertion logic.

### Conclusion
After testing various scenarios, the function appears to handle all tested cases correctly, including edge cases like empty lists, duplicates, and various values compared against the sorted list.

Therefore, I cannot identify any cases where the implementation fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
