#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of sorted integers, and value is an integer.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the insertion point in 'sorted_list' where 'value' can be inserted to maintain sorted order, using the bisect_right algorithm from the bisect module.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of sorted integers and an integer value, and returns the insertion point in the list where the value can be inserted to maintain sorted order. It utilizes the `bisect_right` method from the bisect module to determine this position, ensuring that the resulting list remains sorted even with duplicate values. There are no visible edge cases or missing functionality based on the annotated code and the algorithm being used.
