Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not entirely meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method to determine the insertion point for the specified value within a sorted list. 

However, according to the problem description, the function should locate the right insertion point in sorted order for a specified value. The `bisect_right` function returns the insertion point to the right of any existing entries of the value, not the exact position where the value should be inserted if it is not already present. 

For example, given a sorted list `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and a value `4`, `bisect_right` will return `3`, indicating that `4` can be placed to the right of any existing `4` (which does not exist in the list) at index `2`. The expected insertion point for `4` to maintain sorted order should actually be index `2`, not index `3`.

Thus, the function does not behave correctly for cases where the value is already present in the list, failing to adhere to the correct interpretation of the problem description. Therefore, it does not satisfy all potential cases outlined in the requirement.
