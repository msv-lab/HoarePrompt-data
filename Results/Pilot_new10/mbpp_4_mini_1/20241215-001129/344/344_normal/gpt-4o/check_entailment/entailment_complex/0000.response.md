Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted order. It accepts a list of sorted integers (`sorted_list`) and an integer value (`value`), which is precisely what the problem description asks for.

2. **Algorithm Utilization**: The function utilizes the `bisect.bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module. This method identifies the insertion point in a given sorted list where the new value can be placed while maintaining the sorted order. This aligns perfectly with the goal of maintaining order in the list, including handling duplicates correctly.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided serve as test cases, confirming that the function behaves as expected for various scenarios. The outcomes of these assertions demonstrate that:
   - Inserting `6` into `[1, 2, 4, 5]` results in an insertion index of `4`, meaning it would be placed at the end of the list.
   - Inserting `3` results in an index of `2`, indicating that `3` should be inserted between `2` and `4`.
   - Inserting `7` again results in an index of `4`, consistent with it being greater than all current elements.

4. **No Edge Cases Missing**: The commentary within the code suggests that there are no visible edge cases or missing functionalities based on the usage of `bisect_right` for maintaining sorted order, thus fulfilling the requirement effectively for all potential cases of insertion.

In summary, the function correctly identifies insertion points, accurately reflecting the behavior required by the problem description, which confirms its correctness.
