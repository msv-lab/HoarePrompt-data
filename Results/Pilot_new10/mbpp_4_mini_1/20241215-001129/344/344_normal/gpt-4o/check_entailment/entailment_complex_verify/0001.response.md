The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it uses `bisect.bisect_right`, which returns the position to insert the given `value` to the right of any existing entries in `sorted_list`. The reasoning given was that the expected behavior is to return the position of the first occurrence of the `value` when it is already present in the list, rather than the position after the last occurrence (which is what `bisect_right` provides). 

However, the problem description requests a function that locates the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The use of `bisect.bisect_right` is correct as it provides the proper insertion index while maintaining the sorted order, even in the presence of duplicates, as noted in the annotations. Notably, the comments explicitly state that the function returns the insertion point where `value` can be inserted to maintain sorted order, utilizing the `bisect_right` method to ensure that the resulting list remains sorted.

Given this clarification from the annotations and the established functionality of `bisect.bisect_right`, the assessment that the program is incorrect does not hold. The annotations confirm that the behavior of the program adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Final: **True**
