#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list`, and all elements of `sorted_list` are less than `value` (if `sorted_list` is not empty).
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of 'sorted_list', which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and all elements are less than 'value'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers and an integer value, and it returns the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the value. If all elements are less than the value, it returns the length of the list.
