Given the provided initial state and the loop code, let's analyze how the variables change after the loop executes completely.

### Initial State:
- `sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `value` is an integer.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
    if sorted_list[i] >= value:
        return i
```

### Analysis of the Loop Execution:
1. The loop iterates through each index `i` of `sorted_list`.
2. It checks whether the element at index `i` in `sorted_list` is greater than or equal to `value`.
3. If it finds such an element, it returns the index `i`. If no such element exists by the end of the loop, it does not return anything.

### Output State After the Loop Executes:
- If the loop executes all the way without returning early, it means none of the elements in `sorted_list` are greater than or equal to `value`.
- The loop will execute 0 times if `sorted_list` is empty. 
- Based on the results we want to achieve, let's summarize possible states:

1. If `sorted_list` is empty:
   - `sorted_list` is an empty list, and there is no element to compare to `value`.
   - Output State: **`sorted_list` is an empty list, the loop did not execute.**

2. If `sorted_list` has elements but none of them are greater than or equal to `value`:
   - `sorted_list` must contain at least one integer.
   - `i` will end at the length of `sorted_list` with no valid return (the function returns None).
   - Output State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list` (indicating the index reached after all iterations), and all elements of `sorted_list` are less than `value`.**

3. If the loop executed at least once and found an element meeting the criterion, it would have returned early, so we do not reach this state after the loop completes.

Putting this all together, the final output state after all iterations can be concluded:

Output State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list`, and all elements of `sorted_list` are less than `value` (if `sorted_list` is not empty).**
