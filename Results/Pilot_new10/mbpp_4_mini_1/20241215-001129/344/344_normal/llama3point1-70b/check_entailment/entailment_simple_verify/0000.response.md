Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The logic of the program effectively finds the first index where the sorted list element is greater than or equal to the specified value, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description. 

The annotated version reinforces this by confirming that:
1. If the value is less than any element in the sorted list, it correctly returns an index of `0`.
2. If the value is greater than all elements, it appropriately returns the length of the list, indicating that the value should be placed at the end.
3. If the value equals a specific element in the list, it returns the correct index as required.

Thus, all edge cases are accounted for, per the original assessment, affirming the correctness of the program.
