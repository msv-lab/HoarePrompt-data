You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

**Problem description:** Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Rounding Numbers:** The code correctly rounds each number in the input list using the `round()` function and constructs a new list called `rounded_numbers`.
2. **Calculating Total Sum:** It then calculates the sum of the rounded numbers.
3. **Multiplying by Length:** Finally, it multiplies the total sum by the length of the input list (`len(numbers)`).

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Empty List: If `numbers` is an empty list (`[]`), the length will be 0, leading to a multiplication of the sum (which is 0) by 0, resulting in 0. This case is correctly handled.
- Mixed Values: If the list contains negative, positive, or float values, they are rounded appropriately, and the sum is computed accurately.
- Non-integer numbers: The `round()` function handles non-integer floating-point numbers correctly.

### Test Cases:
1. **Empty List:** 
   - Input: `[]`
   - Output: `0 * 0 = 0` (which is correct)
   
2. **Positive and Negative Values:** 
   - Input: `[1.4, 2.5, -3.2]`
   - Rounding results in `[1, 3, -3]`, sum = `1 + 3 - 3` = `1`, and multiplying by the length (3) gives `1 * 3 = 3`.

3. **All Zeros:** 
   - Input: `[0, 0, 0]`
   - Rounding stays `[0, 0, 0]`, total sum = `0`, and output is `0 * 3 = 0`.

4. **Non-integer Floats:**
   - Input: `[1.5, 2.4, 3.6]`
   - Rounding results in `[2, 2, 4]`, sum = `2 + 2 + 4` = `8`, output = `8 * 3 = 24`.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles rounding of numbers, summation, and multiplication by the length of the list, accounting for different possible input scenarios. 

Since no potential input case has been found where the program does not behave as expected, we can conclude that the program meets the problem requirements in all scenarios.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of real numbers and returns the product of the sum of the rounded values of those numbers and the total count of numbers in the list. It does not handle empty lists separately, and the product will be zero if the list is empty, as `len(numbers)` would be zero, leading to a return value of zero in that case. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
