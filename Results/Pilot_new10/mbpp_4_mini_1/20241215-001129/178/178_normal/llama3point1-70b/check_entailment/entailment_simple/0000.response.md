Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here is the explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a parameter `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of real numbers. This matches the expectation described in the problem statement.

2. **Rounding of Numbers**: The program uses a list comprehension to round each number in the list to the nearest integer with the expression `rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]`. This aligns with the requirement to round every number in the list.

3. **Calculation of Total Sum**: The program computes the sum of the rounded numbers with `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)`. This step is clearly stated in the problem requirements.

4. **Multiplication by the Length of the List**: Finally, the program returns the product of the `total_sum` and the length of the original list with the expression `return total_sum * len(numbers)`. The length of the list is correctly calculated using `len(numbers)`, and the multiplication is done as specified in the problem.

5. **Output**: The function correctly returns the final computed value, adhering to the specification of performing calculations based on the list provided.

Since the function fulfills all the tasks specified in the problem description and operates correctly on any list of real numbers, it is deemed correct.
