Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here's how the function works according to those requirements:

1. **Input**: The function `func_1` takes a list of real numbers as input, which is in line with the problem description.
2. **Rounding**: It rounds each number in the list using a list comprehension and the built-in `round` function. This aligns with the requirement to round every number in the provided list.
3. **Total Sum Calculation**: The function then calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers using the `sum` function, which is also a step required by the problem description.
4. **Multiplied by Length**: Finally, it multiplies the total sum by the length of the original list of numbers. This is consistent with the problem statement, which specifies that the final output should be the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.

Moreover, the program handles an edge case where if the list is empty, the length will be zero, leading to a return value of zero, which is logically sound since the sum of an empty list is also zero. Thus, the function correctly satisfies the problem description for all potential cases stated, confirming that it will provide the desired calculations as required. 

Therefore, the program is correct and fulfills the problem's requirements.
