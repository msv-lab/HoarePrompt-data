Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program's logic was incorrect due to a potential ZeroDivisionError when dealing with an empty list. However, based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the assumption is made that the input will always be valid and will not be empty. Since there is no indication that the function needs to handle the empty list scenario (and the program operates under the assumption of valid input), the function correctly implements the requested behavior. Thus, the conclusion that the program is "correct" stands firm, as it performs intended operations correctly under the outlined assumptions.
