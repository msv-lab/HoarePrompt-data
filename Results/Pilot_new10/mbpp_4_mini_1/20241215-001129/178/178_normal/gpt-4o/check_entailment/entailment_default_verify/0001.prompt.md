You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement to round each number in the provided list, sum those rounded values, and then multiply the total sum by the length of the list. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Rounding**: The code uses the `round()` function, which is appropriate for rounding each number in the list.
2. **Summing**: The `sum()` function is used to calculate the total of the rounded numbers.
3. **Length**: The length of the list is obtained using `len(numbers)`, which correctly gives the count of the original list elements.
4. **Final Output**: The final result is calculated by multiplying the total sum of rounded numbers by the length of the original list, which follows the specified requirement.

All provided test cases yield the correct results:
- For `[22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]`, rounding would yield `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]` resulting in a sum of `27`, and then `27 * 9 = 243`.
- For `[5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]`, rounding results in `[5, 2, 9, 24, 29]` for a sum of `69`, and then `69 * 5 = 345`.
- For `[25.0, 56.7, 89.2]`, the rounded numbers are `[25, 57, 89]` for a sum of `171`, and then `171 * 3 = 513`.

Therefore, I was unable to identify any cases where the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Hence, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of numerical values (integers or floats) and returns the product of the total sum of these numbers after rounding each number to the nearest integer and the length of the list. It does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which would lead to a multiplication by zero in the returned result. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
