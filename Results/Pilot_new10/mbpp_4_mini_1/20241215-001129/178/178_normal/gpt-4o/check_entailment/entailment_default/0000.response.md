Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` rounds each number in the input list and calculates the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. However, as per the output hints, the function does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If an empty list is provided, the length of the list would be zero, leading to a multiplication by zero, thus resulting in an output of zero. This violates the problem statement which implies that it should be able to process any list of numbers, including possibly empty lists, without raising unexpected behavior. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
