Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly rounds every number in the given list and calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers. It then multiplies this total sum by the length of the list, which is in line with the problem description. 

The process can be summarized as follows:
1. Each number in the list is rounded using the built-in `round()` function.
2. The rounded numbers are summed up.
3. The sum is then multiplied by the length of the original list of numbers.

I have evaluated different potential cases, including empty lists, lists of positive numbers, negative numbers, and different numerical values (like fractional numbers). The code handles these scenarios correctly and returns the expected results. Thus, there are no cases where it fails to perform as described.
