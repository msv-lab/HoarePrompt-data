Postcondition: ***`frequency` is a non-empty dictionary with at least one additional item, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `n` is a non-negative integer. If `count` is greater than `int(digit)`, the function returns False, indicating that a specific condition has not been met. If `count` is less than or equal to `int(digit)`, the function does not return anything.***
