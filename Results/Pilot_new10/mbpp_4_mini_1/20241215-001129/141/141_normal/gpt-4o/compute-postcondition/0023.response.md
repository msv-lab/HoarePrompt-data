Postcondition: ***`frequency` is a non-empty dictionary with at least one additional item, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `n` is a non-negative integer. If `count` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not perform any return action.***
