The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function evaluates several conditions and returns values accordingly: 

- Case 1: If a specific condition is met, the program returns `False`.
- Case 2: If another condition is met, the program returns `False`.
- Case 3: If a different specific condition is not met, the program returns `False`.
- Case 4: If for every digit in the frequency dictionary, its count is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit, the program returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return:
- `False` for the first three specific cases if certain conditions are not satisfied,
- `True` if the count of each digit in the frequency dictionary is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a non-negative integer, and returns `False` for various conditions not being met or `True` if every digit's count in the frequency dictionary is less than or equal to the digit's integer value.**
