Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not handle invalid inputs, specifically negative integers, since the problem description states that the function should only accept non-negative integers. If a negative integer is provided, the function will attempt to convert it to a string and process it without any safeguards, leading to potentially incorrect behavior.

For example, if we input `-123`, the function will count the digits `1`, `2`, and `3` but will not account for the negative sign, leading to incorrect frequency counts and outputs. Therefore, the function fails to adhere to the requirements stipulated in the problem description, warranting the verdict of incorrectness.
