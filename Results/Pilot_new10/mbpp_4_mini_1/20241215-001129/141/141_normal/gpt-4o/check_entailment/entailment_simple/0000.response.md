Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the program to confirm that it adheres to the specified requirements.

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes an integer n and converts it into a string to facilitate the processing of its individual digits.

2. **Digit Frequency Counting**: A dictionary named `frequency` is constructed to count how many times each digit appears in the input integer. The program iterates through each character in the string representation of `n`, updating the count for each digit properly.

3. **Frequency Validation**: After the frequency count is complete, the program checks if the frequency of each digit (stored in the `frequency` dictionary) is less than or equal to the digit itself. This is done by iterating through the `frequency` items and comparing the count to the integer value of the digit:

   ```python
   if count > int(digit):
       return False
   ```

4. **Return Statement**: If all digits satisfy the condition that their frequency is less than or equal to their respective values, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

5. **Testing with Assertions**: The provided assertions test specific cases:
   - `func_1(1234)` should return True (1 occurs 1 time, 2 occurs 1 time, 3 occurs 1 time, 4 occurs 1 time), which is valid since counts are less than or equal to digit values.
   - `func_1(51241)` should return False (for instance, the digit 1 appears 2 times, which is greater than its value of 1).
   - `func_1(321)` should return True (3 occurs 1 time, 2 occurs 1 time, 1 occurs 1 time), and all counts are valid.

The program consistently evaluates the condition defined in the problem statement for any non-negative integer provided. Therefore, it meets the requirements established in the problem description, making it correct. 

Thus, the final verdict on the program's correctness is:  
Correctness: **True**
