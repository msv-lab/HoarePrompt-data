#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, if the loop executes then for every `digit` in `str_n`, the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. If the loop does not execute, the condition holds trivially since there are no `digit` characters to evaluate.
    return True
    #The program returns True, confirming that the condition holds for each digit in the string representation of the non-negative integer n or trivially holds if n is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if, for each digit in its string representation, the count of that digit does not exceed its integer value. It returns `False` if any digit occurs more times than its value; otherwise, it returns `True`. This includes the case where `n` is 0, which trivially satisfies the condition.
