Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if, for each digit in its string representation, the count of that digit does not exceed its integer value. It returns `False` if any digit occurs more times than its value; otherwise, it returns `True`. This includes the case where `n` is 0, which trivially satisfies the condition. **
