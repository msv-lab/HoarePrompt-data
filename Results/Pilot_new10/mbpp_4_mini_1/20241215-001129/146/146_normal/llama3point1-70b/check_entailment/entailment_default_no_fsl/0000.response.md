Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty or when all the sublists are empty. If the input list is empty, calling `max()` on an empty iterable will raise a `ValueError`, as indicated in the output hints. For example, invoking `func_1([])` will raise an error due to the absence of any sublists to evaluate. 

Additionally, if the input consists of sublists that are all empty (e.g., `[[], []]`), the program attempts to find the maximum length of the sublists, which will also lead to the same error. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is indeed false.
