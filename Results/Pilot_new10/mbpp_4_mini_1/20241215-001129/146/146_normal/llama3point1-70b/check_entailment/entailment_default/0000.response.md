Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code is not correct because it does not handle the case when the input `list_of_lists` is empty or when it contains only empty sublists. In such cases, calling `max()` on an empty sequence will raise a `ValueError`, as indicated in the output hints. The output hints also clarify that the function returns the maximum length and the first longest sublist, but in edge cases where there are no valid sublists, this logic fails. Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to a determination of incorrectness.
