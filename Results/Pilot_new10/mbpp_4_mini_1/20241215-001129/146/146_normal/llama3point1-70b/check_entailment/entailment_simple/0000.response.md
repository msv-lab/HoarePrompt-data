Correctness: **False**

The program does not completely satisfy the problem description for the following reasons:

1. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of sublists that have the maximum length. However, the program only returns the maximum length and the first sublist from those that have the maximum length, which does not fulfill the requirement of returning a list.
  
2. The program uses `max_sublists[0]` in the return statement, implying that it is only concerned with the first sublist of maximum length rather than all sublists of that length. This contradicts the requirement to find and return all sublists of maximum length.

In summary, the function should return all sublists of maximum length in a list instead of a single sublist and the length itself. Thus, the program does not follow the problem description.
