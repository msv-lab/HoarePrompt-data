The code assigns the value of `lst` to `max_list`. Since `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` will now hold the values of that specific sublist. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_len` is a positive integer equal to `len(lst)`; `max_list` is equal to `lst`; `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist; `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
