According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, the loop can execute again for the second sublist. At the end of the last iteration, `max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, and `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. To allow the loop to execute one more time, we must have at least 2 sublists in `list_of_lists`, and `lst` should be the second sublist. 

State: **`max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `list_of_lists` must have at least 2 sublists**
