The variable `max_len` is being initialized to `0`. Since no other operations were performed on the other variables or states in this snippet, the only change in the state is the assignment of `0` to `max_len`. The state of `list_of_lists` remains unchanged as no calculations or modifications were made to it.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can contain any type of elements; `max_len` is 0.**
