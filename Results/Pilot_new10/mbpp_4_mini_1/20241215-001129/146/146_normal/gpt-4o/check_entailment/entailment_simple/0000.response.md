Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for multiple reasons:

1. **Return Type**: The problem description states that the function must find the "list of maximum length" from a list of lists. The expected return is a single list which is the longest sublist, but the actual implementation returns a tuple containing the length of the sublist and the sublist itself. This deviates from what the problem description indicates.

2. **Expected Output Format**: The examples in the assertions indicate that the function should return the longest sublist directly, not as part of a tuple. For example, for the input `[[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`, the expected format based on the description should simply be `[13, 15, 17]`, but the program returns `(3, [13, 15, 17])`.

3. **Handling of edge cases**: The program does consider empty lists by returning `0` and an empty list when `list_of_lists` is empty, which is appropriate. However, the primary functionality of determining the maximum length sublist is compromised by the incorrect output format.

Thus, the main issue here is the discrepancy in the expected output format against what is implemented. The function should only return the longest sublist rather than a tuple containing its length and the sublist.
