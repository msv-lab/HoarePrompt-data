Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. In such a scenario, the expected output should be (0, []), indicating a length of 0 and an empty list as there are no sublists to process. However, since the code does not explicitly check for an empty input list, it will still return (0, []), which does match the output hints. Given that the description states the function should return this result for an empty input, the logic is expected to be present.

However, since it lacks an explicit handling or return for this case, it falls short of being robust. The assumption that it should handle this condition already diminishes the correctness of the code. A more definitive stance is that it does not include necessary validations which can lead to weak handling of inputs, thus leading to potentially incorrect scenarios in terms of clarity and robustnessâ€”even if the output does seem to be correct.

Additionally, it is important to note the logic should also ideally include proper tests or assertions for this empty list case as well to ensure its correctness across all situations. Therefore, the absence of explicit handling in terms of design leads to the conclusion of incorrectness.
