Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program `func_1` successfully finds the longest sublist from a list of lists and returns its length along with the sublist itself. The assertions provided test a variety of scenarios, and each assertion has produced the correct results as expected from the problem description.

The output hints also reinforce the correctness, noting that if the input list is empty, the program appropriately returns `(0, [])`, which aligns with the expected behavior. Additionally, the handling of cases with multiple lists of the same maximum length to return the last one encountered is a reasonable approach and falls within acceptable behavior.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the program's behavior, and the output hints provided, the final assessment is that the program is correct.
