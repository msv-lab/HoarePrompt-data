Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` correctly finds the longest list in a list of lists and returns its length along with the list itself. It uses a simple iteration to compare each sub-list's length to keep track of the maximum length and the corresponding list.

The assertions provided also test some potential cases:

1. For `[[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`, the longest list is `[13, 15, 17]` with length 3, which is correctly returned.
2. For `[[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]`, the longest list is `[10, 12, 14, 15]` with length 4, which is also correctly returned.
3. For `[[5], [15, 20, 25]]`, the longest list is `[15, 20, 25]` with length 3, correctly returned again.

The program would also work for edge cases:
- If provided an empty list of lists, it should return `(0, [])`, representing that there are no lists and hence the maximum length is 0 with no actual list.
- If there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, it returns the last one encountered due to the structure of the code, which is a reasonable approach.

Since I couldn't find any specific example where the program fails to comply with the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
