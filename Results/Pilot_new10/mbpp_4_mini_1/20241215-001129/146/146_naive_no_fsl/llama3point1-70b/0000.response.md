To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem description and the implementation. 

**Problem description**: The task is to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.

**Program analysis**:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists[0])
```

### Steps of the program:
1. It calculates `max_len`, the length of the longest sublist in the given `list_of_lists`.
2. It builds a list `max_sublists` containing all the sublists that have this maximum length.
3. It returns a tuple containing `max_len` and the first sublist from `max_sublists`.

### Potential cases to consider:
1. **Empty input list**: If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max()` would throw a `ValueError` because the function does not have any elements to compare.
2. **Multiple lists of maximum length**: The function only returns the first sublist of maximum length. If the requirement is to return all lists of maximum length, then this does not satisfy that condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the presence of the case where an empty list leads to an error demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**

The program fails if the input list is empty, resulting in an exception rather than a valid output, which does not meet the expectations outlined in the problem description.
