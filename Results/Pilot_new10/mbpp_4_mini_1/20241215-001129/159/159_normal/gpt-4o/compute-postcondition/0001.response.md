The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative floats or integers. The function calculates the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height and returns this volume. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative float or integer `radius` and a non-negative float or integer `height`, and return the volume of a cone based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, both of which are non-negative floats or integers, and returns the volume of a cone calculated using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height.**
