Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are expected to be non-negative floats or integers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. The function does not handle invalid inputs such as negative values or non-numeric types, which could lead to runtime errors.**
