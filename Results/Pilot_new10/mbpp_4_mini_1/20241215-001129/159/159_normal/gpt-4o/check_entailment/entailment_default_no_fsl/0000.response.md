Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle invalid inputs such as negative values or non-numeric types, which could lead to runtime errors. For instance, if we input negative values for `radius` or `height`, the formula still calculates a volume, but mathematically and conceptually, a cone cannot have negative dimensions. Additionally, if non-numeric values are provided, the function will raise a TypeError, which is not addressed in the function logic. This means the function does not meet the complete requirements of the problem description in every potential case.
