The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative integers or floating-point numbers. The function returns the volume of a cone, which is calculated as (1/3) * π * radius² * height. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative integers or floating-point numbers for `radius` and `height` and return the volume of a cone based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative integers or floating-point numbers, and returns the volume of a cone calculated as (1/3) * π * radius² * height.**
