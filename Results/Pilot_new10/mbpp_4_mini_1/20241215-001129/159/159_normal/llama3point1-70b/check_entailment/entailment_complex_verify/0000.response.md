Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone, returning the appropriate result for non-negative integer or floating-point inputs for radius and height. The annotations confirm that the function is designed to accept valid input, specifically noting that both radius and height are non-negative, and it accurately computes the volume based on the provided mathematical formula. Additionally, since the problem description does not specify handling of negative values explicitly and assumes valid inputs, the implementation is considered correct in this context.
