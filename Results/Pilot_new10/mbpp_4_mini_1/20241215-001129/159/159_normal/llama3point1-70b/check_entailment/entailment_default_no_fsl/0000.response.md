Correctness: **False**

The program calculates the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height, which is correct. However, according to the output hints, it does not handle invalid input cases where the `radius` or `height` could be negative or non-numeric. For example, if the function is called with a negative radius or height, or with non-numeric values like a string, it does not produce the correct results and may lead to exceptions. Since the program does not address these scenarios, it fails to meet the problem description's requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
