The program provided is designed to compute the volume of a cone using the formula:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
\]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

The function accepts `radius` and `height` as parameters and correctly applies the formula. However, the provided output hints indicate that the function does not handle invalid input cases, such as when `radius` or `height` is negative or non-numeric.

For example, if the function is called with negative values like `func_1(-1, 5)`, it will not return an error but will instead yield a negative volume, which is nonsensical for the volume of a cone. Therefore, this behavior does not meet the specifications of the problem description that assumes valid inputs.

Since the function does not handle edge cases (negative or non-numeric inputs) according to the problem description's requirements, the function can produce incorrect results or may even raise unexpected exceptions.

Correctness: **False**.
