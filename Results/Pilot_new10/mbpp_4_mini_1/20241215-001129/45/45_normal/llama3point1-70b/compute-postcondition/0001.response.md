The variable `undulating` is set to `True`. The current state of `n`, which is a string representation of a previous positive integer value, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `undulating` is `True` while retaining the original condition of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of the previous positive integer value, `undulating` is True**
