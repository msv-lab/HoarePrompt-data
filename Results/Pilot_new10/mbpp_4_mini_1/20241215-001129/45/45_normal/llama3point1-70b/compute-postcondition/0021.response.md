The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, if all the elements in the string representation of the positive integer `n` are undulating according to the defined conditions, the function returns `True`; if they do not meet the conditions, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True` if the elements of its string representation are undulating according to certain conditions; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer, and returns True if all characters in the string representation of n are undulating according to defined conditions; otherwise, it returns False.**
