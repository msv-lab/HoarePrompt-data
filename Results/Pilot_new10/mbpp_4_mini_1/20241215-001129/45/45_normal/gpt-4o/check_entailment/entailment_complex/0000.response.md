The program is designed to check whether a given number is undulating. An undulating number is one where the digits alternate between two different values, with the first digit of the number taking the even positions and the second digit taking the odd positions.

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly implements the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Minimum Length Check**: The function first checks if the string representation of the number has a length of less than 3. If so, it returns `False`, which is consistent with the expectation that a valid undulating number must have at least three digits to exhibit a pattern of alternation.

2. **First Two Digit Check**: The function then checks if the first two digits of the number are the same. If they are, it returns `False`. This is correct because an undulating number cannot start with the same digit repeating.

3. **Alternating Pattern Verification**: Within the for loop, the function iterates over the remaining digits of the string. It ensures that:
   - Digits at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) match the first digit.
   - Digits at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) match the second digit.

By returning `True` only if all these conditions are satisfied, the function successfully adheres to the criteria of an undulating number. 

Additionally, the test cases provided at the start match the expected returns:
- `func_1(1212121)` returns `True` because it follows the undulating pattern of 1s and 2s.
- `func_1(1991)` returns `False` because it does not alternate correctly.
- `func_1(121)` returns `True` as it forms a valid undulating pattern.

Conclusively, the program meets the problem requirements as described and correctly identifies undulating numbers according to the specified criteria.
