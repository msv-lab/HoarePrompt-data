Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to check if a given number is undulating, meaning it should have alternating digits. However, it fails to account for negative integers and non-integer inputs, which could potentially lead to errors or incorrect outputs in these cases.

For example, if we pass a negative integer like `-1212121`, the string representation would start with a `-`, which would disrupt the expected pattern, and the program has no handling for this scenario. 

Additionally, if a non-integer input such as a string or float is passed, the program would raise a `TypeError` when attempting to convert it to a string or comparing digits. The existence of these issues means the function does not correctly handle all potential cases described in the program description. 

Thus, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, resulting in incorrectness.
