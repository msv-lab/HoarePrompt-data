The variable `first_digit` is assigned the value of the first character in the string `s`, which represents the first digit of the integer `n`. Since `s` is the string representation of `n` and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3, it confirms that the first character will be a valid digit. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, which is a digit.**
