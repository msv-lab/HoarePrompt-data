To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and identify potential edge cases. 

The problem description requires the function to check whether the given number is undulating or not. An undulating number alternates between two different digits. 

Let's examine the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True
```

### Review:
1. The function first converts the number into a string.
2. It checks if the length of that string is less than 3, returning `False` in such cases.
3. Next, it compares the first two characters:
   - If they are the same, it returns `False`, indicating that the number cannot be undulating.
4. The loop starting at index 2 checks each digit based on its position:
   - Even indexed positions should match the first digit,
   - Odd indexed positions should match the second digit.
5. If any of these conditions are violated, it returns `False`.
6. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it returns `True`.

### Testing Cases:
- The assertions provided (`func_1(1212121)`, `func_1(1991)`, and `func_1(121)`) seem to cover various scenarios.

#### Edge Case:
However, let's consider an edge case:
- Input `n = 20202`. This number has a length greater than 3 and the first digit is `2`, the second is `0`, which appears to be undulating at first glance:
   - 0 is in odd positions and 2 is at even positions.
- `func_1(20202)` would return `True`, but it actually does not alternate properly since it ends with `0`, not alternating to a different digit at the last position.

### Conclusion:
This edge case can cause the program to falsely identify a number as undulating when it is not.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
