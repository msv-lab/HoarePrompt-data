Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(n)` properly checks if the given month number `n` (which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 12) is included in the predefined list of months that contain 31 days. The annotations clearly indicate that the function checks membership in the list and returns the correct boolean value based on that membership. Therefore, the program handles the requirements of the problem description fully and accurately, leading to the conclusion that it is correct.
