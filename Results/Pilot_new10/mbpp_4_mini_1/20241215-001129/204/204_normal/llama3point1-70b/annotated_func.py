#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing a month number, where 1 <= n <= 12.
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days
    #The program returns True if n is in the list of months with 31 days [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing a month number (1 to 12) and returns `True` if `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). It returns `False` for all other months, including February and those with 30 days (April, June, September, November).
