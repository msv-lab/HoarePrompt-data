Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether the given month number corresponds to a month with 31 days, but it does not handle the case when the input is outside the range of 1 to 12. According to the problem description, the function must check if the given month number (which is claimed to be an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive) contains 31 days.

If a user were to call `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)`, the function would not return an appropriate response, as those inputs are not valid months. The annotations state that the program assumes an integer input between 1 and 12, but this is not enforced within the function. Thus, it fails to meet the complete specification indicated in the problem description, making it incorrect.
