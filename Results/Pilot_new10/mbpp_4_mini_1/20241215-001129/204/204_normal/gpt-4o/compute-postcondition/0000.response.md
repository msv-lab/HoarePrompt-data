The code initializes a set called `months_with_31_days`, which contains the integers representing months that have 31 days. The variable `month` remains as it is within the range of 1 to 12. No variables are altered by this code, as it simply defines a new set and does not affect the `month` variable.

Output State: **`month` is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive; `months_with_31_days` is {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}**.
