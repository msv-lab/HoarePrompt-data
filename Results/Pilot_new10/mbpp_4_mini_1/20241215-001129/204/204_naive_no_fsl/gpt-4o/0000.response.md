Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the month number is invalid. For example, if `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` is called, the function will return `False`, but there is no clear indication that these inputs are invalid. The requirement is to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not, but the function does not account for invalid month numbers such as 0 or 13, which should ideally raise an error or indicate that the input is invalid. Thus, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
