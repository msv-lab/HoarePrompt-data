#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a new list of lists, where each sublist contains the strings from the original 'list_of_lists' sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists where each sublist contains strings, and returns a new list of lists with each sublist sorted in ascending order. It does not handle cases where the input is not a list or contains non-string elements, which could lead to runtime errors if those inputs are provided.
