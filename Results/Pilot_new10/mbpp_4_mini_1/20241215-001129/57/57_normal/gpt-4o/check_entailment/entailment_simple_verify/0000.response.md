The original assessment states that the program `func_1` is incorrect because it does not produce the expected output as indicated in the assertion statements. Specifically, the assessment points to the output of the call with input `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])`, arguing that the expected output given in the assert statement is erroneous (`[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`). 

However, let's analyze the code further:
1. The function `func_1` sorts each sublist of strings in ascending order, which is correctly implemented.
2. The expected outputs in the assertion statements do not actually match the sorted results accurately.

For the input `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])`, the correct output should indeed be:
- `['green', 'orange']` (which is already sorted)
- `['black', 'white']` (which is already sorted)
- `['black', 'orange', 'white']` (this is correctly sorted to `['black', 'orange', 'white']`, contradicting the output in the assertion)

The assertion incorrectly states that the expected output is `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which indicates that the third sublist is not sorted correctly according to normal sorting rules. 

Given this analysis:
- The function `func_1` actually fulfills the problem description requirements correctly when it sorts each sublist.
- The original assessment incorrectly stated that the function is incorrect based on false expectations of the outputs.

Thus, the initial assessment does not align with the function's actual behavior when given the definitions in the problem description.

Final: **True**
