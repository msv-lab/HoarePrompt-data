Based on the annotated version of the program and the original assessment provided, I will evaluate the correctness of the program according to the problem description.

The problem description states that the function should sort each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The `func_1` function is implemented to apply the `sorted()` function to each sublist, which is the correct approach for sorting strings in lexicographic order.

However, upon reviewing the function and the example outputs provided in the assertions:

1. The first assertion is misleading because it states the expected output should be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which is not a result of sorting any of the individual sublists. The correct expected outcome should reflect the sorted result of the sublists independently.
  
2. The second assertion demonstrates a potential issue with leading/trailing spaces. While the function does retain these spaces, it may cause confusion about the functional requirements regarding whitespace handling and whether the function should strip whitespace. This aspect is not covered in the assessment correctly.

3. The final assertion behaves correctly by providing expected sorted outputs.

The original assessment is accurate in stating that the main functionality of the program is to sort strings; however, it fails to address the misleading expectations of the first two assertions and does not consider that whitespace handling could lead to unexpected results.

Given that discrepancies exist between the expected outputs in the assertions and the actual outcomes of the sorting operation, as well as the issue of not handling leading/trailing whitespace appropriately being a potential concern depending on edge cases not included in the provided assertions, the initial assessment's conclusion about comprehensive correctness is not accurate.

Therefore, my final assessment is:

Final: **False**
