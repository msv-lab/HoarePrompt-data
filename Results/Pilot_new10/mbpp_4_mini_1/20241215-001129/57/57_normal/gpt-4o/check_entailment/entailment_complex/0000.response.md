Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. While the function `func_1` does sort each sublist of strings, there are some issues that arise:

1. **Input Handling**: The function does not perform any checks on the structure of the input. If the provided input is not a list of lists, or if any sublist contains non-string elements, the program will encounter runtime errors. This behavior is not aligned with the problem description, which implies that the function should properly handle various types of input, including erroneous cases.

2. **Output Details**: In the provided assertions, there are inconsistencies in the results. For example:
    - The first assertion states that the output of `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange']]` should be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which is incorrect. The correct sorted output for the last sublist should be `['black', 'orange', 'white']`, implying the function is designed to sort correctly, but the assertion reflects an error in expected output.

Given these points, the existing implementation cannot be guaranteed to work correctly under all circumstances as required by the problem description. Thus, the conclusion is that the program does not meet the specifications outlined in the problem description, leading to the final result of False.
