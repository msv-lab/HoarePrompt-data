The original assessment highlights that the function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings using the built-in `sorted()` function. However, it also raises concerns about the output of the first assertion as well as the handling of leading/trailing spaces in the second assertion, along with the coverage of potential edge cases, such as empty sublists.

Upon reviewing the provided hints and the original assessment:

1. The first assertion's expected output appears to not match the actual output of `func_1`, which indicates that there is an inconsistency with what is being asserted versus the output of the function. The expected output incorrectly lists `['black', 'orange', 'white']`, which is not the correct sorted list of `['white', 'black', 'orange']`.

2. The second assertion indicates that the function retains leading/trailing spaces, which may be acceptable depending on the problem description, yet it's unclear if the function is supposed to handle these spaces. If it were to sort with respect to these spaces leading to uneven sorting results, it'd indicate a limitation.

3. The absence of tests for edge cases like empty sublists further suggests that the program does not completely fulfill the expectations outlined in the problem description.

Given these observations and the output hints, which state that the function does not handle cases where the input is not structured as expected, it's evident that the function may not be robust across all scenarios implied by the problem description.

Thus, I believe that due to the discrepancy in the first assertion, the handling of spaces, and lack of edge case coverage, the original assessment did not accurately capture the problems within the function.

Final: **False**
