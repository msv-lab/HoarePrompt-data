Functionality: ** The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains strings. It returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner. There are no checks for empty sublists or handling of non-string elements, so it assumes all elements can be compared and sorted correctly. **
