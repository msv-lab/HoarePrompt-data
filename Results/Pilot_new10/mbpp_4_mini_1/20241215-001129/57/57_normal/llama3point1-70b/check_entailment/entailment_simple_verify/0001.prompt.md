You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists according to the problem description. It uses the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` to perform a case-insensitive sort, ensuring that strings are ordered correctly regardless of their case. 

Here's the reasoning for the correctness:
1. Each sublist is processed independently, which meets the requirement to sort each sublist of strings.
2. It considers all possible cases for sorting (e.g., "apple", "Apple", "banana") and will produce the expected sorted output in a case-insensitive manner.
3. Edge cases, such as empty sublists or sublists with mixed case strings, are handled correctly by the `sorted` function, as it does not raise errors or produce unexpected output.

Therefore, since there are no identified edge cases or instances where the program would fail to meet the requirements, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
