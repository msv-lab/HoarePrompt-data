Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of lists, where each sublist is expected to contain strings. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist and applies the `sorted()` function with `key=str.lower` to sort the strings in a case-insensitive manner.

Key points justifying correctness:

1. **Input Structure**: The function correctly accepts a list of lists (`list_of_lists`), which is consistent with the problem requirements.
   
2. **Sorting Mechanism**: It sorts each sublist using `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)`, which ensures the sorting is done in a case-insensitive way, thus providing appropriate sorting for strings regardless of their casing.

3. **Output Structure**: The function returns a new list that contains the sorted sublists, maintaining the structure of a list of lists.

4. **Assumption Handling**: While the code does not handle empty sublists or non-string elements, it is implicitly understood from the problem description that the input will consist of strings. Thus, within the scope of the provided problem description, it fulfills the requirements.

The program handles all potential cases stated in the problem description effectively, producing the expected output. Therefore, the function behaves as required.
