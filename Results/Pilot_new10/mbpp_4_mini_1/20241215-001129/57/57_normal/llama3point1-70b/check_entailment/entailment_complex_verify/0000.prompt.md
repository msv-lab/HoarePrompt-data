You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**. 

The provided program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, using `sorted()` with a case-insensitive sort due to the `key=str.lower` argument. This approach handles various potential cases correctly, such as sublists containing mixed-case strings, empty sublists, and lists with one string. For example:

- For an input like `[["banana", "Apple"], ["orange", "apple"]]`, the output will be `[['Apple', 'banana'], ['apple', 'orange']]`, which is the expected sorted output.
- An input like `[["Hello", "world"], []]` will return `[['Hello', 'world'], []]`, confirming that empty sublists are preserved and the sorting is correctly applied.

All edge cases regarding input strings and list structures seem to be handled adequately, confirming the correctness of the implementation.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains strings. It returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner. There are no checks for empty sublists or handling of non-string elements, so it assumes all elements can be compared and sorted correctly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
