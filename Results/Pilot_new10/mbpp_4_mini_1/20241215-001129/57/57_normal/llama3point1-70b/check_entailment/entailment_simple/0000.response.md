Correctness: **True**

The program satisfies the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter, `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists containing strings. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The program uses Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort each sublist. It also applies `key=str.lower` to perform case-insensitive sorting of the strings within the sublists. This approach ensures that the sorting is done accurately, irrespective of the case of the strings.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new list created via a list comprehension. Each element of this new list is the sorted version of the corresponding sublist in the original `list_of_lists`, which adheres to the requirement of the problem description.

4. **Case Coverage**: Given that `sorted()` with `key=str.lower` is capable of handling any combination of uppercase and lowercase strings, it covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.

Thus, because the program correctly implements the task of sorting each sublist of strings in a list of lists in a case-insensitive manner, it fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description.
