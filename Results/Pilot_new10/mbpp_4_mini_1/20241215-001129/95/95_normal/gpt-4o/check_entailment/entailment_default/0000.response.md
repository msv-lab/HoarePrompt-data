Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s: str) -> int:` uses the built-in string method `count` to return the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the input string `s`. However, it does not handle overlapping occurrences of 'std'. For example, in the string 'stdstd', the substring 'std' appears twice, but the `count` method would return 1. Since the problem description requires counting all occurrences, including overlapping ones, the implementation does not satisfy the requirement. 

Thus, the function fails in cases like 'stdstd' and will lead to incorrect results, which contradicts the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
