Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where the substring occurs multiple times in the main string. For example, if the input is `string = "abcabc"` and `substring = "abc"`, the function will only return the first occurrence, which may not fulfill the requirement of finding all occurrences and their positions. Additionally, the program assumes only one match will be found, contrary to what the problem description suggests with the phrase "find the occurrence and position". Hence, it is incomplete in its implementation based on the given description.
