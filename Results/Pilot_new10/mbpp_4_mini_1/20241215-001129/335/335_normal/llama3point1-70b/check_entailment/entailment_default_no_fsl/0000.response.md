Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. While it correctly identifies the first occurrence of a substring and provides its starting and ending indices, it fails to handle a significant scenario: when the substring appears multiple times in the string. According to the problem description, the function should find all occurrences and positions of the substrings, not just the first one.

For example, if we have the input string "hello hello" and the substring "hello", the function would only return the position of the first occurrence (0, 4) instead of reporting the second occurrence (6, 10). Therefore, because the code does not comply with the requirements for all cases, it is deemed incorrect.
