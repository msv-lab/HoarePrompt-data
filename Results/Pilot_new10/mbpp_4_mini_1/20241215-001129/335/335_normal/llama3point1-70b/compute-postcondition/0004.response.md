`end` is assigned the value of `start` plus the length of `substring`. Given that `substring` is a non-empty string that is shorter than or equal to `string`, `len(substring)` is a positive integer. The value of `end` will be calculated as `start + len(substring)`, resulting in `end` being greater than `start`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string that is shorter than or equal to `string`, `start` is a non-negative integer, and `end` is equal to `start + len(substring)`**.
