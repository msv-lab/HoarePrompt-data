`start_pos` is assigned the value of the first occurrence index of `sub_string` within `main_string`. The value of `start_pos` can be any non-negative integer if `sub_string` is found in `main_string`, or `-1` if it is not found. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a non-empty string, and `start_pos` is either a non-negative integer or -1 depending on the presence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. 

Output State: **`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a non-empty string, `start_pos` is either a non-negative integer or -1 depending on whether `sub_string` is found in `main_string`.**
