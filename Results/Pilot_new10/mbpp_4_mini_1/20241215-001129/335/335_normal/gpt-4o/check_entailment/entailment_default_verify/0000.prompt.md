You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program is supposed to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string according to the problem description. However, it fails in handling multiple occurrences of the substring in the main string. 

For example, if we test the string `'python programming, python language'` for the substring `'python'`, it is expected to return the position of the first occurrence of `'python'`, which the code does correctly. However, since the substring appears twice, the program does not address that.

To illustrate the failing case:
```python
assert func_1('python python python', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)  # should return the first occurrence
assert func_1('python python python', 'python') == ('python', 7, 13)  # second occurrence, this case is not handled
```
The positions of multiple occurrences were not considered in the initial implementation, thus resulting in incorrect behavior when more than one occurrence exists. 

Additionally, the assertion `assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None` is fine; it checks for a substring not present in the main string, which is handled correctly. 

Due to the lack of support for multiple occurrences of the substring and the potential for misunderstanding regarding the expected output format, the overall implementation does not fully meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness is deemed false.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a string `main_string` and a non-empty string `sub_string`. It returns `None` if `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, it returns `sub_string`, along with the start and end positions of `sub_string` within `main_string`. The end position is calculated as the start position plus the length of `sub_string`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
