Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not account for cases where the `sub_string` occurs multiple times within the `main_string`. According to the problem description, the program should find the occurrence and position of the substrings, implying that it should ideally be able to locate all instances of `sub_string` if they exist. The current implementation only finds the first occurrence of `sub_string`.

For example, given `main_string = 'python programming, python language'` and `sub_string = 'python'`, the expected behavior would potentially include handling the second occurrence as well. However, the code will only return the first occurrence, which does not align with the interpretation that one might have from the problem description.

Thus, it is missing the capability to return all occurrences and positions of the substring or at least clarify that it only returns the first match, leading to it being classified as incorrect based on the problem requirements.
