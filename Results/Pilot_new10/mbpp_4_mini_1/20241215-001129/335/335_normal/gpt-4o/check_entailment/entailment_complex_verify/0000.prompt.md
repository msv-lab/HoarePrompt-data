You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program is supposed to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string according to the problem description. However, it fails in handling multiple occurrences of the substring in the main string. 

For example, if we test the string `'python programming, python language'` for the substring `'python'`, it is expected to return the position of the first occurrence of `'python'`, which the code does correctly. However, since the substring appears twice, the program does not address that.

To illustrate the failing case:
```python
assert func_1('python python python', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)  # should return the first occurrence
assert func_1('python python python', 'python') == ('python', 7, 13)  # second occurrence, this case is not handled
```
The positions of multiple occurrences were not considered in the initial implementation, thus resulting in incorrect behavior when more than one occurrence exists. 

Additionally, the assertion `assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None` is fine; it checks for a substring not present in the main string, which is handled correctly. 

Due to the lack of support for multiple occurrences of the substring and the potential for misunderstanding regarding the expected output format, the overall implementation does not fully meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness is deemed false.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_string is a string and sub_string is a non-empty string.
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if (start_pos == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that no specific value or variable has been found.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a non-empty string, and `start_pos` is a non-negative integer indicating the position where `sub_string` is found in `main_string` (not -1).
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return sub_string, start_pos, end_pos
    #The program returns sub_string which is a non-empty string, start_pos which is a non-negative integer, and end_pos which is equal to start_pos + len(sub_string)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `main_string` and a non-empty string `sub_string`. It returns `None` if `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, it returns `sub_string`, along with the start and end positions of `sub_string` within `main_string`. The end position is calculated as the start position plus the length of `sub_string`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
