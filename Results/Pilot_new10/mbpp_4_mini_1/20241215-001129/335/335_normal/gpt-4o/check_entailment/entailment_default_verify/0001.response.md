The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not account for multiple occurrences of the substring in the main string. However, the problem description does not specify that the function must return all occurrences; it only requires finding and reporting the occurrence and position of the substring. The original assessment assumes additional functionality that is not explicitly stated in the problem description.

The output hints clarify that the function is designed to return the first occurrence of the substring along with the start and end positions or `None` if the substring is not found. Given that the problem description is met by the implementation, the original assessment is not accurate.

Therefore, I conclude that the function serves its intended purpose according to the problem description and does not need to account for multiple occurrences based on what is specified.

Final: **True**
