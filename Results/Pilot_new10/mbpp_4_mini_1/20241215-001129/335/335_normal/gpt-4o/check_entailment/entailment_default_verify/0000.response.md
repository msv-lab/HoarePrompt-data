The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not handle multiple occurrences of the substring within the string. The problem description explicitly states the need to find the occurrence and position of substrings, which implies a handling mechanism for multiple occurrences. While the current implementation correctly returns the first occurrence, it fails to account for any subsequent occurrences of the substring, which means it does not fully satisfy the problem requirements.

Furthermore, the output hints clarify that the function is designed to return details about the first occurrence only, not all occurrences. Thus, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is justified because the implementation does not match the broader interpretation of "occurrences" within the string, especially when dealing with strings that contain multiple instances of the substring.

Based on this analysis, the original assessment remains accurate.

Final: **False**
