Final: **False**

The original assessment indicates that the program is incorrect due to its failure to account for multiple occurrences of the substring in the main string. However, the problem description does not explicitly request the handling of multiple occurrences. The program behaves correctly according to the requirement of finding the first occurrence of the substring and returning the appropriate start and end positions, or returning None if there is no match.

The provided assertions also correctly test the expected outputs for the given inputs, confirming that the program functions as intended under the constraints described in the problem statement. The annotated version reflects these operations accurately, and nothing in the problem description suggests that the function needs to find all occurrences or return all positions. Therefore, the original assessment's reasoning about the program's failure is not justified based on the problem at hand. 

Thus, I conclude that the program is actually correct regarding the problem description provided.
