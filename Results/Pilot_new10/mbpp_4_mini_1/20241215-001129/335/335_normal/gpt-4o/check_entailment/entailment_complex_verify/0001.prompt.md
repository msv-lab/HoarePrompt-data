You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the substring appears multiple times in the main string. According to the problem description, it is expected to find and return the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string, which implies that if a substring is found multiple times, there should be a mechanism to capture and report the latest or all occurrences. 

For example, if we call `func_1('python programming, python programming', 'python')`, the correct output should ideally account for all occurrences, but the current function only finds and returns the first occurrence. Hence, it won't meet the specified requirements of the problem description. 

Thus, the function is incomplete in addressing all potential cases, confirming it as incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_string is a string and sub_string is a non-empty string.
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if (start_pos == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that no specific value or variable has been found.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a non-empty string, and `start_pos` is a non-negative integer indicating the position where `sub_string` is found in `main_string` (not -1).
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return sub_string, start_pos, end_pos
    #The program returns sub_string which is a non-empty string, start_pos which is a non-negative integer, and end_pos which is equal to start_pos + len(sub_string)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `main_string` and a non-empty string `sub_string`. It returns `None` if `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, it returns `sub_string`, along with the start and end positions of `sub_string` within `main_string`. The end position is calculated as the start position plus the length of `sub_string`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
