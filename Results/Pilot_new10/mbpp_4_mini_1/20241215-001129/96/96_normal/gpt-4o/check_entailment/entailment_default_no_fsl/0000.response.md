Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the first element of the tuple is a boolean. In Python, booleans are subclasses of integers, so when the tuple contains integers and a boolean, the expected behavior of checking for the same data type is violated. For example, if we have a tuple like `(1, 2, True)`, the function would return `True`, indicating that all elements are of the same type, but logically they are not since `True` is a boolean and should be treated differently from integers. This discrepancy highlights that the function does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.
