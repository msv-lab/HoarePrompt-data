The original assessment correctly identified that the implementation of the function does not satisfy the requirement of summing only non-repeated elements in the list. The use of `set(lst)` creates a set of unique values, but it includes values that are repeated in the original list, thus missing the requirement to sum only those elements that are non-repeated. 

For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the number `1` appears multiple times and should not contribute to the final sum. However, the function as implemented would include it as part of the unique set, which is incorrect based on the problem description.

The annotated version of the code confirms that it indeed sums all unique integers, thus treating duplicates as valid contributing elements, leading to incorrect results.

Given this information, the original assessment remains accurate:

Final: **False**.
