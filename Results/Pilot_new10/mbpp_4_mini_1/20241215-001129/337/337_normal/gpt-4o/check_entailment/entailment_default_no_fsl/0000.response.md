Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to find the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in a given list. However, the approach used in the function `func_1` simply computes the sum of all unique integers using the `set` data structure. This implementation does not correctly account for the fact that "non-repeated" elements should refer specifically to those numbers that appear exactly once in the input list.

For example, consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The unique elements using a set are `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`, which sums to `21`. While this matches the expected output in the assertions, other cases show incorrect behavior. 

To illustrate:

- In the list `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]`, the correct non-repeated (unique) elements should be `1, 9, 2, 45`, which sum to `56`, not `71` as implied by the assertion.
- For the list `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]`, the non-repeated elements are `12, 9, 2`, which sum to `23`, not `78`.

Therefore, the program does not successfully meet the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements as specified in the problem description.

Given this discrepancy, the implementation does not handle the requirement correctly for all cases. Thus, the result is determined to be incorrect.
