Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program is indeed incorrect according to the problem description. The task is to sum only non-repeated elements from the list, but the implementation uses `set(lst)` which removes all duplicates, leading to the inclusion of repeated elements in the sum. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the correct behavior should yield a sum of `20` (considering only `2, 3, 4, 5, 6`), but the program incorrectly outputs `21` since it sums all the unique values including those that are repeated. The annotations confirm that the program does not adequately address the requirement of summing only non-repeated elements, thereby supporting the original assessment of the program's correctness as **False**.
