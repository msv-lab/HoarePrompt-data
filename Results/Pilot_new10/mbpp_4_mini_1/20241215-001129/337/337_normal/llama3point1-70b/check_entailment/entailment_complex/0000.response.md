Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The program is designed to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list of integers. This aligns perfectly with the problem statement which requests the same.

2. **Logic of the Function**: The function employs a generator expression that iterates over each element `i` in the list `lst`. It checks the condition `lst.count(i) == 1`, which means it only considers those elements that appear exactly once in the list. Therefore, if an element appears more than once, it is excluded from the sum.

3. **Return Value**: The `sum()` function is applied to the generator expression, which sums up all the elements that meet the non-repetition criteria. If there are no unique elements (i.e., they all appear more than once or the list is empty), the function will return `0`, as the sum of an empty sequence is zero.

4. **Consistency with Edge Cases**: The function handles all edge cases specified in the problem description:
   - If the list is empty, the result is `0`, as there are no elements to consider.
   - If all integers are repeated, the function also returns `0`, which is correct as there are no non-repeated elements to sum.

Since the function implements the requirements as described and handles all potential edge cases appropriately, it is confirmed to be correct.
