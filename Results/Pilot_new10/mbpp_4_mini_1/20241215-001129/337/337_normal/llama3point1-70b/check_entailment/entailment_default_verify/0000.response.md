Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(lst)` successfully computes the sum of non-repeated elements in the list as required by the problem description. It correctly handles various scenarios, including empty lists and lists where all elements are duplicates, returning 0 in these cases when appropriate. The output hints support this assessment, confirming that the function behaves as expected and provides the correct results based on the defined criteria. Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
