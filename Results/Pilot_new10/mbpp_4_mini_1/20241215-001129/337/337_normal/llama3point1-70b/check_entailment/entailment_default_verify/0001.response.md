Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the output hints. The program functions correctly by summing non-repeated elements in the provided list. It handles all edge cases adequately, including returning `0` for an empty list and lists with no unique elements, while correctly summing non-repeated integers when they exist. The performance concern does not affect the correctness of the program under the assumption of valid input, confirming that the assessment of **True** was indeed appropriate.
