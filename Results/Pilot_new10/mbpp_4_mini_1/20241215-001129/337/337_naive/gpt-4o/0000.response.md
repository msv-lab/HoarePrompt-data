Correctness: **False**.

The provided implementation does not properly handle the requirement of summing only non-repeated elements. By using `set(lst)`, the program removes all duplicates from the list, and then sums the remaining values. However, it fails to ensure that the elements being summed are truly non-repeated.

For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The unique elements, after converting to a set, are `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`. The program would return the sum `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`. However, the element `1` is repeated, and thus it should not be included in the sum according to the problem description. The correct sum for this list, considering only non-repeated elements, should be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirement to sum only non-repeated elements.
