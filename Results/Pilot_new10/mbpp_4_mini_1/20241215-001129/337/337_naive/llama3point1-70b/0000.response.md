Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly computes the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list. It iterates through each element in `lst` and uses `lst.count(i)` to check if the element `i` appears exactly once in the list. If it does, it includes it in the sum. 

The logic handles:
- Empty lists, returning 0.
- Lists where all elements are duplicates, returning 0.
- Lists with varied elements, correctly summing only the unique elements.

Since I can't find any input case where the function fails to meet the requirement specified in the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
