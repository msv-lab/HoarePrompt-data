According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in `nested_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 element, which means the loop has executed for at least one item in that list. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `nested_list` must be accessed.

Since `i` is the current element from `nested_list`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to look at the next element in `nested_list`. Given that `nested_list` contains at least 1 element, it is assumed that we can iterate over the elements exactly as many times as there are elements in the list.

If the loop has not yet exhausted all elements, we can define the state as follows:
- If `nested_list` has more than 1 element, we can assume there will be at least one more iteration.
- If we have already processed one element, `i` will move to the next element in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 2 elements; i is the next element in the list.**
