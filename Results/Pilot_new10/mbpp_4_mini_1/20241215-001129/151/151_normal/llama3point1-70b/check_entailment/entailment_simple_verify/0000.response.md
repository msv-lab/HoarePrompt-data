Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotations. The function `func_1` correctly implements a recursive approach to flattening a nested list structure. The annotations clarify the state of the program at various points, confirming that the function processes the input as expected and returns the correct flattened list. It successfully handles various cases, such as nested lists to any depth and empty lists. 

Overall, both the annotated code and the assessment align with the problem requirements, affirming the correctness of the program.
