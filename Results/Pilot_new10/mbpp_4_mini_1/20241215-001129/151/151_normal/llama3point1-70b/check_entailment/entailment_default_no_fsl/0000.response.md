Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function that flattens a nested list structure. It does this through recursion, effectively handling lists at any depth by checking each element. If the element is a list, it recursively calls itself to extend the flat output list with the results from that call. If the element is not a list (and thus is an integer), it appends the integer to the flat list.

The function also satisfies the output hints; it returns an empty list if the input `nested_list` is empty or contains no integers. The program correctly processes various cases, including deeply nested lists, mixed types, and empty inputs.

Since there are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs where the function fails, we conclude that the implementation is correct for all specified use cases.
