Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` successfully implements a recursive algorithm to flatten a nested list structure. It correctly identifies elements within the provided `nested_list`, and for any element that is itself a list, it recursively flattens it. This behavior matches the problem description, which requires the function to handle nested lists of varying depths and return a single flattened list. 

The output hints confirm that the function is designed to return an empty list when the input is empty and correctly flattens lists containing integers and other lists. Since the code handles all specified cases, including those mentioned in the output hints, the assessment of correctness as **True** is validated.
