You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a recursive approach to flatten a nested list structure. 

### Explanation:
1. The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input.
2. It initializes an empty list `flat_list` to hold the flattened elements.
3. It iterates over each element `i` in the `nested_list`.
   - If the element `i` is itself a list, the function calls itself recursively (`func_1(i)`) to flatten that sub-list and extends `flat_list` with the resulting elements.
   - If the element `i` is not a list, it gets appended directly to `flat_list`.
4. Finally, the function returns the flattened list.

The program correctly handles all types of nested lists, including:
- An empty list: `func_1([])` results in `[]`.
- Flat lists: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` results in `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Nested lists of various depths: `func_1([1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6])` results in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

Additionally, it handles edge cases like:
- Mixed data types, such as `func_1([1, 'a', [2.5, [True, [None]]]])` which results in `[1, 'a', 2.5, True, None]`.

Since the function correctly flattens any form of nested list without missing any scenarios, the program is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list `nested_list`, which can contain integers and/or other lists (nested to any depth). It recursively flattens `nested_list` into a single list containing all integers from the original list and any nested lists within it. If `nested_list` is empty or contains no integers, the function returns an empty list. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
