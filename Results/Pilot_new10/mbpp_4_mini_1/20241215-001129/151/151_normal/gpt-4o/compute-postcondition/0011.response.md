According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least one more item, the loop executes again for the next item in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` is a non-empty list with at least one more item. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `nested_list` must have at least one more item beyond the current `item`, and `item` should refer to the next item in the list. 

State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list with at least one more item, item is the next item in the list**
