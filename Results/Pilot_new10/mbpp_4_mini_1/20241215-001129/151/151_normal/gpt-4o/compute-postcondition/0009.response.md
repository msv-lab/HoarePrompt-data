`flat_list` is updated to include `item`, which is the next item in `nested_list`. The `nested_list` remains a non-empty list with at least 1 more item, meaning the other contents of `nested_list` and any previous items in `flat_list` are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a non-empty list with at least 1 more item, and `flat_list` now includes the `item`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list with at least 1 more item, `flat_list` includes `item`**.
