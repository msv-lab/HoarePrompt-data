The code attempts to apply `func_1` to the `item`, which represents the next item in `nested_list`. It then extends `flat_list` with the result of that function call. Given that `nested_list` is non-empty and contains at least one more item, `item` would have a valid value. The exact behavior and output of `func_1(item)` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but the state of `flat_list` will be modified to include whatever `func_1(item)` returns.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list with at least one more item, `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(item)`**
