Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `nested_list` that can contain non-list elements and lists nested at any level. It returns a flattened version of `nested_list`, containing all non-list elements while preserving their order. If `nested_list` is empty, the returned `flat_list` is also empty. The function correctly handles any level of nesting and does not impose any restrictions on the types of non-list elements in the input list.**
