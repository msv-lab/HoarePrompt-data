#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain other lists or non-list elements, and it can be nested at any level.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list`, containing all non-list elements and the elements from any lists contained within `nested_list`, preserving their order. If `nested_list` is empty, then `flat_list` remains empty.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns `flat_list`, which is a flattened version of `nested_list`, containing all non-list elements and the elements from any lists contained within `nested_list`, preserving their order. If `nested_list` is empty, then `flat_list` remains empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `nested_list` that can contain non-list elements and lists nested at any level. It returns a flattened version of `nested_list`, containing all non-list elements while preserving their order. If `nested_list` is empty, the returned `flat_list` is also empty. The function correctly handles any level of nesting and does not impose any restrictions on the types of non-list elements in the input list.
