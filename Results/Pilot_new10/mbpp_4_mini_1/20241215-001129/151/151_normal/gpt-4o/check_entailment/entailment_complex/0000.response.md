Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it successfully fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description to flatten nested lists.

### Explanation of Correctness:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a single parameter, `nested_list`, which is expected to be a list that can contain both non-list elements and other lists, potentially nested at multiple levels.

2. **Recursive Flattening**: The function uses recursion to iterate through each item in `nested_list`. 
   - If an item is a list (`isinstance(item, list)`), the function calls itself (`func_1(item)`) to further flatten that submenu and extends `flat_list` with the result.
   - If the item is not a list, it simply appends the item to `flat_list`.

3. **Preservation of Order**: The implementation ensures that the order of elements is preserved by using `flat_list.extend()` for lists and `flat_list.append()` for individual elements.

4. **Handling Empty Lists**: If `nested_list` is empty, the function correctly returns an empty list (`flat_list`), which is the expected behavior.

5. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions demonstrate that the function has been tested against various inputs, including complex nested lists. In all cases, the outputs match the expected flattened lists, verifying that the function works correctly for the defined use cases.

Since the function handles all specified scenarios (nested lists of any depth, maintaining order, and handling of empty lists) effectively and produces the correct output as described in the problem statement, the program is indeed correct.
