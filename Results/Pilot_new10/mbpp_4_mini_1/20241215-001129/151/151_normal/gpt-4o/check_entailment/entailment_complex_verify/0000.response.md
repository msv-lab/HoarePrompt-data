Final: **True**

The original assessment states that the program is correct, and upon reviewing both the problem description and the annotated version of the code, this assessment is accurate. The `func_1` function effectively flattens any nested list structure by utilizing recursion. It correctly checks if each element is a list and, if so, recursively processes it. Based on the annotations, the function guarantees that `flat_list` will be a flattened version of `nested_list`, preserving the order of all non-list elements. 

The assertions provided in the program also confirm that the function performs as expected for various input scenarios, validating the implementation against the requirements. The annotations further confirm that even edge cases, such as empty lists, are handled appropriately. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
