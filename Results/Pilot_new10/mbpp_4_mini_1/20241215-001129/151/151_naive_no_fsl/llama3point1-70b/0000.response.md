Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a recursive approach to flatten a nested list structure. 

### Explanation:
1. The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input.
2. It initializes an empty list `flat_list` to hold the flattened elements.
3. It iterates over each element `i` in the `nested_list`.
   - If the element `i` is itself a list, the function calls itself recursively (`func_1(i)`) to flatten that sub-list and extends `flat_list` with the resulting elements.
   - If the element `i` is not a list, it gets appended directly to `flat_list`.
4. Finally, the function returns the flattened list.

The program correctly handles all types of nested lists, including:
- An empty list: `func_1([])` results in `[]`.
- Flat lists: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` results in `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Nested lists of various depths: `func_1([1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6])` results in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

Additionally, it handles edge cases like:
- Mixed data types, such as `func_1([1, 'a', [2.5, [True, [None]]]])` which results in `[1, 'a', 2.5, True, None]`.

Since the function correctly flattens any form of nested list without missing any scenarios, the program is deemed correct.
