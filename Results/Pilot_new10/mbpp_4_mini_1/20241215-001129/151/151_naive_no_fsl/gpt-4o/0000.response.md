Correctness: **True**

The provided program implements a function `func_1` that flattens a nested list structure. The function recursively explores each item in the input list. If the item is a list, it calls itself recursively to flatten that sublist; if the item is not a list, it appends the item to the flat list. 

The assertions provided in the program check various cases of nested lists, and they all return the expected flattened results. 

I could not find an example where the function does not work as expected. It correctly handles multiple levels of nesting, empty lists, and combinations of lists and non-list items. Thus, the implementation fulfills the requirements as described in the problem statement.

Since there are no potential cases where it does not work as stated, I conclude that the program is correct.
