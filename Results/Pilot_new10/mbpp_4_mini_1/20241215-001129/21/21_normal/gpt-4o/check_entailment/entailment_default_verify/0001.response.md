Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but upon reviewing the output hints, it becomes clear that the function does not appropriately handle the edge case of an empty list. While it is true that the problem description assumes valid input, the potential occurrence of an empty list (which would raise a `ValueError` with the `min()` function) is an important consideration for program correctness. Given that the function could fail under this scenario, the original assessment of correctness is inaccurate.
