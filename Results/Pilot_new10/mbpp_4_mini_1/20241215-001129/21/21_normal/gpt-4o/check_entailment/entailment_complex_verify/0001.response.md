Final: **False**

The original assessment states that the program is correct, but the annotated version of the code reveals that the `func_1` function does not handle the edge case of an empty list. While the problem description implies that the input will be valid, it does not explicitly state that the list will never be empty. Since the function will raise a `ValueError` if an empty list is passed, this constitutes a failure in meeting the requirements for all potential inputs. Hence, the assessment of correctness is not accurate.
