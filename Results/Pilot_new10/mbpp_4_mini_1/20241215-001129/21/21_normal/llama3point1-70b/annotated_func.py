#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of numbers.
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list of numbers 'nums'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers `nums` and returns the minimum value from that list. If `nums` is empty, a ValueError will be raised due to the use of the `min` function.
