Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description because while it correctly returns the smallest number in a list, it does not handle the case where the input list `nums` is empty. When `nums` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the use of the `min` function, which is not an acceptable outcome based on the problem description. The description does not specify how to handle an empty list, but ideally, it should return some indication (like `None` or a specific message) rather than raising an error. Thus, the function is not robust for all potential inputs as required by the problem description.
