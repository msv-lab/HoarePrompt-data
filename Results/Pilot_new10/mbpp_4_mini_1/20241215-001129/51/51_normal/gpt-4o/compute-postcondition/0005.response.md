According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list of `numbers`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third number in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a non-empty list that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second number in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements and `num` should be the third number in the list. 

State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of numbers that must have at least 3 elements, `product` is the value of `num^2`, `num` is the third number in the list.**
