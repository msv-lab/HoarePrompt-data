The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a non-empty list of numbers, which can be either integers or floats. After executing the function body, it calculates the product of all the numbers in the list `numbers` and then divides this product by the length of the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty list of numbers and return the product of those numbers divided by the count of how many numbers are in the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers, which is a non-empty list of numbers, and returns the product of all numbers in the list divided by the length of the list.**
