Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not handle a critical edge case: when the input list contains zeros. If there is a zero in the input list, the product of all numbers will be zero, and the function will return zero regardless of the length of the list (which is valid). However, the division should not yield zero just because there was a zero in the list, as this doesn't align with the multiplication and division concept intended in the problem description. 

For example:
- If the input is `(0, 1, 2)`, the product is `0`, and the length is `3`, so the return value would be `0 / 3 = 0`. This result could be misleading, as this implies that the overall influence of the numbers loses significance when a zero is multiplied with others.

Moreover, it is also important to ensure the input is not empty, but since the problem statement mentions "non-empty list", the program does implicitly handle that well. 

However, since the result can vary significantly with the presence of zeros, the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem in every potential case. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
