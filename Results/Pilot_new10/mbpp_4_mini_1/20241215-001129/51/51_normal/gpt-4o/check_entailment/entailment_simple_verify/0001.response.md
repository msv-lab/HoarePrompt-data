Final: **True**

The original assessment noted the potential issue with an empty list but ultimately concluded that the function meets the problem requirements, which is correct given the annotation indicating that the function is assumed to work with valid (non-empty) inputs. Since the annotated version clarifies that the function is expected to handle valid, non-empty inputs, and it correctly multiplies the numbers and divides by the length of the list, the function is indeed correct as per the problem description. Therefore, I believe the original assessment was accurate in concluding the program's correctness based on the assumption of valid inputs.
