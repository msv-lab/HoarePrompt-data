You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((-10, -20, -30)), -2000.0, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((19, 15, 18)), 1710.0, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it meets the requirements of multiplying all the numbers in a list and then dividing by the length of that list.

The function `func_1` performs the following steps:
1. It initializes a variable `product` to 1.
2. It iterates through each number in the input list `numbers` and multiplies each number to the `product`.
3. Finally, it divides the `product` by the length of the list and returns the result.

Now, let's consider the potential edge cases that might affect the correctness of this implementation:

### Edge Cases
1. **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, calling `len(numbers)` would return 0, leading to a division by zero error when calculating `result = product / len(numbers)`. This is a critical case that is not handled in the code.
2. **Single Element List**: For a list with a single element, the function should return that element itself, and since dividing by 1 is valid, this edge case appears to work correctly.
3. **Negative Numbers**: As demonstrated in the assertions, the function handles negative numbers correctly by multiplying them appropriately.
4. **Zero in the List**: If the list contains zero, the product would be zero, and dividing zero by the length of the list would result in zero, which is expected behavior.

Based on this analysis, while the function handles several cases correctly, it fails to handle an empty list gracefully.

Since there is at least one case (the empty list) that is not handled properly by the program leading to a runtime error, we conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert math.isclose(func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((-10, -20, -30)), -2000.0, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((19, 15, 18)), 1710.0, rel_tol=0.001)

import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats) and is non-empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is the product of all numbers in the list `numbers`, and `numbers` is a non-empty list of numbers.
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the result which is equal to the product of all numbers in the list 'numbers' divided by the length of 'numbers'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
