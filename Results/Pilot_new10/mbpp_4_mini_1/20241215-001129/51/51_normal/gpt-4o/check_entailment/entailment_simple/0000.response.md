To determine the correctness of the program with respect to the problem description, we need to analyze the provided function `func_1` and see if it correctly fulfills the requirement to multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide the product by the length of the list.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a list (or tuple, as shown in the assertions) of numbers as its input. It is assumed from the description that these numbers can either be integers or floats and that the input is non-empty.

2. **Multiplication of All Elements**: 
   - The program initializes a variable `product` to `1`.
   - It then iterates over each number in the input list, multiplying the `product` by each number.
   - At the end of this loop, `product` contains the total product of all numbers in the list.

3. **Division by Length**: 
   - After calculating the product, the program divides this product by the length of the input list (`len(numbers)`).
   - The result of this division is returned.

4. **Assertions & Expected Behavior**: The assertions test the functionality of `func_1` against known outputs:
   - For the input `(8, 2, 3, -1, 7)`, it asserts that the result should be `-67.2`.
   - For the input `(-10, -20, -30)`, it expects `-2000.0`.
   - And for the input `(19, 15, 18)`, it expects `1710.0`.
   - These assertions suggest that the program correctly implements the required functionality, as it seems to yield the expected results.

### Validation Against Problem Description:

- **Correct Calculation**: The function multiplies all input numbers together, which fulfills the first part of the requirement.
- **Division by Length**: The second part of the requirement is fulfilled by dividing the total product by the length of the list, thereby providing the final result as specified.

### Conclusion:

Given that the function `func_1` performs the required operations in accordance with the problem description, it is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True** 

The program meets the problem description since it precisely multiplies all the numbers in the list and divides the result by the length of the list, thereby achieving the stated objectives accurately.
