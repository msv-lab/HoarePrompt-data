Initial State: `numbers` is a list of integers or floats, and the list is not empty; `product` is 1.

The loop multiplies each element in the `numbers` list with the current value of `product`. 

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `product` is equal to `num`, `num` is the first element in the `numbers` list.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `product` is equal to `num1 * num2`, `num` is the second element in the `numbers` list, `numbers` must have at least 2 elements.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `product` is equal to `num1 * num2 * num3`, `num` is the third element in the `numbers` list, `numbers` must have at least 3 elements.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `product` will be the product of all elements in the `numbers` list, and if `numbers` contains `k` elements, `product` will equal `num1 * num2 * ... * numk` where each `num` corresponds to the elements in the list. If the list is empty, the loop does not execute, and `product` remains 1.

Output State: **`product` is the product of all elements in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats.**
