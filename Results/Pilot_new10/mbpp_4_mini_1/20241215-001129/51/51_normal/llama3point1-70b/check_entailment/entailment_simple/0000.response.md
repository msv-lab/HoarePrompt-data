Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly returns the average of the numbers in the list instead of multiplying all the numbers and then dividing by the length of the list. According to the problem description, the function should return the product of all elements in the list divided by the length of the list. However, due to the way the return statement is structured, it calculates `product / len(numbers)` which is not the same as following the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

To clarify, while the program correctly computes the product of the elements in the list, the statement that it returns "the average of all elements" is incorrect, as dividing the product by the length does not yield the average of the elements in the list. Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem requirements.
