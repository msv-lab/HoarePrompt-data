Final: **False**

The original assessment was correct in identifying that the program does not handle the case of an empty list. Although the annotated version presumes the input will always be a non-empty list, the problem description does not specify that assumption. The program has the potential to encounter a `ZeroDivisionError` when an empty list is provided, which means it does not meet the requirements of the problem description as it stands. Therefore, the assessment that the program is not completely correct is valid.
