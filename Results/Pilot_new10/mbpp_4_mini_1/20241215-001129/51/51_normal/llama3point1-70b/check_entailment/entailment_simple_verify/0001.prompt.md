You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the code implementation.

**Problem Description:** 
The task is to write a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and then divides the result by the length of the list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Empty List Case:** 
   - If the input list `numbers` is empty (`[]`), the `len(numbers)` will return `0`. This will lead to a division by zero error when trying to execute `product / len(numbers)`, as dividing by zero is undefined in mathematics and will cause a runtime exception in Python.

2. **Normal Cases:** 
   - For a non-empty list, the program correctly multiplies all numbers together and divides that product by the length of the list.

3. **Negative Numbers and Zero:**
   - If the list includes zeros, the product will be `0`, and the result will be `0` (which is correct).
   - The program will also work with negative numbers, returning a negative value but mathematically accurate according to the description.

### Conclusion:
While the program works well for a variety of cases, the empty list case is a critical flaw where it does not handle the case as per the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not define what to do with an empty list, leading to a division by zero error.

Given this analysis, we can conclude:
Correctness: **False** 

The program fails when provided with an empty list, which is a fundamental case that needs to be handled.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers or floats, and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is the product of all elements in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average of all elements in 'numbers', calculated as product divided by the length of the list 'numbers'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
