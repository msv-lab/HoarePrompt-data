Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly filters odd integers from the provided list, which aligns with the problem description of writing a function to filter odd numbers. The annotated code confirms that the function behaves as expected: it returns a list of all odd integers from the input list and, in the case of an empty list, returns an empty list. The assertions provided also validate the correctness of the implementation with various inputs, all yielding the correct outputs. Since the program meets the requirements and operates correctly under the assumption of valid inputs, there is no indication of any errors or failure in functionality.
