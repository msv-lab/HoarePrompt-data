Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(nums)` is designed to filter and return only the odd integers from the input list `nums`, which aligns perfectly with the problem description that specifically requires a function to filter odd numbers. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over each number in `nums` and includes it in the resulting list only if it satisfies the condition that it is not evenly divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd).

The assertions provided serve as test cases that validate the implementation:
- The first assertion verifies that from a mixed list of numbers, only the odd numbers `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` are returned.
- The second assertion confirms that from another list, only the odd numbers `[45, 67, 93]` are included in the output.
- The third assertion checks that the function accurately handles a list with multiple odd numbers and includes them in the result: `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

Additionally, the comments in the code clearly describe the intended behavior of the function, stating that it returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the list `nums` and clarifies what happens in edge cases, such as when the input list is empty.

Thus, the function meets the requirements set forth in the problem description and operates as intended for the provided test cases and any other scenarios that involve integer input.
