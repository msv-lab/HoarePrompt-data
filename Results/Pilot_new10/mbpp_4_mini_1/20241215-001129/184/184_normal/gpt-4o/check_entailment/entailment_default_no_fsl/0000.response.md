Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly filters odd numbers from a list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that satisfy the condition `num % 2 != 0` (i.e., odd numbers). 

The output hints clarify that the function returns an empty list if the input is empty, correctly addressing that scenario as well. It is assumed from the problem description that the input consists of integers; therefore, cases involving non-integer elements or mixed types are not a concern based on the problem constraints as there are no such elements in the provided examples.

The assertions in the code correctly validate that the expected outputs for the provided test cases accurately represent the function's capabilities. Thus, since the program does meet the requirements in the problem description, it functions correctly for all specified scenarios.
