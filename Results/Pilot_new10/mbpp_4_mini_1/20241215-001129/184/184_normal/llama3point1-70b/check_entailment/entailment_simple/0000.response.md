Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it filters out odd numbers, but the requirement is to filter out the odd numbers and retain the even numbers instead. The list comprehension in the provided function returns all integers from the input list `nums` that are odd, which is the opposite of what the problem description specifies. 

For instance, if you call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4])`, the function will return `[1, 3]`, but the expected behavior based on the problem description would be to filter out odd numbers and thus return `[2, 4]`. Therefore, the program is incorrect with respect to the problem statement.
