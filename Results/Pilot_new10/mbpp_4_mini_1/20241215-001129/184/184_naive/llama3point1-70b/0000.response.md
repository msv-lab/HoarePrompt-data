Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to filter odd numbers, but it only filters out the odd numbers and returns them while ignoring the even numbers. However, it does not return anything when there are no odd numbers in the input, which could be misleading. 

For example, consider the input:
```python
func_1([2, 4, 6])
```
The expected output should ideally indicate that there are no odd numbers, which would typically be an empty list `[]`. However, the program does work correctly in this case because the list comprehension will simply return an empty list, which means the intended “filtering” might be interpreted as incorrect per the description unless specified otherwise. 

Another point to consider is that if the input list contains negative odd numbers, they are correctly included, which is expected behavior. But again, if the input list had mixed odd and even values, the program simply returns the odd numbers.

Since the program does not clarify how it handles other cases, such as inputs without any odd numbers (which it does correctly but might not specify in output expectations), the potential lack of clarity and edge cases makes the program incorrect for the given description. 

So, while the basic functionality might seem correct, it does not fully meet the expectations given the problem description regarding handling of all potential inputs adequately.

Thus, the conclusion is:
Correctness: **False**.
