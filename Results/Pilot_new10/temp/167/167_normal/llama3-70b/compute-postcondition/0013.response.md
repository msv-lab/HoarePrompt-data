To analyze the given code snippet, we will take a detailed look at how it affects the variable values in the initial state. The code provided is:

```
nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
```

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000
- `a` is a list of integers of length at least 3
- `v` is the third element in the list `a`
- `px` is equal to `nx`
- `py` is equal to `ny`
- `nx` is (v - 1) // y
- `ny` is (v - 1) % y

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. The computation `(v - 1) // y` calculates the integer division of `(v - 1)` by `y`, resulting in the variable `nx`.
2. The computation `(v - 1) % y` calculates the remainder of the division of `(v - 1)` by `y`, resulting in the variable `ny`.
3. Variables `px` and `py` are changed based on the new values of `nx` and `ny`.
4. Other variables such as `n` and `a` remain unchanged; only `nx`, `ny`, `px`, and `py` will be updated.

### Summary of Changes:
- `nx` is now `(v - 1) // y`
- `ny` is now `(v - 1) % y`
- `px` is assigned the new value of `nx`
- `py` is assigned the new value of `ny`

### Output State:
Therefore, the Output State encapsulates all the initial conditions while reflecting the changes made by executing the assigned code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of integers of length at least 3, `v` is the third element in the list `a`, `px` is now equal to (v - 1) // y, `py` is now equal to (v - 1) % y, `nx` is (v - 1) // y, `ny` is (v - 1) % y.**
