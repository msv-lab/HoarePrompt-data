The values of `px` and `py` are updated to be equal to `nx` and `ny`, respectively. The previous values of `px` and `py` do not change any conditions for the output. The other variables retain their previous states, and no further information is impacted by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `px` is equal to `nx`, `py` is equal to `ny`, `v` is the second element in the list `a`, `nx` is (v - 1) // y, `ny` is (v - 1) % y**
