The code `px, py = 0, 0` directly assigns the value `0` to both `px` and `py`. This changes the state of these two variables, but no other variables are affected. The preconditions regarding `n` and `a` remain valid as they were defined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and `a` is a list of integers of length n where each integer a_i is between 1 and 10^9; `px` is 0, `py` is 0**
