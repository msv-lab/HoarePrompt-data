Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of integers of length at least 3, `v` is the third element in the list `a`, `px` is now equal to (v - 1) // `y`, `py` is now equal to (v - 1) % `y`, `nx` is (v - 1) // `y`, and `ny` is (v - 1) % `y`. If the absolute difference between `(nx - px)` and `(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the program returns False. There is no else part, so nothing happens if that condition is not met.***
