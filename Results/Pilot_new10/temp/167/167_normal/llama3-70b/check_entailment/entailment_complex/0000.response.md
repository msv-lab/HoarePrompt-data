To determine if the provided annotated program is correct, we first need to break down the requirements of the problem description and then compare it with what the program does.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Matrix Construction**: The matrix `A` is defined such that each element at position `(i, j)` is given by the formula `A[i][j] = y * (i - 1) + j`. We need to find `x` (number of rows) and `y` (number of columns) such that the moves described in the input can be executed without breaking the rules of movement (moving to adjacent cells).
   
2. **Path Verification**: The program must verify if the path given by `a1, a2, ..., an` can be traversed as described.

3. **Output Requirements**: If valid values for `x` and `y` exist, they should be printed alongside a "YES". If no valid values exist that satisfy the path movement given the constraints of the matrix, "NO" must be printed.

### Program Analysis:
- The program begins by reading `n` (number of cells visited) and the sequence `a` (the integers representing visited cells).
  
- It uses nested loops to iterate through all potential values of `x` and `y` from `1` to `1000000`.

- Key checks:
  - There is a check to ensure that `x * y` is greater than the maximum value in `a`. This ensures that the matrix can accommodate all visited cells.
  - It checks that all values in `a` are within the valid range `[1, x * y]`.
  - The function `func_1` is called to validate if the traversed path maintains the adjacency rule.

### Function `func_1`:
- `func_1` effectively translates each value in `a` into its corresponding matrix coordinates `(nx, ny)`.
- It checks whether the differences in coordinates between subsequent points in the path are exactly 1 (which indicates they are adjacent).
- If any move is not valid according to adjacency rules, the function returns `False`. The valid coordinates moves imply a traversal of the matrix as described.

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Matrix Constraints**: The program correctly checks if the potential values of `x` and `y` are able to accommodate all the values in `a`.

2. **Path Adjacency**: The `func_1` accurately checks the adjacency of moves between cells as required.

3. **Output Requirements**: The program meets the conditional logic for printing "YES" with values of `x` and `y`, or printing "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program implements the described algorithm correctly according to the problem specification. It takes into account valid configurations of matrix size and checks the traversed path effectively.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**
