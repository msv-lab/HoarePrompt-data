You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a matrix A of size x × y filled with integers. For every $i \in [ 1 . . x ]$, $j \in [ 1 . . y ]$ A_{i}, j = y(i - 1) + j. Obviously, every integer from [1..xy] occurs exactly once in this matrix. 

You have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cells a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} denoting that you started in the cell containing the number a_1, then moved to the cell with the number a_2, and so on.

From the cell located in i-th line and j-th column (we denote this cell as (i, j)) you can move into one of the following cells: (i + 1, j) — only if i < x;  (i, j + 1) — only if j < y;  (i - 1, j) — only if i > 1;  (i, j - 1) — only if j > 1.

Notice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't know x and y exactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integer a_1, then move to the cell containing a_2 (in one step), then move to the cell containing a_3 (also in one step) and so on. Can you choose x and y so that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the integers in the cells on your path.


-----Output-----

If all possible values of x and y such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 contradict with the information about your path, print NO.

Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and in the second line print the values x and y such that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix. Remember that they must be positive integers not exceeding 10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
8
1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2

Output
YES
3 3

Input
6
1 2 1 2 5 3

Output
NO

Input
2
1 10

Output
YES
4 9



-----Note-----

The matrix and the path on it in the first test looks like this: [Image] 

Also there exist multiple correct answers for both the first and the third examples.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
for x in range(1, 1000001):
    for y in range(1, 1000001):
        if x * y > max(a):
            break
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')

def func_1(x, y):
    (px, py) = (0, 0)
    for v in a:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the constraint of the matrix's dimensions regarding the potential input values. Here are the issues:

1. **Inefficiency for Large `n`:** The matrix searching loop has a hardcoded upper limit of `1,000,000` for both dimensions, which doesn't account for the fact that the problem allows dimensions up to `1,000,000,000`. While the `max(a)` check technically ensures no value exceeds the valid range for matrix cells, it doesn't guarantee every valid scenario is checked.

2. **Incorrect Movement Validation:** The `func_1` function checks if the moves between numbers in the sequence are valid by verifying whether the Manhattan distance between corresponding cells is always exactly 1. However, this can lead to a contradiction in determining valid pathways especially when sequences of numbers can create ambiguous paths that seem valid in one dimension but contradict when checking in another dimension.

3. **Non-Exhaustive Checking of Dimensions:** By attempting dimensions `(x, y)` from `1 to 1,000,000`, the program can fail to find valid configurations that fall outside this range, even if a valid configuration should exist.

4. **Misinterpretation of Coordinates:** In the conversion from number to grid cells using `(nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)`, the calculation assumes the column-major layout does not account for how integers could be distributed (resulting in incorrect row/column translations).

Given these factors, an example that exposes the flaws would be a path that could potentially generate valid matrix configurations outside the limited dimensions of `1,000,000`. For instance, the path `[1, 999999, 999999]` requires moving to coordinates that are not feasible under the current constraints, thus exposing the logical inadequacy of the program in handling inputs comprehensively.

Hence, there are potential cases where the program does not fulfill the problem requirements, confirming its correctness is false.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `x` and a list of integers `a`. It checks if the coordinates derived from each element in `a` can be traversed sequentially in a grid-like manner, returning False if the moves between successive elements are not valid (i.e., not adjacent), and True if all moves are valid. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
