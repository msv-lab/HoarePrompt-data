You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a matrix A of size x × y filled with integers. For every $i \in [ 1 . . x ]$, $j \in [ 1 . . y ]$ A_{i}, j = y(i - 1) + j. Obviously, every integer from [1..xy] occurs exactly once in this matrix. 

You have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cells a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} denoting that you started in the cell containing the number a_1, then moved to the cell with the number a_2, and so on.

From the cell located in i-th line and j-th column (we denote this cell as (i, j)) you can move into one of the following cells: (i + 1, j) — only if i < x;  (i, j + 1) — only if j < y;  (i - 1, j) — only if i > 1;  (i, j - 1) — only if j > 1.

Notice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't know x and y exactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integer a_1, then move to the cell containing a_2 (in one step), then move to the cell containing a_3 (also in one step) and so on. Can you choose x and y so that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the integers in the cells on your path.


-----Output-----

If all possible values of x and y such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 contradict with the information about your path, print NO.

Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and in the second line print the values x and y such that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix. Remember that they must be positive integers not exceeding 10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
8
1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2

Output
YES
3 3

Input
6
1 2 1 2 5 3

Output
NO

Input

1 10

Output
YES
4 9



-----Note-----

Also there exist multiple correct answers for both the first and the third examples.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
for x in range(1, 1000001):
    for y in range(1, 1000001):
        if x * y > max(a):
            break
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')

def func_1(x, y):
    (px, py) = (0, 0)
    for v in a:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program behaves in relation to the described logic of traversing the matrix.

The matrix and traversal logic is founded on the transformation of a linear list of integers into a 2D matrix based on given row (`x`) and column (`y`) dimensions. The conditions require that the program identifies valid `x` and `y` such that the path defined by the sequence of integers can be walked according to specified movements.

### Key Points to Analyze:

1. **Matrix Index Calculation**: The mapping of integer `v` into 2D coordinates `(nx, ny)` is done using:
   - `nx = (v - 1) // y`
   - `ny = (v - 1) % y`

   This means that integer `1` maps to `(0, 0)`, `2` to `(0, 1)`, and so on. This mapping is straightforward, but let's analyze edge cases.

2. **Path Validation**:
   - The program ensures that the path's coordinates formed from the integers satisfy the rule of adjacent movements, `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1`. 
   - The check for both the indices and the path correctness needs to be validated across different input scenarios.

### Potential Edge Cases:

1. **Out-of-Bounds Values**: The program has nested loops that check dimensions `x` and `y` up to `1,000,000`, which is encapsulated in the conditions:
   - `(1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)`
   - If the maximum value in `a` exceeds the product of `x` and `y`, it would break the chain of checks in the loop prematurely.

2. **Path Repetitions**: The example input `6, [1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 3]` indicates that the path is invalid due to revisiting cells in a manner that doesn't adhere to adjacency, which the program handles correctly. However, if an input violates adjacency in a different manner, the program might incorrectly identify valid `x, y`.

3. **Single Element vs Multi-Element Paths**: For cases like:
   - Input `1`, `10` should give a clear result showing dimensions that don't contradict the requirement.
   - Inputs like `3 `, `[1, 10, 5]` could reveal issues if structured poorly.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program against the criteria given in the problem description and considering edge cases, I identified scenarios in which the logic could break down, specifically in validating potential `x` and `y` dimensions against a path that requires larger dimensions but falls outside the bounds.

**Correctness: **False**.**

For example, if the input is:
```
4
1 5 6 10
```
- The matrix needs to accommodate a non-adjacent path that the provided traversal cannot fulfill, hence the program would not accurately output a valid `x, y` or would inaccurately determine traversal validity. 

Thus, there are scenarios where the program does not correctly satisfy the problem requirements leading to the conclusion of false correctness.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
for x in range(1, 1000001):
    for y in range(1, 1000001):
        if x * y > max(a):
            break
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and a is a list of integers of length n where each integer a_i is between 1 and 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    px, py = 0, 0
    for v in a:
        nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
        
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        
        px, py = nx, ny
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `px` is (a[n-1] - 1) // y, `py` is (a[n-1] - 1) % y, `v` is the last element in the list `a`, `nx` is (a[n-1] - 1) // y, `ny` is (a[n-1] - 1) % y.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and a list of integers `a`. It checks if the coordinates derived from each element in `a` can be traversed sequentially in a grid-like manner, returning False if the moves between successive elements are not valid (i.e., not adjacent), and True if all moves are valid.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
