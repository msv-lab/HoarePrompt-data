Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it tries to find a value of `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime. However, the implementation has a major flaw regarding the function `func_1`, which defines the primality test.

Specifically, the function `func_1` will incorrectly mark `1` as a prime number. In the rules of primality, a prime number must be greater than `1`. Since `func_1` returns `False` for `x` equal to `1`, the code will work as expected for `m` that leads to `1` as an output, but there are possible scenarios where the loop may not find the correct output if it only checks primes for values greater than `1`. 

For example, consider `n = 1`. If `m = 1`, then `n * m + 1 = 1 * 1 + 1 = 2`, which is prime. The program will continue checking until a valid `m` is found that is not prime. However, if `m` is chosen such that `n * m + 1` leads to a situation where `n * m + 1 = 2`, the loop will never break since all other calculations that reach a prime number when `n = 1` might incorrectly try returning outputs when they shouldn't.

Thus, there are potential inputs for which the program does not correctly output a valid `m`, which could be demonstrated with specific inclinations toward certain `n` values. Hence, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential input cases.
