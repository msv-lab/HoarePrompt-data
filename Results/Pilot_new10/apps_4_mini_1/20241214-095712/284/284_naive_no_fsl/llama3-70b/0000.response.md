Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to find a value of `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. However, there is a flaw in the logic where it calls the function `func_1`, which is defined after the main loop that processes the input `n`.

In Python, if you try to call a function before it is defined, you will encounter a `NameError`. Consequently, the program will fail to execute properly. 

For example, if the input is `3`, the program will execute `n * m + 1` for `m = 1`, calling `func_1` since the function `func_1` hasn't been defined yet, leading to a failure.

Thus, even if the logic looks reasonable, the program will not function correctly because of the order of definition of the function and its usage. This breaks the requirement as it does not handle all potential cases appropriately, primarily the first case where it tries to execute.
