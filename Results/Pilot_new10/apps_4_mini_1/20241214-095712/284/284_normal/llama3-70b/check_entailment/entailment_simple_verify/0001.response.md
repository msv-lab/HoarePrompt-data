The original assessment is based on the assertion that the program will encounter a `NameError` when calling `func_1` because it is defined after it is first invoked in the loop. However, the provided annotated version of the code indicates that the `func_1` function is indeed defined after its invocation, which could lead to potential issues if the function call happens before its definition.

Given the problem description, the program is intended to find a positive integer `m` such that `n*m + 1` is not a prime number. The annotations confirm that the logic of checking if `num` is a prime number is correctly designed, aside from the execution flow related to the function's definition order.

In summary, while the logical part of the program could work correctly if the function definition were moved before its usage, the program as it stands will not execute successfully due to the aforementioned definition order causing a `NameError`. Therefore, the original assessment correctly identifies a fatal flaw in the current implementation that prevents the program from functioning as intended.

Final: **False**
