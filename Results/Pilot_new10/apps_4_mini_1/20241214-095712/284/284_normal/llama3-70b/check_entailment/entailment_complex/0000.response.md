The program aims to demonstrate that for a given positive integer \( n \), there exists a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. 

Analyzing the given program:

1. The input \( n \) is read correctly, and the loop runs for \( m \) values ranging from 1 to 1000, which satisfies the requirement \( 1 \leq m \leq 10^3 \).
  
2. The function `func_1` correctly implements a check for prime numbers. It returns `False` for any number less than 2 and checks for factors of the number for values from 2 up to the square root of the number.

3. The program looks for the first \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. If such an \( m \) is found, it is printed.

However, the function `func_1` has a critical flaw: it does not treat the number 1 correctly. According to the definition of prime numbers, 1 is not prime, but this function will return `True` for 1 (since it does not check for the exact value of 1, and 1 does not enter the loop).

For instance, if \( n = 1 \):
- When \( m = 1 \), \( n \cdot m + 1 = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 = 2 \) (which is prime), so it won't print anything until \( m = 2\).
- When \( m = 2 \), \( n \cdot m + 1 = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 = 3 \) (which is also prime), continuing in this manner leads to cases where the algorithm may not find a suitable \( m \) properly.

Thus, the function fails to properly address the required conditions outlined in the problem description because it can return erroneous results based on an incorrect prime checking mechanism. 

Overall, the function does not ensure there will always be a correctly identified counterexample \( m \) because it might mistakenly classify a non-prime scenario as prime, particularly at the critical boundary of 1.

Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
