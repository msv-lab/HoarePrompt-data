Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` fails to properly identify non-prime numbers when the input number is exactly 1. According to the definition of prime numbers, 1 is not considered a prime number, but in the current implementation, the function incorrectly returns `True` for 1. Therefore, if `n` is such that `n * m + 1` evaluates to 1 for any `m`, the program will mistakenly consider this output as valid (i.e., prime). 

For instance, if we set `n = 1`, the program will evaluate `1 * 1 + 1 = 2`, and for `m = 1`, no counterexample will be produced because it will consider 2 as a prime number, whereas `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` cannot show the failure of the hypothesis. Ideally, if `m = 1`, `n * m + 1` should yield a non-prime when valid (like if n = 1, which gives 2).

Thus, since the code may fail to output a valid `m` for certain cases due to the improper handling of the case when `num` is 1, the program does not satisfy the requirements in the problem description for all potential inputs.
