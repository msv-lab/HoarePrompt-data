According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the evaluated condition of `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since `num` is a positive integer that is greater than or equal to 2 and not divisible by 2, we need to evaluate the upper bound of the loop.

To determine if the loop can execute again:
- The current value of `i` is 2.
- The maximum limit for `i` is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. 
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

After this iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, leading to `i` being 3.
- Therefore, we require that `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again, meaning `int(num ** 0.5)` must be at least 3.

This implies that `num` must be at least \(3^2 = 9\) (since the square root of 9 is 3), which is consistent with the fact that `num` is not divisible by 2 and lies between 1 and 1000.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 9 that is odd (not divisible by 2).

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 9 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `num` is not divisible by 2, `i` is 3**
