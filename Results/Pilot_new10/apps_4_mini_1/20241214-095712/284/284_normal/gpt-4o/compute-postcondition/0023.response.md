To analyze the final output state of the loop, we need to observe how the values of the variables change as the loop executes. 

1. The variable `i` starts at 5 and increments by 6 in each iteration of the while loop.
2. The condition for the while loop is `i * i <= x`. Thus, the maximum value of `i` that can be encountered will be determined by the maximum value of `x`.
3. The loop checks if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. If `x` is not divisible by either, valid values for `x` will continue to produce iterations.

Given the initialization:
- `n` is a positive integer in the range 1 to 1000,
- `x` is greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, 
- the loop continues until `i` reaches a point where `i * i` exceeds `x`.

From the states provided:
- Output State after loop executes 1 time: 
  - `x` must be >= 25, which results in `i` being incremented to 11.
- Output State after loop executes 2 times: 
  - `x` must be >= 121, as `i` continues growing.
- Output State after loop executes 3 times: 
  - `x` must be >= (i + 6) * (i + 6) as `i` continues to increase.

After the loop exits, we know that `i` has to be such that `i * i` becomes greater than `x`, and the state of `i` will depend on how many times the loop can execute.

Typically:
- The loop will execute while `x` is larger than `i * i`, and will stop as soon as this condition fails. 
- The final value of `i` will be the first value for which `i * i` > `x`.

In the end:
- `i` must be such that `i * i > x`
- `x` remained greater than or equal to (the last checked value of `i` - 6) * (the last checked value of `i` - 6), maintaining the properties checked above.

Thus, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`i` is such that `i * i` is greater than `x`, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `(i - 6) * (i - 6)`, `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000**
