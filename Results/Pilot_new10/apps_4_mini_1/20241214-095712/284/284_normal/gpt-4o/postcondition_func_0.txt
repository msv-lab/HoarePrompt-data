The function accepts a positive integer `x` and determines if it is a prime number. It returns `False` if `x` is less than or equal to 1, or if it is divisible by 2 or 3. It also returns `False` if it has any divisors between 5 and the square root of `x` that are not multiples of 6 (i.e., checking for divisibility for numbers of the form 6k Â± 1). If none of these conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that `x` is a prime number.
