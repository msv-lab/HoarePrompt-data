To analyze the given program based on the problem description, let's dissect the code.

The goal is to find a positive integer `m` such that the expression `n * m + 1` results in a non-prime number for a given positive integer `n` in the range [1, 1000]. The program includes a function `func_1` which checks whether a number is prime.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program takes an input `n` and iterates through `m` values ranging from 1 to 1000.
2. For each `m`, it computes `n * m + 1` and checks if this result is not a prime by calling `func_1`.
3. If `func_1` returns `False`, meaning `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, it prints `m` and breaks the loop.

### Considering Edge Cases:
The core of the program is the `func_1` function which is designed to verify whether a given number is prime. There are no immediate flaws in the logic of the main program as it correctly follows the requirements (finding an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime). 

However, there is one potential issue regarding the range of values checked for `m`. The program assumes that it will always find a suitable `m` in the range of 1 to 1000, which is consistent with the problem statement guaranteeing that a solution exists within this range.

### Conclusion:
Let's consider an example:
- If `n = 1`, 
  - The program will iterate:
    - `m = 1`: `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (prime)
    - `m = 2`: `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (prime)
    - ...
    - All subsequent `m` will yield primes until `m = 4` (since `1 * 4 + 1 = 5` is still prime).
  - However, `m = 4` fails, and eventually, `m = 6` gives `1 * 6 + 1 = 7` which remains prime.

But since the problem guarantees that a non-prime will be found within the range, we can actually find suitable `m` values as `n` increases.

Yet, there exists a logical flaw:
If `n` itself is 1, there wouldn't be any suitable `m` found in the program since all increments would be yielding primes beyond a certain point. 

### Final Verification:
Thus, while the program will run and find a suitable `m` for most values of `n`, there is an inherent flaw in relying solely on the checks within the iterative range for some inputs like `n=1`, which could potentially create an infinite loop or scenario where no valid output occurs.

Therefore, the analysis yields:

Correctness: **False**.
