Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers, `n`, `a`, and `b`, from user input, representing a total number that must be constructed using non-negative integer coefficients of `a` and `b`. It iterates over possible coefficients for `a` (denoted as `x`), and for each `x`, it computes the corresponding coefficient for `b` (denoted as `y`). If there exist non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that their respective contributions (`x * a + y * b`) equal `n`, the function prints 'YES' followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If no such combination is found after checking all valid `x`, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
