The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, all initial values and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `x` is 1; `y` is updated to (n - a) // b; and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
