You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has n burles. One bottle of Ber-Cola costs a burles and one Bars bar costs b burles. He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.

Find out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly n burles.

In other words, you should find two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and x·a + y·b = n or tell that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

First line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) — amount of money, that Vasya has.

Second line contains single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.

Third line contains single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one Bars bar.


-----Output-----

If Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly n burles print «NO» (without quotes).

Otherwise in first line print «YES» (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers x and y — number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly n burles, i.e. x·a + y·b = n. If there are multiple answers print any of them.

Any of numbers x and y can be equal 0.

-----Note-----

In first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly 2·2 + 1·3 = 7 burles.

In second example Vasya can spend exactly n burles multiple ways:   buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and five Bars bars;  buy four bottles of Ber-Cola and don't buy Bars bars;  don't buy Ber-Cola and buy 10 Bars bars. 

In third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        y = (n - x * a) // b
        if x * a + y * b == n:
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the given program, let's break down its functionality:

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads three integers: `n` (total money), `a` (cost of a Ber-Cola bottle), and `b` (cost of a Bars bar).

2. **Finding Purchases**: The program attempts to iterate over possible values of `x` (the number of Ber-Cola bottles) starting from `0` up to `n // a`. For each `x`, it computes the corresponding value of `y` (the number of Bars bars) using the formula `y = (n - x * a) // b`.

3. **Checking for Exact Spend**: After calculating `y`, it verifies if `x * a + y * b` equals `n`. If it does, it prints "YES" along with `x` and `y`, and exits. If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, it prints "NO".

### Potential Cases to Consider

Now, let's explore if there are any edge cases where the program might fail:

1. **When `a` or `b` is larger than `n`**: If either `a` or `b` is larger than `n`, Vasya cannot buy any of that item. In that case, `x` or `y` should be handled correctly to still give a valid answer (zero price for one item and check if we can buy the other item). The current logic works here since `x` will be `0` and `y` might be `0` too.

2. **Exact division issues**: The use of integer division could lead to a situation where `(n - x * a) % b != 0`, thus resulting in a loss of cases where you could spend exactly `n`. However, the program checks if the condition actually satisfies the exact spend across the iteration.

3. **Exploring Corner Cases**: Consider testing with extreme values, such as `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and large edge cases like `n = 10,000,000`, `a = 9,999,999`, `b = 1`. 

### Testing Edge Cases

Let's look at an example where the algorithm fails:

- Input where n = 15, a = 4, b = 8 results in "NO", but if we check:
  - x = 0 → y = 15 / 8 = 1.875 (which isn't valid)
  - x = 1 → y = 11 / 8 = 1.375 (which isn't valid)
  - x = 2 → y = 7 / 8 = 0.875 (which isn't valid)
  - x = 3 → y = 3 / 8 = 0.375 (which isn't valid)
  - x = 4 → y = -1 / 8 is not possible

Each attempt here just shows an incorrect denomination without accounting for all possible combinations of x and y being non-negative integers.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the function, one potential area where it may misjudge is when considering the combinations leading to integer results being restricted within the bounds of a single factor not being able to fill in gaps of the formulation for `n`.

Thus:

Correctness: **False** 

The failure case can be if the cost of items leads to gaps where one cannot create valid purchase combinations summing to the money available.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        y = (n - x * a) // b
        
        if x * a + y * b == n:
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `x` is a non-negative integer such that `x <= n // a`; `y` is a non-negative integer such that `y = (n - x * a) // b for the final x value checked, or `y` is `n // b` if the loop does not execute.`
    print('NO')


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
