Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Let's break down the functionality to ensure it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, which represent the amount of money Vasya has and the costs of Ber-Cola and Bars, respectively. The conditions stated in the problem (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000) are acknowledged by the program.

2. **Loop and Calculation**: The program runs a loop for `x` starting from `0` to `n // a` (inclusive), which represents the maximum number of Ber-Cola bottles Vasya can purchase given his budget:
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `y` by rearranging the equation `x·a + y·b = n`, specifically solving for `y` with `y = (n - x * a) // b`. This computation effectively determines how many Bars bars can be purchased after selecting `x` bottles of Ber-Cola.

3. **Validation**: The program checks if `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, ensuring the specific spending condition is met.
   - If the condition holds true, it prints "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`.

4. **Exit the Loop**: If a valid solution (x, y) is found, the program exits immediately, effectively preventing further unnecessary computation.

5. **No Possible Combinations**: After checking all possible values of `x` and failing to find a valid pair (x, y), the program prints "NO", denoting that it's impossible for Vasya to spend exactly `n` burles under the given constraints.

Since every condition and requirement from the problem description is addressed in the logic of the program, it is accurate, and hence the program is correct for all valid input cases as mandated by the problem statement. Thus, the program properly checks the conditions and outputs the expected results accurately.
