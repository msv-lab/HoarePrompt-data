Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer, `n` is a valid integer such that `n // a` is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is 2, and `y` is calculated as (n - a) // b. The program checks if `(n - 2 * a) % b == 0`. If this condition is met, the program returns nothing. If the condition is not met, it returns nothing as well, as there is no value to be returned in either case.***
