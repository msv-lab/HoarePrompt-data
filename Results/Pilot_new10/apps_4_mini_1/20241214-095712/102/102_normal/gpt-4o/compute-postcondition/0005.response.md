The value of `y` is assigned to the expression `(n - x * a) // b`. Given that `x` is `0`, this simplifies the expression to `y = (n - 0 * a) // b`, which further simplifies to `y = n // b`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated output reflects that `y` is now calculated as `n // b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is a valid integer (can be negative); `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `n // b`.**
