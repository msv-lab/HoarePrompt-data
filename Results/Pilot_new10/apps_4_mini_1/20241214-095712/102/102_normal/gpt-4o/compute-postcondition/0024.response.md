The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it inherently relies on the integer variables `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000,000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, and 1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000,000. 

After executing the function's logic, the following outcomes can occur:
- **Case 1:** The program outputs the values x (which is 0) and y (calculated as n // b) without returning any specific value.
- **Case 2:** The program has a return statement without any expression, meaning it does not return a specific value. Instead, it outputs `1` and the value of y (calculated as (n - a) // b), while variables `a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- **Case 3:** The program completes without returning any value and does not output anything specific, effectively having no observable effect.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is as follows: it utilizes the integers `n`, `a`, and `b` and performs different output operations based on conditional checks, but does not return any value explicitly in any case.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters but relies on integers n, a, and b, producing various output results without returning values.**
