You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has n burles. One bottle of Ber-Cola costs a burles and one Bars bar costs b burles. He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.

Find out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly n burles.

In other words, you should find two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and x·a + y·b = n or tell that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

First line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) — amount of money, that Vasya has.

Second line contains single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.

Third line contains single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one Bars bar.


-----Output-----

If Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly n burles print «NO» (without quotes).

Otherwise in first line print «YES» (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers x and y — number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly n burles, i.e. x·a + y·b = n. If there are multiple answers print any of them.

Any of numbers x and y can be equal 0.

-----Note-----

In first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly 2·2 + 1·3 = 7 burles.

In second example Vasya can spend exactly n burles multiple ways:   buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and five Bars bars;  buy four bottles of Ber-Cola and don't buy Bars bars;  don't buy Ber-Cola and buy 10 Bars bars. 

In third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        if (n - x * a) % b == 0:
            y = (n - x * a) // b
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            return
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there are non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\). 

- It iterates over all possible counts of Ber-Cola bottles \(x\) that can be bought within the budget (i.e., from 0 to \(n // a\)).
- For each \(x\), it checks if there exists a valid count \(y\) of Bars bars by ensuring the remaining budget after purchasing \(x\) bottles of Ber-Cola is divisible by the cost of one Bars bar \(b\).
- If a valid combination is found, it prints "YES" along with the quantities \(x\) and \(y\). If no combination is valid after checking all possible values of \(x\), it appropriately prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all specified cases, including situations where either \(x\) or \(y\) can be zero, and satisfies all input constraints without any errors. Therefore, I don't see any examples where this program fails based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000,000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, and 1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000,000.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        if (n - x * a) % b == 0:
            y = (n - x * a) // b
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is a valid integer; `x` is `n // a`, and no valid `y` is calculated if `(n - x * a) % b != 0`. If at least one valid condition was met during the loop, then `y` is a non-negative integer derived from the condition that was satisfied; otherwise, `y` is undefined.
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers, `n`, `a`, and `b`, read from user input. It checks if `n` can be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of `a` and `b` (i.e., `n = x * a + y * b` for non-negative integers `x` and `y`). If a valid combination exists, it prints 'YES' along with values of `x` and `y`. If no valid combination is found after testing all possible values of `x`, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
