The value of `current_node` is updated by the expression `2 * current_node + 2`. The initial value of `current_node` is 0, so the calculation becomes `2 * 0 + 2 = 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary string of length `h`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 2, and `direction` is not '0'.
