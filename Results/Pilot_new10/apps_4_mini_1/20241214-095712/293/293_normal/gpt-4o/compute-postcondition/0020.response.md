The value of `visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` was 4, so the new value becomes 5. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is 2, `n` is 2, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 5, `current_level` is an integer with a value relevant to the logic, and `path` is a binary string of length `h` that must have at least `h` characters for the next character to be valid.**
