The assignment `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` updates the value of `current_node`. The previous value of `current_node` is 0. Therefore, the new value will be calculated as follows:

```
current_node = 2 * 0 + 1 = 1
```

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary string of length `h`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is now 1, and the `direction` is '0'.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary string of length `h`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 1, and the `direction` is '0'**.
