The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the reasons for this conclusion:

1. **Traversal Logic**: The algorithm described in the problem mentions that Amr should follow commands 'L' and 'R' to navigate through the tree (where 'L' indicates going to the left child and 'R' to the right child). In binary tree indexing terms, the problem does not state the internal representation as '0' for left and '1' for right. Instead, the rules of how Amr navigates and counts visited nodes are based on the commands provided in the infinite string "LRLRLRLR...".

2. **Skipping of Visited Nodes**: The problem states that if Amr visits a node that has already been visited, he should skip that command. The provided program does not account for this skipping logic, nor does it account for the case where Amr skips two consecutive commands and should revert to the parent.

3. **Count Mechanism**: The current program simply counts visited nodes based on the length of the path determined by converting `n` to a binary string and then recounting nodes as it traverses down this path. This does not account for the rules outlined in the problem, which require a complex traversal process including backtracking under certain conditions.

4. **Leaf Node Logic**: The output required is the count of nodes visited before reaching the specified exit (the leaf node denoted by `n`), but the logic does not include the necessary conditions that would reduce or alter this count based on revisiting or skipping nodes.

For all these reasons, the program will yield incorrect outputs for various test inputs as stated in the problem description because it fundamentally misunderstands the traversal algorithm that Amr employs in the game. 

Correctness: **False**
