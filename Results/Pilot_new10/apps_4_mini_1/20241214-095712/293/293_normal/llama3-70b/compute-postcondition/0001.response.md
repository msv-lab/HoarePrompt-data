In the provided code snippet, the variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The initial values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The previous constraints for `h` and `n` still hold true. 

Output State: **`h` is input_h, `n` is input_n, where 1 ≤ input_h ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ input_n ≤ 2^input_h; `ans` is 0**
