The variable `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` must be greater than 2, the result of `n // 2` will always be at least 1. The initial values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is equal to input_h, `n` is greater than 2, and `ans` is increased by `n // 2`.

Output State: **`h` is equal to input_h, `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is increased by `n // 2**
