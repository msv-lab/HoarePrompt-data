The code `ans += n // 2 - 1` updates the variable `ans`. The expression `n // 2` computes the integer division of `n` by 2, and then 1 is subtracted from that result. Given that `n` must be greater than 2, `n // 2` will yield at least 1. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` becomes its previous value plus `(n // 2 - 1)`.

Since `ans` is incremented by this value, the exact new value of `ans` depends on its initial value, which is unspecified in the initial state.

Output State: **`h` is equal to `input_h`, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is increased by (n // 2 - 1)**
