The value of `ans` is incremented by `n // 2 - 1`. Since `n` must be greater than 2, `n // 2` will always be at least 1, resulting in `ans` being updated. The state of `h` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the code. The output will reflect the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`h` is equal to input_h, `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is incremented by `n // 2 - 1**.
