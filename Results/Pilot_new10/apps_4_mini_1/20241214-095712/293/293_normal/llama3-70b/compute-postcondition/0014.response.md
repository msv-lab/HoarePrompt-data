According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is now equal to `n // 2`, which implies that `n` is currently greater than 2 but must be adjusted to ensure it stays greater than 1 after the next iteration. 

Since `n` is greater than 2 post-adjustment (`n` could be 3, 4, 5, etc., but must be reduced in the next iteration), and calculating `n // 2` would reduce `n`, the significant state that needs adjustment is to ensure that `n` must be greater than 2 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`h` is equal to `input_h`, `n` must be greater than 2**
