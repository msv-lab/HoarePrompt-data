You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr bought a new video game "Guess Your Way Out!". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means "go to the left child of the current node";  Character 'R' means "go to the right child of the current node";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2

Output
2
Input
2 3

Output
5
Input
3 6

Output
10
Input
10 1024

Output
2046


-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

Program:
```
def func():
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ans += n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ans += n // 2
        n //= 2
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the algorithm implemented in the code.

The task requires Amr to navigate a perfect binary tree of height `h` starting from the root node, and the exit node is located at node `n`. The problem describes how Amr follows a specific path based on commands 'L' and 'R', and how he counts the nodes he visits before reaching the exit.

The provided implementation is as follows:

```python
def func():
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ans += n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ans += n // 2
        n //= 2
    print(ans)
```

### Analysis

1. **Understanding the input and output**:
   - Input consists of two integers `h` and `n`.
   - Output is an integer representing the number of nodes Amr visits before reaching node `n`.

2. **Logic of the Program**:
   - The loop continues as long as `n > 1`. Thus, it effectively tracks the path from the leaf (node `n`) back to the root.
   - The lines inside the loop calculate contributions to `ans` based on whether `n` is even or odd.
   - The key operations are `n //= 2`, which moves the reference of `n` up the tree, and the conditions to update `ans`.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - Let's evaluate specific cases:
     - For the case `h = 1` and `n = 2`, it properly counts nodes, which should be 2 (the steps are Root -> Left -> Leaf).
     - For `h = 2` and `n = 3`, the expected output is 5 (1, 2, 1 from Root to Left to Right Leaf which counts as five visits: Root, Left, Right, Left returns, and Right).
     - For `h = 3` and `n = 6`, track the path: visits are counted correctly (Root to Left, Left to Right, Left, and Right) corroborates to count 10.

4. **Identifying Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is at the maximum value of `2^h`, i.e., the last node in the last level, the calculations `ans += n // 2` help in accumulating the visits correctly, but if `n` does not equal a power of 2, it could lead to off issues in increments should the tree structure be inferred incorrectly by the program.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Upon reviewing various values for `n` based on `h`, including edge values and how `ans` behaves while calculating, the design of the loop and conditions does indeed traverse correctly towards the output of nodes visited.
   - However, the decrement logic while following the structure can lead to an accurate calculation, provided the conditions are consistent.

Given the analysis of potential test cases and logical deductions from the way the algorithm approaches counting nodes, I can't find cases where the implementation fails based on the defined problem.

Correctness: **True**. 

The implementation is correct given that it accurately counts the nodes visited according to the problem's specified algorithm and examples provided.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers `h` and `n` from input, processes them in a loop to calculate a sum `ans` based on the values of `n` as it is halved. Specifically, for every even `n`, it adds `n // 2 - 1` to `ans`, and for odd `n`, it adds `n // 2`. The process continues until `n` becomes 1, at which point the loop exits and `ans` is printed. If `n` begins as 1, the loop does not execute, leaving `ans` at 0. The function does not return any values, only printing the final result. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
