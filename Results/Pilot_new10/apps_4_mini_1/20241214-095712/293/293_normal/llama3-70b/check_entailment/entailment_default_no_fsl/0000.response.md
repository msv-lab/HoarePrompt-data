Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately implement the logic described in the problem statement. The main issue lies in the calculation of the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit. 

The program uses the following logic to calculate the visits:
- For an even `n`, it adds `n // 2 - 1` to the answer.
- For an odd `n`, it adds `n // 2`.

However, this approach is fundamentally flawed because it does not properly simulate the traversal through the binary tree as outlined in the problem. Specifically, it fails to account for:
1. The traversal order and the skipping of nodes. The alternating 'L' and 'R' commands dictate that Amr visits the left and right children in a specific manner, which isn't mirrored in the mathematical approach used in the program.
2. The requirement to skip nodes that have already been visited and the behavior of going back to the parent node after skipping two consecutive commands.

An example that highlights this flaw is as follows:
- For the input `h = 1` and `n = 2`, the expected output is `2`, indicating that Amr visits all nodes before reaching the exit. The program outputs `1`, which is incorrect.
  
Given the discrepancy in output and logic as compared to the problem description, the program does not correctly handle all cases. Thus, the conclusion is that it is incorrect.
