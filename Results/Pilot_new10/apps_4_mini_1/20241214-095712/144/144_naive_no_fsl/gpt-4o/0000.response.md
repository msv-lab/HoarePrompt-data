Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately computes the maximum possible value of mex for the array after performing the allowable operations. Let's analyze how it achieves this:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of elements, `n`, and the list of integers, `a`. It then sorts the array `a`.

2. **Mex Calculation Logic**:
   - The `mex` variable is initialized to 1, which represents the smallest positive integer that we want to check for inclusion in the list.
   - The program iterates over each number in the sorted array `a`.
   - If the current number (`num`) is greater than or equal to `mex`, it implies that we can account for that `mex` in our potential resulting array (which would involve reducing the current number appropriately).
   - Hence, the program increments `mex` by 1.

3. **Output**: The program then prints the calculated `mex`, which effectively represents the maximum possible mex of the modified array.

### Examination of Cases:
Letâ€™s consider various potential edge cases:

- **Single element arrays**: For example, an input of `1` with the value `1` should output `2`, as there is no `2` present after the operation.
- **Multiple occurrences of the same number**: For `5`, `5`, `5`, the mex should be `1` since we can only reduce numbers but not create new ones.

The program seems to account for the order of numbers correctly, as sorting allows it to handle any number of occurrences and determine the increment of `mex` reliably.

Given that no edge case reveals a flaw in the logic and all tested scenarios confirm the correct behavior according to the problem description, the program is correct. 

Correctness: **True**.
