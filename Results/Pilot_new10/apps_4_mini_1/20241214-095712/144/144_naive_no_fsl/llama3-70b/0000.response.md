Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle cases where it's necessary to reduce certain elements of the array to maximize the mex. A counterexample can be seen in the following input:

Input:
```
4
1 2 2 4
```

In this case, the maximum possible mex is 3. However, the program would output 5 because it expects to iterate through the sorted array directly and check for sequential numbers starting from 1. It does not consider the need to reshape elements to create the gaps needed to achieve a higher mex value.

The correct approach would involve examining the possible manipulation of the integers down to ensure we have consecutive integers from 1 through the highest mex achievable based on available counts of each integer. By only sorting and checking for matches directly without consideration of potential reductions, the program fails to correctly evaluate the problem's requirements in all cases.
