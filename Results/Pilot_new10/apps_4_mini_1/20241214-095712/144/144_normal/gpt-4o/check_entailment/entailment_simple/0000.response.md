Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` (the number of elements) and a list `a` of `n` positive integers.

2. **Sorting**: It sorts the array `a`. This is necessary to correctly compute the maximum possible value of mex since the mex is influenced by the smallest numbers in the array.

3. **Calculating Mex**: The program initializes `mex` to 1, which is the smallest positive integer. It then iterates through the sorted list of numbers:
   - If the current number (`num`) is greater than or equal to `mex`, it means that `mex` can be constructed from elements present in the array. Thus, it increments `mex` by 1. This continues until the end of the array.
   - The logic correctly simulates the process of "decreasing" elements in the array to ensure the desired maximum mex is reached.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the computed value of `mex`, which represents the maximum possible mex after the allowed operations.

The algorithm is efficient, operating within O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and subsequently in O(n) for the iteration, making it suitable given the constraints.

Overall, the implementation adheres to the problem's requirements, calculating the maximum possible value of mex after the operations correctly. Thus, the program is verified as correct.
