The variable `mex` is incremented by 1 with the statement `mex += 1`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `num` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `mex`, while retaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `a`, `mex` is the current modified value incremented by 1.**
