Since the code snippet is simply printing the value of `mex` without altering any state or performing calculations, we need to determine the context of `mex`. 

Given that `mex` is defined as the smallest positive integer not represented in the sorted list `a`, and `a` contains `n` positive integers, it is expected that `mex` holds a valid value upon execution.

We were not provided with the specific values of `a` or `mex`, but based on the definition of `mex`, we can say that it is a positive integer that could range from 1 to `n + 1`, depending on the content of `a`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is the smallest positive integer not represented in the list `a`, and we print the value of `mex`.**
