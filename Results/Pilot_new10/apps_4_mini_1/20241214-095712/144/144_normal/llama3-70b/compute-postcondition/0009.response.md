The execution of the `break` statement does not change any variable values, but it causes an immediate exit from the most internal loop or conditional block that is currently being executed. Therefore, no variables have been affected in their values, but the flow of control in the program has been altered.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 1; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n`; `num` is the first element of `arr`, which is not equal to `mex`, and `num` is greater than `mex`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
