Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 3; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n` with at least 3 elements, and `num` is the third element in the list `arr`. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
