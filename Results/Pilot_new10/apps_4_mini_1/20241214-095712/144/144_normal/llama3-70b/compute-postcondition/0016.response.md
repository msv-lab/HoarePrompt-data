Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 3; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n` with at least 2 elements. If the second element `num` of `arr` is equal to `mex`, then `mex` is updated to 3; if `num` is greater than 2, we break out of the most internal loop.***
