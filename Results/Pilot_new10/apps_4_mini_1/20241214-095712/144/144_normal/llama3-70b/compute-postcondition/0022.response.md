Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is the smallest positive integer that is not in `arr`; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n`. If the loop executes fully, it means that `mex` has been increased for every number in `arr` up to the maximum value of the elements in the array; if the loop doesn't execute due to the first element being greater than 1, `mex` remains 1.**
