To examine the conditions under which the loop can execute, let's analyze the program state and the loop itself stepwise.

1. The loop is structured as `for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):`. This means that the loop will start with `i` equal to `t - 1` and will continue running as long as `i` is greater than `0`, decrementing `i` by `1` on each iteration.

2. The initial state requirements for the loop to execute correctly is that `t - 1` must be at least `1` for the range to contain any integers. If `t - 1` is less than `1`, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. Given that `t` is an integer input value between `2` and `100`, the minimum value of `t` is `2`, which makes `t - 1` equal to `1`. Hence, the loop will execute exactly once when `t` is `2`. For any value of `t` greater than `2`, the loop will execute more than once.

4. Consequently, the essential states indicating the loop's starting parameters can be defined as follows:
   - The loop will execute successfully under the condition that `t` must be at least `2` (which it inherently is, given the initial constraints).
   - Before the loop begins, `i` is initialized to `t - 1`.

Based on this analysis, the adjusted states before the loop execution should reflect the requirement that `t` must remain at least `2` and indicate the initial value of `i`.

State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 2 or greater, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`**
