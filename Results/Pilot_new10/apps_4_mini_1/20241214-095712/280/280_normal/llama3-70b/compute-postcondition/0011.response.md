According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `i`, which can be updated by decreasing it by 1 at the start of each iteration. The loop condition is that `i` must be at least 0 to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t - 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will become `t - 2`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the last iteration, given that `t` is 2 or greater, `i` is currently `t - 1`, which means it could be as low as 1 (if `t` is 2) or higher. However, for the upcoming iteration, we require `i` to decrement to `t - 2`, which still satisfies the loop condition unless `t` is very small.

Hence, updating the states, we have:
- `i` becomes `t - 2`.
- The values of `v_1`, `v_2`, `d`, `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, and `min_length` remain unchanged since they are not updated within the loop statement itself.

State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 2 or greater, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is either `max_speed - d` or `min_speed`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_speed * (t + 1)`, `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 1)`, `i` is `t - 2`**
