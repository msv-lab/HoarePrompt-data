The variable `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`. The initial state indicates that `min_length` is calculated as `min_speed * t`, and with the addition of `min_speed`, the new value of `min_length` becomes `min_length + min_speed`, which simplifies to `min_speed * t + min_speed`, or `min_speed * (t + 1)`.

The other variables retain their initial conditions without change. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated value of `min_length`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 2 or greater, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is either `max_speed - d` or `min_speed`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_speed * (t + 1)`, `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 1)`, `i` is `t - 1`**.
