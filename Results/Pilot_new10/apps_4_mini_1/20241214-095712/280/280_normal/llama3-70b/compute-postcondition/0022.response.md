The code snippet provided contains a `print` statement, which outputs the value of `max_length`. Since `max_length` is defined as `max_speed * t`, and there's no modification to `max_length` within the code, it retains its previous value. The variables `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, and `min_length` depend on the values of `t` and `d`, as explained in the initial state.

Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected. We keep all the preconditions valid after execution.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer value between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is equal to `max_speed - (t - 1) * d` or `min_speed`, `min_speed` is equal to `min_speed + (t - 1) * d`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, and `max_length` has been printed.`
