In the given code, `min_length` is updated by adding `min_speed` to its current value. The states of the other variables will not change, but we need to take into account the initial value of `min_length` which is derived from the expression `min_speed * (t + 1)`.

Let's summarize the impact of the code:
- `min_length` will be updated to `min_length + min_speed`, where the original `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 1)`. Therefore, the new value will be `min_speed + (min_speed * (t + 1))`, which simplifies to `min_speed * (t + 2)`.

Now we state the output with the updated value for `min_length` and the preserved states of the other variables:

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 2 or greater, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 2)`, `i` is `t - 2`, `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`**
