Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer value between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is equal to `max_speed - (t - 1) * d` or `min_speed`, `min_speed` is equal to `min_speed + (t - 1) * d`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, and if `t` is 1, the loop does not execute, leaving `max_speed` and `min_speed` unchanged, and `max_length` and `min_length` equal to `max_speed * t` and `min_speed * t` respectively.**
