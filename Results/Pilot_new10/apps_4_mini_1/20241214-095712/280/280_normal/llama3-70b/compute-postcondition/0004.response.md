In this scenario, `max_length` is assigned the value of `max_speed * t`. The values for `max_speed` and `t` are already defined: `max_speed` is the greater of `v_1` and `v_2`, while `t` is an integer between 2 and 100. The previous values of `v_1` and `v_2` are still valid and affect the calculation of `max_speed`. Other variables (`v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `min_speed`) remain unchanged. However, `max_length` will take on a new calculated value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` is an integer input value between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer input value between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer input value between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer input value between 0 and 10; `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v_1` and `v_2`, `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v_1` and `v_2`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer input value between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer input value between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer input value between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer input value between 0 and 10; `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v_1` and `v_2`, `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v_1` and `v_2`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`.**
