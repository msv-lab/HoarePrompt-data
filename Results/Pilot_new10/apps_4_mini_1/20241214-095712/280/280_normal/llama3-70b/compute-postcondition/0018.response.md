The value of `min_speed` is updated based on the formula `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`. The previous value of `min_speed` is incremented by `d`, but it is capped at the value of `max_speed`. Therefore, `min_speed` can either be `min_speed + d` if it is less than `max_speed`, or it remains `max_speed` if `min_speed + d` exceeds `max_speed`. 

The initial conditions:

- `min_speed` is updated according to the rule above.
- `max_speed` remains unchanged at this time.

Thus, the Output State maintains all the initial conditions while reflecting the updated value of `min_speed`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than 3, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 2)`, `i` is `t - 3`, `max_speed` is still `max_speed`**
