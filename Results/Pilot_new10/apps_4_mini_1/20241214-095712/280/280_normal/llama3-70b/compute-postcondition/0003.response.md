The variable `min_speed` is assigned the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`. The initial state indicates that both `v_1` and `v_2` are between 1 and 100. Therefore, `min_speed` will be a value between 1 and 100 as well. The states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer input value between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer input value between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer input value between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer input value between 0 and 10; `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v_1` and `v_2`, `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v_1` and `v_2`.**
