To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop code and the initial state of the variables. Given the loop runs for a range of `1` to `t-1` (i.e., `t-1` iterations), we can deduce what happens during the iterations.

1. The initial state gives:
   - `speeds[0] = v_1`
   - `speeds[-1] = v_2`
   - Remaining elements of `speeds` are zeroes.

2. The update logic in the loop:
   ```
   speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
   ```
   means that `speeds[i]` is calculated as the minimum of two values:
   - The first value (`speeds[i - 1] + d`) indicates a sequential increase based on the previous speed plus `d`.
   - The second value (`v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`) is a cap determined by `v2` and how many steps are remaining (`t - i - 1`).

After executing the loop `t - 1` times, we reach the final state for `speeds` from `speeds[0]` to `speeds[t-1]`. The states rely on both original speeds (`v_1`, `v_2`) and the additional `d` applied over the iterations.

If the loop does not execute (when `t < 2`), the variables remain as follows:
- `speeds[0] = v_1`
- `speeds[-1] = v_2`
- Other elements remain as zeroes.

**Output State:**
- If `t >= 2`: `v_1` is user-defined integer, `v_2` is user-defined integer, `t` is the user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d)`, continuing in the same manner up to `speeds[t-1]`, which would be computed based on the logic of the loop.
- If `t < 2`: `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, remaining elements of `speeds` are zeroes.

Given this detailed analysis, the concise output state accounting for all iterations completed within the specified bounds is:
Output State: **`v_1` is user-defined integer, `v_2` is user-defined integer, `t` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[1]` through `speeds[t-2]` are computed as defined in the loop logic up to `speeds[t-1]`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, remaining elements of `speeds` are zeros.**
