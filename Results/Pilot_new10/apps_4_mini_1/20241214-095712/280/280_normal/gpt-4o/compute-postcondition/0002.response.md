The code initializes a list called `speeds` with `t` elements, all set to 0. The values of `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d` remain unchanged; however, the list `speeds` now contains `t` zeroes.

Output State: **`v_1` and `v_2` are integers defined by user input; `t` is an integer between 2 and 100; `d` is an integer between 0 and 10; `speeds` is a list of `t` zeroes.**
