The function `func` does not take any parameters directly. Instead, it relies on the conditions provided in the constraints related to `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. 

Given the constraints:
- `v_1` and `v_2` are integers such that \( 1 \leq v_1, v_2 \leq 100 \).
- `t` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq t \leq 100 \).
- `d` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq d \leq 10 \).

However, the output behavior of the function has not been specified. If we had output behavior to analyze, we'd detail that here, including conditions and return statements.

As the output behavior is unspecified, I cannot adequately describe the functionality yet. For a complete analysis, I'd need the details of what outputs the function provides based on the parameters described above or any further information about the function's logic.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates based on internal or external variables `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d` that adhere to defined integer constraints. The exact output behavior is unspecified.**
