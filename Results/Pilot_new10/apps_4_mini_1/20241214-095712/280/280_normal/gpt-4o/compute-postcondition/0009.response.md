According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `t - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `t` is 2 or more, which means that for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to become 3. Since `t` is 2, `i` will no longer satisfy the condition for the loop to run again.

State: **`v_1` is user-defined integer, `v_2` is user-defined integer, `t` is 2 or more, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, remaining elements of `speeds` are zeroes, `i` is 3**
