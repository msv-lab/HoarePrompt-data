The variables `t` and `d` are assigned values from user input, where the input is provided in a format that consists of two integers separated by a space. The previous values of `v_1` and `v_2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Given the constraints provided:
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, which will be satisfied as the user inputs a valid integer.
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, which will also be satisfied based on the input.

Therefore, the output state includes the new values of `t` and `d` as the input from the user, while the values of `v_1` and `v_2` remain undefined.

Output State: **`v_1` and `v_2` are integers defined by user input; `t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10.**
