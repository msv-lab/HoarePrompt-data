You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly account for the maximum speed change allowed between adjacent seconds when calculating the speeds. Specifically, it only considers the previous speed (`speeds[i - 1] + d`) and does not adequately check the lower bound or effectively utilize the parameter `d` to ensure that the final speed `v2` can still be reached given the time `t`.

For example, consider the input:

```
3 10
5 2
```

According to the problem statement, the car starts at a speed of `3` m/s and should end at `10` m/s after `5` seconds, with a maximum acceleration of `2` m/s per second. However, the program may generate speeds that do not conform to the requirement of maintaining a maximum difference of `2` between consecutive seconds while still achieving the final speed of `10` m/s.

Following the program’s logic, it might produce:
- speeds[0] = 3
- speeds[1] = 5 (3 + 2)
- speeds[2] = 7 (5 + 2)
- speeds[3] = 9 (7 + 2)
- speeds[4] = 10 (last second must be `v2`)

This results in the total distance calculated as `3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 10 = 34`. However, a valid speed sequence could have been `3, 5, 7, 9, 10` but does not consider the potential for having larger speeds more consistently at the beginning.

Thus, this highlights the inconsistency in handling speed transitions properly, resulting in a mismatch with the permitted range of changes, proving it incorrect for some cases. The logic fails to maximize the covered distance while adhering to the speed change constraint effectively in all cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts no parameters but reads input integers v1, v2, t, and d, calculating a speed list based on these values. It initializes the first speed as v1 and the last as v2, filling in intermediate speeds constrained by the values of v2 and d. Finally, it computes and prints the sum of the speeds. The function's behavior is entirely reliant on user input and does not handle erroneous or out-of-bound inputs, thus, if invalid data is provided, it may lead to unexpected results or errors. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
