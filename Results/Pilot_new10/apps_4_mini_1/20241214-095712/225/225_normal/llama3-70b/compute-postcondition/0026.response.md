To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the conditions it checks.

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, hence it has a length between 1 and 100.
   - `vowels` contains the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`, and it must be between 1 and 100.
   - `max_jump` starts at 0.
   - `last_vowel` starts at -1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates `n` times (where `n` is the length of `s`).
   - For each character in `s`, if the character is a vowel, the loop updates `last_vowel` to the current index and computes the `max_jump` based on the positions of the vowels encountered.

3. **Output Condition After Loop Execution**:
   - The final value of `max_jump` will depend on the positions of all vowels found in the input string `s`.
   - If there are no vowels in the string, `last_vowel` will remain -1, and `max_jump` will stay 0.
   - If there are vowels, `last_vowel` will represent the index of the last vowel found, and `max_jump` will be the maximum jump calculated based on the distance between consecutive vowels.

Given these insights, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s` or remains -1 if none found, and `max_jump` is the maximum jump calculated based on the positions of vowels in `s`.**
