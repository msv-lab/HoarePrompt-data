The variable `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of the expression `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Given that `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, it confirms there are characters after the last vowel, allowing the calculation to proceed positively. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s` (or -1 if none found), `max_jump` is updated to max(current `max_jump`, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)**
