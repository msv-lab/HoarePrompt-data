The expression `max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)` assigns a new value to `max_jump`. It takes the maximum of the current value of `max_jump` and `i + 1`. The initial value of `max_jump` is set to 1 and `i` is currently 1. Therefore, `i + 1` equals 2. 

So, the variables are impacted as follows:
- The current value of `max_jump` is 1, and the calculated value of `i + 1` is 2. The maximum of 1 and 2 is 2.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `last_vowel` stays as 0, `max_jump` is 2, and `i` is 1**.
