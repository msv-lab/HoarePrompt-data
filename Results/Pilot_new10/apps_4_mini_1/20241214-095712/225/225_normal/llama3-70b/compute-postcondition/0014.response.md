According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n` and the value of `i`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 0 if the character at position `i` in `s` is a vowel. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 1, it will allow the loop to execute again as long as `n` remains greater than 1 for subsequent iterations.

Therefore, updating the states:
- `last_vowel` remains at 0 unless the new character at the incremented index triggers an update.
- `max_jump` remains at 1.

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `last_vowel` stays as 0, `max_jump` is set to 1, and `i` is 1**
