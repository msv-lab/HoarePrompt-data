The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It calculates the minimum jump ability the Grasshopper needs to reach the end of the string by jumping only on the vowels. 

Analyzing the function `func_1`, it goes through the string to find all vowel positions and calculates the maximum distance between them, considering the distance from the starting point to the first vowel and from the last vowel to the end of the string. In situations where there are no vowels, the function appropriately returns the length of the string, as mentioned in the output hints.

The output hints reinforce the function's behavior and align with the problem description, confirming that the function captures all necessary scenarios. Moreover, the original assessment stating that the program's correctness is "True" is supported by the detailed logic within the function, which effectively meets the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Since the program meets the problem description criteria and correctly identifies jump ability in various test case scenarios (including edge cases), the original assessment is valid.

Final: **True**
