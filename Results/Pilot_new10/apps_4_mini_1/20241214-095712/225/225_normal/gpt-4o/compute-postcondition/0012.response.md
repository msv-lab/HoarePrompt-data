According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is at a position where the loop checks if it can continue. Since the loop iterates over the range of `len(s)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `prev_pos` is updated to `i` when `s[i]` is a vowel, we must also check the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` is currently the last index of `s` (i.e., `len(s) - 1`), the loop will not execute again. But since it's noted that `s` is non-empty and `i` could be any index from `0` to `len(s) - 1`, we can conclude that `i` must be incremented, making `i` equal to `len(s)` for the loop to terminate.

Therefore, if `i` is still within bounds for the next iteration, we can state that `i` will be `i + 1`, while `prev_pos` may or may not have changed depending on whether `s[i]` was a vowel.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, prev_pos is updated to the last position of the last vowel encountered, `i` is equal to len(s)**
