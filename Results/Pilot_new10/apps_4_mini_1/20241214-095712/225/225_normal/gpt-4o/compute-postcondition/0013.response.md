The `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value or the result of `i - prev_pos`. Here, `i` is equal to `len(s)`, which is the length of the string `s`. The `prev_pos` is the last position of the last vowel encountered in `s`. The values of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `prev_pos` is updated to the last position of the last vowel encountered, `i` is equal to len(s), and `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)**.
