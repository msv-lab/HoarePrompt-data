The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and the difference between the length of the string `s` and `prev_pos`. Since `prev_pos` can be -1 if no vowels exist, the calculation `len(s) - prev_pos` can yield a value greater than the current value of `max_jump`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value of `max_jump`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters; `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}; `max_jump` is max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos); `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`, which can be -1 if no vowels exist.**
