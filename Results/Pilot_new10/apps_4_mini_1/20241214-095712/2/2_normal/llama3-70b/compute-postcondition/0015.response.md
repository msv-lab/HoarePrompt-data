To analyze the impact of the given code, we first look at the initial state:

- `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`
- `max_sum` is updated to 2
- `max_num` is updated to 2
- `i` is 3
- `digit_sum` is equal to 2
- `x` must be greater than or equal to 3

Next, we examine the code:

```python
digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
```

In this line, `digit_sum` is recalculated by converting `i` (which is 3) to a string, iterating over each digit (which is just '3' in this case), converting it back to an integer, and summing it up. Since `i` is 3, `digit_sum` will be:

- `digit_sum = sum(int('3')) = 3`

Now, we summarize the changes:

- `digit_sum` is updated to 3 (it was previously equal to 2)

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 2, `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3**.
