`max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. The value of `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, which means that after this assignment, `max_sum` will equal `digit_sum`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1.**
