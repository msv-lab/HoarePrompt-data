To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the code:

1. The loop runs from `1` to `x`, inclusive. Since `x` can be as large as `10^18`, the loop will iterate `x` times.
2. In each iteration, `digit_sum` is calculated as the sum of the digits of the current value of `i`.
3. The variables `max_sum` and `max_num` hold the maximum digit sum encountered so far and the corresponding number, respectively.
4. Initially, both `max_sum` and `max_num` are `0`.

After completing all iterations:
- The maximum possible `digit_sum` occurs at the highest number `x`, where the sum of its digits is achieved.
- The loop will always execute for all integer values from `1` to `x`, thus guaranteeing that at least one value is processed.

Based on the nature of the loop, it is clear that:
- The maximum `digit_sum` will be obtained for a number configuration where the sum of digits is largest. For instance, for `x = 999999999999999999`, the highest digit sum can be derived from `i = 999999999999999999` which gives `digit_sum = 81` (with each digit being `9`).
- After all iterations, `max_sum` would hold the maximum digit sum calculated over all possible `i` from `1` to `x`, and `max_num` would hold the number that corresponds to that maximum digit sum.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop completes is as follows:

Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum digit sum obtained from any number between 1 and `x`, `max_num` is the corresponding number for that maximum digit sum, `x` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18.**
