Correctness: **False**

The program does not implement the correct logic to determine whether it is possible to transform matrix B (initially full of 0s) into matrix A using the allowed operations. The logic checks if at least one of the elements of a 2x2 submatrix in A is 1, but it does not ensure that the necessary conditions for covering all required positions of 1s in A with 2x2 blocks are met.

For example, the following input:

```
3 3
1 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```

Here, we can see that the bottom right corner of the matrix A will never be reachable since it's not possible to cover that area with 2x2 blocks starting from the 1s present above and to the left. The code will incorrectly determine that it can output operations when in reality it cannot form matrix A, as required.

The program also fails to handle cases correctly when multiple 2x2 submatrices are needed, but the given input does not allow the transformation due to the shape and distribution of 1s.

Therefore, because it can fail for certain input configurations, the program's correctness is false.
