The program provided checks for every 2x2 submatrix in the matrix A to determine if at least one cell in that submatrix is a `1`. If it finds any, it adds the operation (the top left corner of the submatrix) to the `ops` list. The output hints suggest that the function's behavior is primarily focused on counting how many times a `1` appears in the specified positions within the submatrices.

However, the problem description clearly states that the goal is to make matrix B equal to matrix A by using operations that replace elements of B to `1` only when there is a complete 2x2 block of `1`s in matrix A. If there is even a single `0` in any 2x2 block, that block cannot be modified to match `A`. 

The main issues with the code are:

1. **Incomplete Condition**: The logic to only add an operation to `ops` when at least one of the four positions in a 2x2 submatrix contains a `1` does not align with the requirement to make B equal to A. The correct condition should check for the presence of a complete 2x2 sub-block of `1`s in matrix A to append the operation. The code will incorrectly add an operation even if it canâ€™t actually perform it because one or more values in the submatrix are `0`.

2. **Possibility of `-1` Output**: The check for operations exceeding 2500 is not the right approach to determine if it is impossible to create an equal matrix B. The requirement should rather be to evaluate all 2x2 submatrices and only add operations if they correspond to a complete `1` filled block in the corresponding submatrix in matrix A.

3. **Example Cases**: 
   - For an input case of:
     ```
     3 3
     1 0 1
     1 0 1
     0 0 0
     ```
     The expected output should be `-1` since it's impossible to make B equal A. However, the provided code may not produce this correctly due to the flawed checking logic.

Given these identified issues, the program does not correctly implement the transformation from B to A for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
