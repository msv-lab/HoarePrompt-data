The code snippet provided is a `continue` statement, which causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop, immediately jumping to the next iteration. Since the values of variables are not affected in a manner that changes their state outside of the loop, the output state reflects the conditional context surrounding the use of `continue`.

Now analyzing the variables:
- The initial status of the variables `A`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `ops` remains unchanged by this statement.
- The variable `ops` contains the tuple (2, 1) if at least one of the specified conditions considering `A[0][0], A[1][0], A[0][1], or A[1][1]` is equal to 1.

Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state surrounding the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1; if at least one of `A[0][0], A[1][0], A[0][1], or A[1][1]` is equal to 1, then `ops` now contains the tuple (2, 1), and continue is executed.**
