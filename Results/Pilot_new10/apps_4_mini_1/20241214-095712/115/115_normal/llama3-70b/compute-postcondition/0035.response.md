According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to 1, and `m` is at least 2. This means that `m - 1` is at least 1, allowing for at least one more iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these changes. 

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and if at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, then `ops` contains the tuple (2, 2); if all four values are equal to 1, then `ops` contains the tuple (2, 1); if none of the cells contain 1, the program does not execute any further action.**
