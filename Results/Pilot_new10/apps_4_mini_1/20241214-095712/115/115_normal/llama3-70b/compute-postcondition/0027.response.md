Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and at least one of `A[0][0], A[1][0], A[0][1], or A[1][1]` is equal to 1. The current value of `A[i][j]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, meaning at least one of these elements is equal to 1.***
