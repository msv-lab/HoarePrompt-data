Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then no further action is executed. If at least one of these values is 1, then `ops` contains the tuple (2, 2); if all four values are equal to 1, `ops` contains the tuple (2, 1); if none of the cells contain 1, the program does not execute any further action.***
