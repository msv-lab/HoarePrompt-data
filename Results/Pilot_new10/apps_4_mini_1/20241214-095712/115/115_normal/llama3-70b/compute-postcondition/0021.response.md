Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `m - 2`, and `ops` contains tuples `(1, j + 1)` for every `j` from 0 to `m - 2` where at least one of `A[0][j]`, `A[1][j]`, `A[0][j + 1]`, or `A[1][j + 1]` is equal to 1; otherwise, if none of the elements across the relevant positions are 1, `ops` remains unchanged from its state prior to the loop execution.**
