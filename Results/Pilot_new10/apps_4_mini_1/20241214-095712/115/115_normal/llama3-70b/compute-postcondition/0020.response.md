Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If at least one of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, a new tuple (1, 3) is appended to `ops`. If all of these elements are 0, there is no action taken.***
