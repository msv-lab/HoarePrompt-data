The variable `ops` is expected to be a list where we will append a tuple. The appended tuple will be `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given that `i` is currently `0` and `j` is currently `2`, the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` will be `1` and `3`, respectively. 

Before running the operation, we do not need to change `A`, `n`, `m`, `i`, or `j` unless specified by conditions in the code. Since the code appends the calculated values to the `ops` list, we need to ensure that we note the result of that operation.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `ops` has a new tuple (1, 3) appended to it.**
