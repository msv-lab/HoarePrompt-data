Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `ops` contains tuples (2, j + 1) for each executed iteration where at least one of `A[0][0]`, `A[1][0]`, `A[0][1]`, or `A[1][1]` is equal to 1. If at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, then `ops` now contains an additional tuple (3, 1). Otherwise, there are no modifications to the variables or the structure of `A`.***
