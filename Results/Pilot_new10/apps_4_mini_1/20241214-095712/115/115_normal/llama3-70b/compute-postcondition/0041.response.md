According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue iterating as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. This means that after this iteration, `i` will become 2. For the loop to run again, `n` must be greater than 3 (since `n - 1` must be greater than `i`, which will be 2). 

Thus, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration are as follows:
- `A` remains unchanged (as it is a 2D list of integers).
- `n` remains at least 3.
- `m` remains at least 2.
- `i` is now 2.
- `j` remains as `m - 1` (assuming `m` stays the same).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` contains the tuples (2, j+1) for each executed iteration where at least one of `A[0][j]`, `A[1][j]`, `A[0][j + 1]`, or `A[1][j + 1]` is equal to 1.**
