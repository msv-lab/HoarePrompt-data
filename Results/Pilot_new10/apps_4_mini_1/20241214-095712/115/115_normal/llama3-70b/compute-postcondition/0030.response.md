According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `m` is at least 2, this means the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. For the loop to continue executing, `m` must still be at least 2, which it is, and `m - 1` must be at least 1, which it is (as `m` is at least 2).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1; if at least one of `A[0][0], A[1][0], A[0][1], or A[1][1]` is equal to 1, then `ops` now contains the tuple (2, 1).**
