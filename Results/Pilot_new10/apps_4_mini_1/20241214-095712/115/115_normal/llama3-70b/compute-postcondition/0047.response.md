Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` contains tuples (2, j + 1) for each executed iteration where at least one of `A[0][0]`, `A[1][0]`, `A[0][1]`, or `A[1][1]` is equal to 1; and at least one of the following conditions is true: `A[i][j]` is equal to 1, or `A[i + 1][j]` is equal to 1, or `A[i][j + 1]` is equal to 1, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1; `ops` also now contains an additional tuple (3, 1).**
