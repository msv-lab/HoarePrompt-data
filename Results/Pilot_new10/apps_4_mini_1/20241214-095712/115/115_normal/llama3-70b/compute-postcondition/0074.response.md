Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `A` of integers (0s and 1s) of size `n x m`. It checks for every 2x2 sub-square within `A` whether at least one of the four positions contains a 1. If the count of such positions (stored in `ops`) exceeds 2500, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the count of valid operations and the coordinates of each 2D pair where at least one position within the sub-square contains a 1. If there are no valid positions, it will print 0 and not print any coordinates.
