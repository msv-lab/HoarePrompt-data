Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `B` contains the updated values at positions `B[2][0]`, `B[2][1]`, `B[3][0]`, `B[3][1]`, if corresponding values in `A` were 1 for `j` in the range `m - 1`. The `operations` list contains all tuples (3, j+1) for each j where the condition in the loop was satisfied. If no conditions were met, `B` remains unchanged and `operations` remains empty.**
