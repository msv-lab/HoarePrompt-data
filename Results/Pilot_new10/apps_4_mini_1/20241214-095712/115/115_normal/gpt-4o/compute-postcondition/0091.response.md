The `print(op[0], op[1])` statement outputs the first two elements of the `op` list. The variable `op` is the fourth element in the `operations` list, which contains at least four transformations. This implies that `op` should have two elements available for printing.

The values of `B`, `operations`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged during this execution. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`B` contains positions indicating successful transformations; `operations` is a list that has at least 4 transformations; `n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; the first two elements of `op` have been printed.**
