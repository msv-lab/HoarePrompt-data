The code snippet assigns the value `1` to four elements of a 2D array `B`. The indices used for accessing the 2D array are based on the values of `i` and `j`. Initially, `i` is `1` and `j` is `1`, so the assignments are to the following elements:

1. `B[1][1]`
2. `B[1][1 + 1]` which is `B[1][2]`
3. `B[1 + 1][1]` which is `B[2][1]`
4. `B[1 + 1][1 + 1]` which is `B[2][2]`

Since the initial conditions state that `n` is at least `2` and `m` is greater than or equal to `3`, the 2D array `B` must have dimensions of at least `2 x 3` to accommodate these indices. The preconditions regarding `n` and `m` remain valid after this code is executed. 

The impacted variables are `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]`, which are now set to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `B[1][1]` = 1, `B[1][2]` = 1, `B[2][1]` = 1, `B[2][2]` = 1**
