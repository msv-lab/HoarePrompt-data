To determine the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information carefully. The loop is governed by the variable `j`, which is used in the `range(m - 1)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `m` is at least 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.

The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. Given that `m` is at least 2, `m - 1` is at least 1. This means the loop can execute when `j` is 0 (the current state).

At the end of the current iteration, if the loop executes again, `j` will be incremented by 1. Thus at the start of the next loop iteration, `j` would be 1.

To ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to consider whether the condition `j < m - 1` still holds true:
- Since `j` will become 1, and for the loop to execute again, it requires that `1 < m - 1`. Thus, this implies that `m` must be at least 3.

So, summarizing the state modifications needed for the next iteration:
- `n` remains at least 2.
- `m` must now be at least 3.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` will become 1.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
