Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0. If `A[1][0]` = 1, `A[1][1]` = 1, `A[2][0]` = 1, and `A[2][1]` = 1, then `B[1][0]` = 1, `B[1][1]` = 1, `B[2][0]` = 1, `B[2][1]` = 1, and `operations` now includes the tuple `(2, 1)`; otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the variables in the program.***
