Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, if all necessary conditions (A[i][j] == 1, A[i][j + 1] == 1, A[i + 1][j] == 1, A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1 for all applicable j in the range) are met then `B` will contain the corresponding entries set to 1 for each valid j, and `operations` will contain tuples (2, j + 1) for each valid j, otherwise `B` will remain unchanged with the same values as before and `operations` will only contain previously appended tuples if any.**
