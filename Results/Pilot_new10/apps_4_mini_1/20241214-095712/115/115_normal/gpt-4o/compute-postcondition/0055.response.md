Postcondition: ***`B` contains relevant positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` may be empty, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the value of `A[i][j]` is equal to the value of `B[i][j]`. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1; otherwise, no action is taken.***
