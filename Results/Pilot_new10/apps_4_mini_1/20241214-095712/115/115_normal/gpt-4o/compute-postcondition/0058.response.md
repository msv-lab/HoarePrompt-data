Postcondition: ***`B` contains relevant positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` may be empty, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the value of `A[i][j]` is equal to the value of `B[i][j]`. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, nothing is returned, and the equality of `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` is maintained.***
