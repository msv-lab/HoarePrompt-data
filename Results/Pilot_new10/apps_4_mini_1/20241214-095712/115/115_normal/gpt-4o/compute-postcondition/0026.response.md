Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. If `A[i][j]` = 1, `A[i][j + 1]` = 1, `A[i + 1][j]` = 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` = 1, then `B[1][1]` = 1, `B[1][2]` = 1, `B[2][1]` = 1, `B[2][2]` = 1, and the tuple (2, 2) is appended to `operations`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
