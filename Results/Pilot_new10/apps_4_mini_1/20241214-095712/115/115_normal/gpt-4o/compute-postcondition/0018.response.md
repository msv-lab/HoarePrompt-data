According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `m` is given to be greater than or equal to 2, it guarantees that `m - 1` is at least 1, allowing the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will range from 0 to `m - 2`. Since the initial value of `j` is given to be less than `m - 1`, this condition satisfies the requirement for the loop to run.

Thus, the state needs to ensure that the conditions for the loop execution are clear, specifically that `j` is initialized to 0 at the start of the for loop. However, since `j` is already less than `m - 1` and there are no changes needed for `n` or `i`, we can keep them as they are.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
