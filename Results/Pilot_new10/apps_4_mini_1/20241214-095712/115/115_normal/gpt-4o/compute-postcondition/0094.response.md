Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a list `A` containing `n` sublists each with `m` binary integers (0 or 1). It attempts to create a new list `B` where positions corresponding to 2x2 blocks of `1`s in `A` are set to `1`. The function returns -1 if there are discrepancies between `A` and `B` after the transformation, indicating that not all elements in `A` match those in `B` based on the transformation criteria. If transformations are successful, it prints the number of transformations and their 1-indexed positions without returning any other output. The function does not explicitly handle cases where no transformations occur, nor does it address any potential errors with empty or malformed input lists.**
