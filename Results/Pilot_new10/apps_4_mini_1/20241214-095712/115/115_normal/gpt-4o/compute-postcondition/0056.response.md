According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration of the loop to occur, `j` must be 2 and `m` must remain greater than 2.

State: **`B` contains relevant positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` may be empty, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the value of `A[i][j]` is equal to the value of `B[i][j]**.
