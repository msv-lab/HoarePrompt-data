The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Here is the breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program properly reads the dimensions of the matrices (`n` and `m`) and the matrix `A`. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Matrix Initialization**: Matrix `B` is initialized with all zeros, which is also consistent with the problem statement that matrix `B` initially contains all zeros.

3. **Operations Application**: The nested loops correctly iterate through potential `2x2` submatrices of `A`. Whenever the program finds a `2x2` submatrix (in `A`) filled with `1`s, it correctly updates the corresponding four positions in `B` to `1` and records the operation.

4. **Final Comparison**: After attempting to transform `B` to match `A`, the program checks each corresponding element of `A` and `B`. If any element does not match, it correctly returns `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to make `B` equivalent to `A`.

5. **Output of Operations**: If transformations have been successfully recorded (i.e., if `B` can be made equal to `A`), it prints the number of operations followed by the list of operations, which is in line with the expected output format.

6. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The program considers cases where no operations are needed (e.g., when `A` is entirely zeros by checking if `operations` is empty).
   - It correctly handles the boundaries of the matrices (i.e., it does not attempt to access elements outside the bounds of `A` when checking for `2x2` submatrices).

Given these points, the program successfully adheres to the problem's requirements and edge cases. Thus, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
