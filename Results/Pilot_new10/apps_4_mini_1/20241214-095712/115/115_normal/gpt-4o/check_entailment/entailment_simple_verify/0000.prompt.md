You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

Input
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

Output
-1

Input
3 2
0 0
0 0
0 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)

def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and (A[i + 1][j] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the logic in the program and consider edge cases or scenarios that might not be handled correctly.

The key points in the problem description are:
1. We need to transform a zero matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) by performing operations on \( B \).
2. Each operation involved replacing elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix of \( B \) with '1'.
3. We must check if it is possible to form \( A \) using a sequence of these operations and output either the number of operations and their details or -1 if it's impossible.

Key observations in the provided program:
- The function `func_1(n, m, A)` attempts to locate where we can perform the \( 2 \times 2 \) operations by checking the corresponding elements in \( A \).
- It only considers the situation where a \( 2 \times 2 \) block in \( A \) is completely filled with '1's before marking it in \( B \).
- The final step checks if \( B \) matches \( A \) and returns -1 if there is any discrepancy.

While this logic seems sound for specific cases, we have to consider edge cases where the formation of \( A \) might not be achievable solely through \( 2 \times 2 \) operations.

### Possible Counter Example:
Consider the following matrix \( A \):

```
3 3
1 0 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```

In this case:
- \( A[0][0] = 1\) allows us to perform the operation at cell \( (1, 1) \), which would change the matrix \( B \) to:
```
1 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```
- However, the operation at cell \( (1, 1) \) would set \( B[0][1] \) and \( B[1][0] \) to '1', which correctly reflects the construction being incomplete, as \( A[0][1] \) remains '0'.
- Ultimately, we arrive at a situation where part of matrix \( A \) can not be formed due to an unachievable single '1' that has a '0' adjacent in both rows and columns.

### Conclusion:
Thus, since the given program fails to account for specific configurations like the counterexample above, and these scenarios will lead the code to incorrect behavior by returning operations when it is not actually possible to achieve the intended matrix \( A \).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

        for j in range(m):

            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, and A is a list of n lists, each containing m integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.

    operations = []
    B = [([0] * m) for _ in range(n)]

                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `B` contains `1` at positions where the corresponding `2x2` submatrices in `A` were all `1`, `operations` contains tuples for each successful transformation, if any. If no transformations occur, `B` remains a list initialized to `0`, and `operations` remains empty.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `B` contains positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` reflects any transformations applied or is empty, `A[i][j]` equals `B[i][j]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1` and `j` from `0` to `m-1`, `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, and neither can be zero (both must be positive integers).
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `B` contains positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` is a list of transformations with length equal to the number of transformations applied, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, the first two elements of each `op` have been printed for each transformation in `operations`. If `operations` is empty, `B` remains unchanged and `operations` is an empty list.
