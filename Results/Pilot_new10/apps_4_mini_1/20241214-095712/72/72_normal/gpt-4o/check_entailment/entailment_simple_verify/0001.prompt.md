You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
Program:

Original Assessment: To determine whether the given Python program correctly fulfills the requirements set by the problem description, we need to analyze its logic, the calculations being performed, and assess whether there are any scenarios where the behavior can deviate from what is expected.

### Key Points from the Problem:
1. The teacher asks questions in a specific order based on a classroom setup (n rows, m pupils per row).
2. The counting of questions follows a zigzag pattern:
   - The first row is asked first, then the second, and so on, until the last row is reached. Direction then reverses.
3. The teacher asks a total of k questions, which complicates the understanding of how many times each pupil gets asked.
4. The program must output the maximum, minimum, and how many times Sergei is asked based on inputs x, y.

### Code Examination:
1. The function begins by adjusting indices (decreasing x and y by 1).
2. It calculates `full_cycle_length`, which represents the total number of questions asked in one complete cycle of asking all students.
3. It determines how many complete cycles occur in k questions and how many questions are remaining.
4. It initializes `min_questions` and `max_questions` to the number of full cycles.
5. The next part involves adjusting these counts based on the cycle's length and the specific row Sergei is in.
6. It then iterates through the remaining questions based on directional asking which could lead to potential flaws.

### Analyzing Edge Cases:
1. **Single Row Case**: 
   If n=1, the program sets `full_cycle_length` to m, which is expected. The program handles single row cases correctly by calculating Sergei's questions without switching directions.

2. **High k Values**: 
   Given k can be as high as 10^18, calculating everything based on loops (as done in `remaining_questions`) without optimization might be problematic. However, since any complete cycles dominate, this aspect seems correct as it correctly uses modulo calculations on cycles.

3. **Incorrect Assignment to `max_questions` and `min_questions`**:
   The program can miscalculate questions for pupils not in the edge rows when calculating questions based solely on `full_cycles`. The indexing logic for counting in the loop could potentially miss the last few questions for intermediate pupils in certain conditions.

4. **Example Input**: 
   For the input `4 2 9 4 2`, expected output is `2 1 1`. But analyzing through the complete zigzag pattern shows that questions may not be counted correctly especially with respect to pupils sitting in middle or upper rows due to how cycles are counted.

### Verdict:
The function presents logic that appears prone to error mainly in calculating minimum and maximum interactions of pupils by not thoroughly considering all edge cases. The looping mechanism to count remaining questions seems straightforward but could lead to incorrect results without more specific indexing control (especially when reversing directions).

Based on the above assessments, I have concluded:

Correctness: **False**

### Specific Case of Failure:
For input `2 2 5 1 1`, the expected count for max/min questions fails when handling row dynamics; the maximum should account cyclic requests dynamically altering per row if the full count is not accurately established navely through a single cyclic approach conflicting with reverse direction. Thus, incorrect results across various random checks indicate that the logic is flawed in cyclic calculations for maximal expectations and complex row structures undermining count stability.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the number of rows and the number of pupils in each row respectively, k is a positive integer representing the total number of questions asked, x is a positive integer indicating Sergei's row (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and y is a positive integer indicating Sergei's position in the row (1 ≤ y ≤ m).

Otherwise, `x` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` is decreased by 1, and `sergei_questions` is updated to `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`. In both cases, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is computed as `k % full_cycle_length`, and `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, while `max_questions` is updated to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`.
