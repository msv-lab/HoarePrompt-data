Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` has been decreased by `m`, `sergei_questions` has been increased by the count of occurrences where `(row == x and col == y)` across `m` iterations, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` has been updated based on the total increments and decrements during the loop executions, `col` is 0, and the current value of `row` is equal to `x` while `col` is equal to `y`.***
