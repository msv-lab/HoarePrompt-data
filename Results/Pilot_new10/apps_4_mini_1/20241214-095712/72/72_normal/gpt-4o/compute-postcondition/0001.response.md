The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Given that `x` is a positive integer before the operation, the new value of `x` will still be a positive integer after the decrement if `x` was originally greater than 1. If `x` was originally 1, it will become 0, which is not positive. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `y`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer if the previous value of `x` was greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is a positive integer.**
