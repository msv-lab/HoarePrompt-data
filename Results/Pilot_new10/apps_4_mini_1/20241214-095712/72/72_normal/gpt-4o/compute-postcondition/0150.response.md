Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` is the previous value decreased by `m`, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`. If `row` is equal to -1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `row` is updated to `row + 2`. The values of `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, and `min_questions` retain their previous values and constraints. If `row` is not equal to -1, all values remain unchanged.***
