The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of pupils in each row, `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of questions asked, `x` is a positive integer indicating Sergei's row (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and `y` is a positive integer indicating Sergei's position in the row (1 ≤ y ≤ m). 

Based on the execution of the function:
- If certain conditions related to the parameters are met, values may be calculated to determine how many questions Sergei must answer based on his position and row.
- The function will output a specific result based on these calculations, which may involve how many questions he can potentially answer or any restrictions that may apply based on his row or position.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of rows), m (pupils in each row), k (total questions), x (Sergei's row), and y (Sergei's position), performing calculations to determine the number of questions Sergei must answer based on his position and row.**
