Output State: **`direction` is -1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than `full_cycle_length`, if `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, then `sergei_questions` is updated appropriately (incremented by 1), `y` is decreased by `m`, `full_cycle_length` remains equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` is increased by 1; `row` is now equal to `row - 1`.**
