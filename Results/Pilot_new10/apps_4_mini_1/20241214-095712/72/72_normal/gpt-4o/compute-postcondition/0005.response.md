The code computes the value of `remaining_questions` as the remainder of `k` divided by `full_cycle_length`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this calculation. 

Given that `full_cycle_length` is dependent on the values of `n` and `m`, and knowing that `full_cycles` is based on the division of `k` by `full_cycle_length`, we conclude that `remaining_questions` must hold a value that is bounded by `k` and `full_cycle_length`.

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer if x was greater than 1 otherwise 0, `y` is a positive integer equal to `y - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 else m`, `full_cycles` is an integer value equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, and `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer if x was greater than 1 otherwise 0, `y` is a positive integer equal to `y - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 else m`, `full_cycles` is an integer value equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`.**
