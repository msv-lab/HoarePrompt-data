Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to either the previous value if it was greater than 1 or 0, `y` is a positive integer equal to `y - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is an integer value equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`, and `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.***
