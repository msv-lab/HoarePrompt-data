Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, and `y` has been decreased by `m`. If `direction` is equal to 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, and `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`. Additionally, `max_questions` is increased by 1, if `row` is equal to `n`, then `direction` is set to -1 and `row` is updated to `n - 3`, where previously `row` was `n - 1`. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `full_cycle_length` remains equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` has been decreased by 1, and `row` is now 1 with `direction` now set to 1.***
