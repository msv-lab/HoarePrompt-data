The variable `y` is decremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `y` is a positive integer, so after the decrement, `y` will still be a positive integer, specifically `y - 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer if the previous value of `x` was greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is a positive integer equal to `y - 1`.**
