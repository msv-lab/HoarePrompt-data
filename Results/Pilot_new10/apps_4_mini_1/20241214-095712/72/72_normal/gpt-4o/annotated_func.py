#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five integer parameters: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of pupils in each row), `k` (total number of questions asked), `x` (Sergei's row), and `y` (Sergei's position in the row). It calculates the total number of questions Sergei must answer based on his position and the cycling of rows, considering special cases for the edge rows and whether the number of questions exceeds one full cycle of rows. The function outputs the maximum and minimum questions Sergei can answer as well as the exact number of questions he must answer based on the remaining questions, without checking for invalid input scenarios (such as ensuring `x` and `y` are within the valid range).
