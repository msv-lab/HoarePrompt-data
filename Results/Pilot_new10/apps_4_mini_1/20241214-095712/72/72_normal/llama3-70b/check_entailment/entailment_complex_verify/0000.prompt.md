You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. The teacher asks questions in a zigzag manner through the rows of students.
2. We need to derive three values:
   - Maximum number of questions asked to any pupil.
   - Minimum number of questions asked to any pupil.
   - Number of times Sergei is asked.

### Program Analysis:
The provided function computes the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's asked counts using the following logic:
- `max_asked`: Calculates how many full cycles of asking all pupils (2n) can fit into `k`, adjusting for any remainder.
- `min_asked`: Computes the minimum number of questions asked to any pupil, ensuring that it is at least 1.
- `sergei_asked`: Calculates how many times Sergei was likely asked based on his position.

### Potential Cases to Verify:
1. **Single Row, Multiple Questions (1 3 8 1 1)**:
   - Each pupil is asked in sequence continuously, resulting in the expected output of **3 2 3**.
   
2. **Multiple Rows, Sergei at Last Row (4 2 9 4 2)**:
   - Verifying whether the zigzag logic and how indices translate lead to the expected counts. Expected output is **2 1 1**. 

3. **Large Inputs Edge Cases (100 100 1000000000000000000 100 100)**:
   - This is a significant test to see if large numbers are handled correctly. The expected calculations need to be robust without overflow issues while ensuring that Sergei's position is evaluated correctly. Expected output is **101010101010101 50505050505051 50505050505051**.

### Validation of Logic:
- For `max_asked`, since each pupil can get asked a max of one question per full cycle, it accounts for complete cycles and the remainder correctly.
- For `min_asked`, the logic ensures that it cannot be less than 1, which matches the description.
- The calculation for `sergei_asked` uses his position and handles sequences of questioning, including full cycles and remainders, which seems correct based on the provided logic.

### Potential Missing Logic and Concerns:
The function seems to line up with the task at hand, however:
1. **Ensuring Coverage of All Seats**:
   - According to the input constraints, querying rows and seats should respect all student indices including edge cases where `k` is less than the total seats, thus not all pupils get asked in the scenario where `k` is not a multiple of the total rows and students.

2. **Edge Cases with Direct Indices**:
   - Testing the function with `n = 1`, `m = 1`, and any `k` (like `k = 1`, `k = 2`, etc.) should still yield straightforward outputs. However, confirmation with actual output is required.

### Conclusion:
The program does seem to operate correctly given reasonable input bounds, and it's validated against provided examples. Still, we need definite testing. However, since I cannot provide a specific counterexample without running the code, let's phrase the result accordingly.

Correctness: **False**.

### Notable Counterexample:
For very large `k`, combined with indices particularly near `1` or `n`, can yield incorrect distributions causing Sergei count deviation not covered in absence of check loops through the questioning rounds—indicating that the distribution heuristics may not hold strong against extreme cases without evident summation logic verification.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the number of rows and seats respectively, k is a positive integer representing the total number of questions asked, and x and y are integers representing Sergei's position in the seating arrangement such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ y ≤ m.
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five integer parameters: n (number of rows), m (number of seats), k (total questions asked), x (Sergei's row position), and y (Sergei's seat position). It computes and prints three values: the maximum number of questions asked by any student, the minimum number of questions that could have been asked by a student, and the number of questions Sergei is estimated to have asked based on his position.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
