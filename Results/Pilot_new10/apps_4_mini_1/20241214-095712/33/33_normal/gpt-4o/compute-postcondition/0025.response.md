Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If `dir` is 'North', then `position` is -1 and `valid` is False while `t` remains 1. If `dir` is 'South', `position` is set to 1, `valid` is False, `t` remains 1, and the combined value of `position` and `t` is greater than 20000. Otherwise, if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False, `t` remains 1, and `dir` is an input value of 2. The current value of `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000.***
