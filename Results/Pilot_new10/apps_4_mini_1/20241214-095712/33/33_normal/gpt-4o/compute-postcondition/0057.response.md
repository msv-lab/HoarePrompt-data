Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `valid` remains False. If `dir` is 'North', then `position` is updated to a negative value (equal to the previous `position` - `t`). If `dir` is 'South', then if `position + t` does not exceed 20000, `position` is updated to `position + t`; otherwise, `position` remains unchanged. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', the program state remains unchanged if `position` is 0 or 20000; otherwise, the state also remains unchanged.***
