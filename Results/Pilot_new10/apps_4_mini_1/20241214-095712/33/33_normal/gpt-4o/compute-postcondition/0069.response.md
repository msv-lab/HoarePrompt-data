The function `func` does not accept any parameters; it operates without input. After executing the function, it processes a journey consisting of a positive integer `n`, which indicates the number of parts in the journey. For each part, it takes `t_i` as the distance (a positive integer) and `dir_i` as the direction (a string that can be "North", "South", "West", or "East"). Based on the processing of these journey components, the function returns the final position after the journey is completed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a journey with a number of parts represented by a positive integer and distances and directions for each part, and returns the final position after executing the journey.**
