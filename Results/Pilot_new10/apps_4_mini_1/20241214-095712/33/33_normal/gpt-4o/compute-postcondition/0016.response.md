The value of `position` is incremented by `t`, which is 1. Since the initial value of `position` is 0, the new value of `position` will be 0 + 1 = 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `position` is 1, `valid` is False, `t` is 1, `dir` is 'South', and the combined value of `position` and `t` is greater than 20000. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `position` is 1, `valid` is False, `t` is 1, `dir` is 'South', and the combined value of `position` and `t` is greater than 20000.**
