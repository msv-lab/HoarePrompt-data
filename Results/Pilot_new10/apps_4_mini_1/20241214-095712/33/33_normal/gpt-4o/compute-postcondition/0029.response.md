The values of `t` and `dir` will be assigned based on the input received by `input().split()`. Since the values of `t` and `dir` are not defined previously, they will be set to whatever input is provided. `n`, `position`, and `valid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `position` is either 0 or 20000; `valid` is set to False; `t` is the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input.**
