The code `print('NO')` will output the string 'NO'. However, the given conditions indicate that if `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' would be printed and the program exits, but in this scenario, `curr_lat` is equal to -90, which is within the valid latitude range. As `curr_lat` is valid, the program continues and 'NO' is printed.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of all other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `dir` can be either 'North', 'South', or neither; `curr_lat` is equal to -90; 'NO' has been printed.**
