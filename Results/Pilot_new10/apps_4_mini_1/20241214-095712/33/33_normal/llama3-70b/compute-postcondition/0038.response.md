The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the execution of the program. Hence, no variables are changed because the program stops running. The variables `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain in their previous state, and the program has printed 'NO' before exiting.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer from user input; `dir` is a value from user input; `curr_lat` remains unchanged; 'NO' has been printed and program execution has terminated.**
