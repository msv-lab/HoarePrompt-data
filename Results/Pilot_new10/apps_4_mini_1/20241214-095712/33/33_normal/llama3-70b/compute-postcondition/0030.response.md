To evaluate the code snippet `curr_lat -= t / 111.195`, we need to understand the changes it makes based on the initial state. 

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50
- `t` is an integer from user input (let's denote the input value as `input_t`)
- `dir` is a value from user input (let's denote the input value as `input_dir`)
- `curr_lat` is assumed to have some initial value (let's denote it as `initial_curr_lat`)

The code will perform the operation on `curr_lat` by subtracting `t / 111.195` from its current value. 

Let’s denote:
- `curr_lat`'s initial value as `initial_curr_lat`.
- A new value `t_value` is derived from `t` which is `input_t`.

Therefore, the new value for `curr_lat` will become: 
`curr_lat = initial_curr_lat - (input_t / 111.195)`

Since we assume the initial value of `curr_lat` is still unknown, we retain that information in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer from user input; `dir` is a value from user input; `curr_lat` is updated to `initial_curr_lat - (t / 111.195)`**
