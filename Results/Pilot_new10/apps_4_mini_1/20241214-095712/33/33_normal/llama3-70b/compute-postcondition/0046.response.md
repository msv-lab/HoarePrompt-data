The value of `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. The initial state indicates that `n` is between 1 and 50, `t` is an integer, `dir` comes from user input, and `curr_lat` remains unchanged except for this update.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a value from user input, `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`.**
