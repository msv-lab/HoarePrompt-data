The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the input value of `t` from a string (as typically received from user input) to an integer. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The state of `t` is now an integer. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer from user input; `dir` is a value from user input.**
