The variable `curr_lat` is updated by adding the value of `t / 111.195` to its current value. The initial value of `curr_lat` is 90, and since `t` is an integer, the result of `t / 111.195` will be a float that represents latitude change based on `t` units of distance. The direction `dir` remains 'North', and the bounds on `n` are unchanged. 

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `curr_lat` while retaining all other variable information.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90 + (t / 111.195), `t` is an integer, and the direction `dir` is 'North'.**
