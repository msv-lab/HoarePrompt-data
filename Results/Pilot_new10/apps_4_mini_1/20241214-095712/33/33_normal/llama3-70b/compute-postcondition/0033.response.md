Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer from user input; `dir` is a value from user input. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is updated to `initial_curr_lat - (t / 111.195)`. For any other value of `dir`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
