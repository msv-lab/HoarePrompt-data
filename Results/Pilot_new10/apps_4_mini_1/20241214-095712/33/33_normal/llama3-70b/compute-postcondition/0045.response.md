The value of `t` is now assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the user input `t` into an integer. The variable `t` may have been a string from the input but is now an integer, and its specific value is not known. The other variables `n`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a value from user input, `curr_lat` remains unchanged**.
