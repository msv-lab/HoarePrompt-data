Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Latitude Calculation**: The program uses the conversion `curr_lat += t / 111.195` and `curr_lat -= t / 111.195` to update the current latitude (`curr_lat`). However, the problem states that Limak travels using direct kilometer measurements, rather than relying on latitude degrees. Since the Earth's circumference is given as 40,000 kilometers, moving 10,000 kilometers in the South direction would move him from the North Pole to a latitude of 30 degrees South directly, not through degrees. The conversion factor is unnecessary for the problem, as there is a clear kilometer-to-kilometer mapping.

2. **Movement Rules**: The handling of directional commands:
   - The program ignores movements in the "West" and "East" directions (`continue` statement). However, the problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle such movements. Although these movements do not affect latitude directly, ignoring them may not be aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - Additionally, the program allows for movement at the poles (both North Pole and South Pole), which contradicts the conditions laid out in the problem description. For example, from the North Pole, Limak should not be allowed to move "West" or "East", and at the South Pole, he should not move in any direction other than "North".

3. **Final Position Check**: The program checks if `curr_lat == 90` at the end, which is meant to confirm that Limak ends at the North Pole. However, due to the erroneous latitude calculations and the allowed movement rules described above, it does not guarantee that Limak ends in the correct position based on the defined rules.

Given these points, the program does not fulfill all the requirements outlined in the problem description, thus it is not correct.
