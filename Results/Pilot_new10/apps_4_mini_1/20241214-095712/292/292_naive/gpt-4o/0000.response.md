Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly simulates the yearly weight increases for Limak and Bob:

1. It starts with the initial weights of Limak and Bob and checks if Limak's weight is still less than or equal to Bob's weight.
2. If Limak's weight is not greater than Bob's, it updates their weights after each year (tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight).
3. The loop continues until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's weight, incrementing a year counter each iteration.
4. Once Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's, the program outputs the number of years that have passed.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program handles the potential cases correctly. It accounts for all scenarios outlined in the problem statement and effectively determines after how many full years Limak's weight will become strictly larger than Bob's.

Thus, there are no edge cases or scenarios where the code does not work as expected, making the program correct.
