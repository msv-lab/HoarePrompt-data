To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Requirements Recap:
1. Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`.
2. Limak's weight triples every year, while Bob's weight doubles.
3. We need to determine how many full years it will take for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code essentially reads the weights of Limak and Bob and simulates their weight growth over the years using a while loop until Limak's weight is greater than Bob's:

```python
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)
```

#### Key Points of Code:
- The code starts by reading the weights.
- It initializes a `years` counter.
- A while loop runs as long as Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`:
  - Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`).
  - Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).
  - The `years` counter is incremented each iteration.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Let’s consider the given edge cases based on the inputs from the problem description:

1. **Input**: `4 7`
   - Year 1: Limak = 12, Bob = 14  (Not larger)
   - Year 2: Limak = 36, Bob = 28 (Larger)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `4 9`
   - Year 1: Limak = 12, Bob = 18 (Not larger)
   - Year 2: Limak = 36, Bob = 36 (Not larger)
   - Year 3: Limak = 108, Bob = 72 (Larger)
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `1 1`
   - Year 1: Limak = 3, Bob = 2 (Larger)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The implementation correctly handles the cases where Limak needs to become strictly heavier than Bob by appropriately computing both weights based on the given rules. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program should execute within reasonable bounds without missing any case.

### Verdict:
Since the program works correctly for all tested provided examples, there are no apparent flaws in the logic. 

Correctness: **True**
