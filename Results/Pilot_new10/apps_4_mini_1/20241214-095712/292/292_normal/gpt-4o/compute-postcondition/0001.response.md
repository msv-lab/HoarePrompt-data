The code assigns `0` to the variable `years`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged and still adhere to the constraints provided (1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10). Therefore, the output state reflects that `years` is now `0`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10; `years` is 0**
