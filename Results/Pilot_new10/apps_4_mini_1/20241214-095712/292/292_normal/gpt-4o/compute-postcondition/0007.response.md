`a` is multiplied by 3. Since `a` is in the range [3, 30], the resulting value of `a` will be in the range [9, 90]. The values of `b` and `years` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `a`, and the unchanged values of `b` and `years`.

Output State: **`a` is in the range [9, 90]; `b` must be at least 3; `years` is 1**
