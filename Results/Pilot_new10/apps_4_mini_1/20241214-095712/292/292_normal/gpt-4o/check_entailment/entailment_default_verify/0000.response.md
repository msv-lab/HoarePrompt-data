Final: **True** 

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the number of years it will take for Limak's weight (which is tripled each year) to exceed Bob's weight (which is doubled each year). The program starts from the correct initial conditions and uses a loop to simulate the passage of years, tracking the weights as specified in the problem description. 

The output hint provided further supports this by summarizing the functionality of the program accurately, confirming that the logic and outputs are aligned with the requirements outlined in the problem statement. Since the program functions correctly within the established constraints and meets the problem's specifications without edge cases undermining its validity, the final conclusion remains that the program is indeed correct.
