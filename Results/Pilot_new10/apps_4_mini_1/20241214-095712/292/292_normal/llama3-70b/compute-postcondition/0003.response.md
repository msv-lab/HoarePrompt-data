`a` is multiplied by 3. The value of `a` can initially be between 1 and 10, so after this operation, `a` will be between 3 and 30. The value of `b` remains unchanged and is still between 1 and 10. The value of `years` is also unaffected and remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is now between 3 and 30, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10, and `years` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is between 3 and 30, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10, `years` is 0**
