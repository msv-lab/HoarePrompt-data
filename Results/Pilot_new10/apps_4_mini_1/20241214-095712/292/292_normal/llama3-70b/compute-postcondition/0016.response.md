The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers that satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, where `a` represents Limak's weight and `b` represents Bob's weight. After executing the function body, it processes these weights according to predefined logic. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept two integers `a` and `b` representing Limak's and Bob's weights respectively, and return results based on these weight values while ensuring that the constraints on their values are met.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (with 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), representing the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively.**
