`b` is updated by multiplying its current value by 2. The value of `b` was initially between 2 and 20, so after the operation, `b` will be between 4 and 40. The values of `a` and `years` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is between 9 and 60, `b` is between 4 and 40, `years` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is between 9 and 60, `b` is between 4 and 40, `years` is 1**
