`years` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `years` is 1, it now becomes 2. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is between 9 and 60, `b` is between 4 and 40, `years` is now 2.

Output State: **`a` is between 9 and 60, `b` is between 4 and 40, `years` is 2**.
