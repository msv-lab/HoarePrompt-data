The variable `years` is initialized to 0, but there are no previous values of `years` to consider because it was not defined before this point. The values of `a` and `b` are still valid as input integers between 1 and 10, inclusive. Therefore, the output state will remain unchanged for `a` and `b`, while `years` will now be defined as 0.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10, `years` is 0**
