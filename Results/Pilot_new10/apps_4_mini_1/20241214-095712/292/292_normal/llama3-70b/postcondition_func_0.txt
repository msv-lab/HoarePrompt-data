The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, representing the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. It calculates the number of years it takes for Limak's weight, which triples each year, to exceed Bob's weight, which doubles each year, and prints this number of years. The function does not return a value but directly prints the result.
