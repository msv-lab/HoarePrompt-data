The given program takes two integers `a` and `b`, representing the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively, and calculates how many years it will take for Limak to exceed Bob's weight based on their respective growth rates (Limak's weight triples each year, while Bob's weight doubles each year).

Upon closer inspection, the implementation correctly follows the logic of the problem description. The while loop continues executing as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight. In each iteration, Limak's weight is tripled, and Bob's weight is doubled, simulating the weight changes for each year. The variable `years` is incremented to keep track of how many iterations (years) have occurred until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.

Considering the provided examples:

1. For the input `4 7`:
   - Year 1: Limak = 12, Bob = 14 (4 * 3, 7 * 2) → Limak not greater yet.
   - Year 2: Limak = 36, Bob = 28 → Limak is greater (Output: 2).
   
2. For the input `4 9`:
   - Year 1: Limak = 12, Bob = 18 → Limak not greater yet.
   - Year 2: Limak = 36, Bob = 36 → Limak not greater yet (equal weights).
   - Year 3: Limak = 108, Bob = 72 → Limak is greater (Output: 3).
   
3. For the input `1 1`:
   - Year 1: Limak = 3, Bob = 2 → Limak is greater (Output: 1).

All potential cases have been accounted for in the logic, including the edge case where both weights start equal.

The output hints correctly summarize the functionality of the program, stating that it calculates the years correctly under the specified conditions.

Therefore, the program successfully meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
