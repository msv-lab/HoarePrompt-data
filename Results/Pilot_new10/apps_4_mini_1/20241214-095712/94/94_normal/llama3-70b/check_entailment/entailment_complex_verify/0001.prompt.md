You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
puzzle1 = [input() + input()]
puzzle2 = [input() + input()]
puzzle1 = ''.join(puzzle1).replace('\n', '')
puzzle2 = ''.join(puzzle2).replace('\n', '')
if func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
    (puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2]) = (puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1])
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly check if two sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration. The primary flaw lies in the function `func_1`, particularly in how it swaps tiles when an empty space is found.

When the function locates the empty tile ('X') in both puzzles, it incorrectly attempts to swap the characters at the found indices (`x1` and `x2`). However, this operation does not simulate the actual sliding moves required to reach a specific configuration, nor does it account for the necessary sequence of moves that would be needed from any given configuration. Sliding tiles is a restricted motion dictated by the adjacent positions, and simply sorting the grid afterward (using `sorted`) is not an adequate way to determine if both puzzles can arrive at the same configuration at all.

Consider the example:
```
Input:
AB
XC
AC
BX
```
In this case, Bessie's valid moves from `AB/XC` would be limited to the following:

1. Slide 'A' down: `XA/BC`
2. Slide 'C' up: `AC/XB`

Neither of these moves will lead Bessie to the configuration of Elsie's puzzle, thereby making it impossible for both puzzles to meet at the same configuration. 

A concrete case where the program fails to determine the relationship correctly is the above example, where it would incorrectly yield "YES" when the expected output is "NO". 

Thus, since the program fails to account for the sliding motion properly and yields incorrect results for certain inputs, it is deemed incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
puzzle1 = [input() + input()]
puzzle2 = [input() + input()]
puzzle1 = ''.join(puzzle1).replace('\n', '')
puzzle2 = ''.join(puzzle2).replace('\n', '')
if func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are strings consisting of two lines, each containing two characters where each character is either 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X', with exactly one 'X' in each puzzle indicating the empty cell.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are strings of two lines with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`; `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns False because the sorted characters of 'AABX' are not equal to the sorted characters of 'CCBB'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two strings `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each consisting of four characters ('A', 'B', 'C', and 'X') where 'X' represents an empty cell. It finds the indices of 'X' in both strings, swaps the characters at those positions, and returns `True` if the sorted characters of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` (after the swap) are equal; otherwise, it returns `False`. If the strings do not conform to the expected format (e.g., not containing exactly one 'X' each or having incorrect lengths), the function may not behave as intended, but this is not explicitly handled in the code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
