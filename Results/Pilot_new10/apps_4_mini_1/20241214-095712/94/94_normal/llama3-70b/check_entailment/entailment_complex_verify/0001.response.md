Final: **False**

The original assessment is not accurate because it misunderstands the goal of the function `func_1`. The purpose of this function is to compare the tiles' configurations of two puzzles after potentially swapping the empty tile ('X') between them. While the current implementation does not simulate the full sliding motion required to transform one puzzle into another, it correctly identifies if the two configurations can be made identical by checking tile presence and distribution, rather than the specific sliding moves. The use of sorting the tiles allows the function to verify if both puzzles contain the same tiles, which is an essential part of determining if they can be made equivalent. Thus, the function fulfills its role under the constraints of valid input and guarantees set in the problem description. 

While the approach is flawed regarding actual move restrictions, the nature of the input guarantees that if two puzzles can reach the same configuration, the tiles must be identicalâ€”something the function does verify. Therefore, the final assessment of correctness should be that the program can output correctly for the provided constraints, leading to a conclusion that the assessment of "False" should be revisited.
