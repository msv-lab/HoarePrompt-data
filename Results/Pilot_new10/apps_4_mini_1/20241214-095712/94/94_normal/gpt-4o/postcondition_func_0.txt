The function accepts a list `puzzle` containing exactly two strings, each of which consists of exactly two characters ('A', 'B', 'C', or 'X'). It returns the concatenation of these two strings. It assumes that the input is always a list of two valid strings, and does not handle cases where the input may not meet these specifications.
