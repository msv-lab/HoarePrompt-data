The variable `current` holds the value 'start', which is defined as a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X'. The `index` method is used to find the position of 'X' within the string `current`. 

1. `current` is equal to 'start', which means it contains 'X'.
2. The method `current.index('X')` is invoked to find the index of 'X' in this string.

The `index` function returns the position of the first occurrence of 'X'. Given that 'start' is structured with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', the index of 'X' is determined based on its position within 'start'.

Since we don't have the explicit string composition for `start`, we can only deduce that 'X' occupies one of the positions in the four-character string.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X'; `queue` is deque([]); `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'start'; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.**
