Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, and `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, it is added to `visited`, and `queue` contains at least 3 unique states, including `new_state_str`, with `current` as the first element in `queue`. If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, no changes are made to either `visited` or `queue`.***
