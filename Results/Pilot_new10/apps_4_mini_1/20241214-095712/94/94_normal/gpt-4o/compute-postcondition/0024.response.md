The value of `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which concatenates the elements of the `new_state` list into a single string. The prior state indicates that `current` has values swapped between `empty_pos` and `new_pos`, and `new_state` represents this new arrangement based on the swaps.

`new_state_str` will therefore be a string formed from the modified `new_state` list, which contains elements corresponding to the characters present in the original `current` but rearranged due to the swap. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation, but they contribute to the formation of `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc); `new_state` is a list with swapped values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining elements of `new_state`.**
