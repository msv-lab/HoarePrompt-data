To determine the necessary states for the `for` loop to execute, we must analyze the provided state information and the implications of the loop.

1. The loop iterates through `directions`, which are typically pairs of movements (for example, up, down, left, right). For the loop to execute, `directions` must contain at least one valid movement.

2. The variable `current` represents the state of the puzzle, and it should be defined before entering the loop. Since `current` is the first element removed from the `queue`, we must ensure that the `queue` has at least one state before the execution of the loop. This indicates that the `queue` must contain more than one unique state initially.

3. The variable `empty_pos` is the index of the character 'X' in the `current` state, which must be a valid index corresponding to the positions in the `start` state.

4. The `empty_row` and `empty_col` are derived from `empty_pos` and must be preset correctly for the logic inside the loop to work effectively.

Looking at these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute can be summarized as follows:

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` is a set containing all unique states created during the swapping process, including `start`; `queue` must contain at least one more unique state than `current`, thus `queue` must have at least 2 unique states; `current` is the first element in `queue`; `empty_pos` is a valid index (0-3) of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`.**
