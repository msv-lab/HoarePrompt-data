Output State: **`start` is the updated string after swapping characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`, `queue` is deque([]), `visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'start', `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is either 0 or 1, `empty_col` is either 0 or 1, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_state` is the list of characters from `current` post-swap, `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining elements of `new_state`, `new_state_str` has been added to `visited`.**
