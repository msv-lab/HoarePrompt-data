According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `queue` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `queue` is empty, which means there are no remaining unique states to process. For the loop to be executed one more time, at least one new state must be added to the `queue`. This requires modifying the states.

The current states are:
- `visited` includes all unique states created during the swapping process.
- `queue` is empty, meaning no states are left to process.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the situation such that `queue` contains at least one state. This might mean adding a state back into the `queue`.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` includes all unique states created during the swapping process; `queue` must contain at least one unique state**
