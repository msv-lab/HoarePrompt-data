Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and `queue`, reflecting the new state formed by swapping the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.***
