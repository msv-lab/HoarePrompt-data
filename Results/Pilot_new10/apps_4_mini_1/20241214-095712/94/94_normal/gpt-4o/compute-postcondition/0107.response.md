The operation essentially swaps the elements in the `new_state` list at the indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. Given that `new_state` is derived from `current`, the nature of its previous elements is unchanged, however, the swap will affect the position of its elements. 

1. `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped.
2. The positions of the characters within `new_state` are now altered, but the overall list still contains the same unique characters.

Now we define what the swap does:
- The element at index `empty_pos` is replaced with the element at `new_pos`, and vice versa.

Thus, the specific characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` will be swapped, but `new_state` will continue to reflect the characters from `current` altered by this swap. 

Since the initial state possesses no specific values for `empty_pos` or `new_pos`, we can only express the output generically.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `directions` must contain at least one more element; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; the characters at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state` are swapped.**
