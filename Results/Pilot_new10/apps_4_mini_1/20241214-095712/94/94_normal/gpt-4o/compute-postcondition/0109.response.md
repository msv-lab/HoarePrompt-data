The code adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set, which means the set now contains one additional unique string. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. `visited` must now include the new string created from `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `directions` must contain at least one more element; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.**
