Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` is a set containing all unique states created during the swapping process, including `start`; `queue` is a deque containing all unique states created that were added to `visited`, excluding any duplicates; `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the last state processed in the loop, which reflects the final swap operation; `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` correspond to the position of `X` after all possible valid moves have been processed; if no valid moves were possible, `queue` would remain empty and `visited` would only contain `start`.**
