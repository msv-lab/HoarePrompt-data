The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `start`. `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X', where 'X' represents an empty cell. After executing the function body, it returns a set containing all unique states generated through the swapping process, which includes at least the initial state `start`, and possibly other states if valid moves were made. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept a string `start` and return a set of unique states generated by swapping elements based on the constraints provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter start, which is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X', and returns a set of unique states generated through the swapping process.**
