The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which means `new_state` is a list containing the same elements as `current`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` is a set containing all unique states created during the swapping process, including `start`; `queue` contains at least 2 unique states; `current` is the first element in `queue`; `empty_pos` is a valid index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is valid; `new_col` is valid; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list containing the elements of `current`.
