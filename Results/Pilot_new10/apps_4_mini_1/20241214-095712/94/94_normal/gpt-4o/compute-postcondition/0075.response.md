Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; if `new_row` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and `new_col` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive), and `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state` is updated with swapped elements, `new_state_str` becomes the string representation of `new_state`, `visited` is updated to include `new_state_str`, and `queue` also includes `new_state_str`.***
