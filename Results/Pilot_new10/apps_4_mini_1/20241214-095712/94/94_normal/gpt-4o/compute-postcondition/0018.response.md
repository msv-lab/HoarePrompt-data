Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'. If `new_row` and `new_col` are within the valid range (0 to 1), `start` is updated after swapping characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. If the new state is not already in `visited`, `queue` is updated to contain `new_state_str`, and `visited` includes both `start` and `new_state_str`. The values of `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, and `new_col` remain updated accordingly. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
