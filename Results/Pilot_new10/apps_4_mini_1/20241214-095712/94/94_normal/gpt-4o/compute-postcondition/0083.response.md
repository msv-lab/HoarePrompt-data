Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` is a set of all unique states created during the swapping process; `queue` has at least one unique state; `current` is the leftmost state from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `directions` must have at least one direction; the values of `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the 2x2 grid (0 ≤ new_row < 2 and 0 ≤ new_col < 2).***
