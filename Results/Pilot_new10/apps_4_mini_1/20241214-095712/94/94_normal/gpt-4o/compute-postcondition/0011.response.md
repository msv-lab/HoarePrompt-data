The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of a list created from `current`, which is the string `start`. This means that `new_state` will be a list of characters derived from the string `start`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X'; `queue` is deque([]); `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'start'; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is either 0 or 1; `empty_col` is either 0 or 1; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list of characters from `current`.**
