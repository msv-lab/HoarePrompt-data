The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. This implies that `new_state_str` is now included in the `visited` collection. None of the other variables are directly affected by this command, but the state of the `visited` set changes to include one new element.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `directions` must contain at least one more element; `(dr, dc)` has been processed; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` is the list created from `current`, with elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`; `new_state_str` has been added to `visited`.**
