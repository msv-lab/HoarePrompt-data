The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which converts the `current` variable into a list form. The effect of this code snippet implies that `current` needs to have a valid string or iterable assigned to it, but the task does not specify its previous state. Therefore, we cannot detail its previous value. 

Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` is a list derived from `current`**.
