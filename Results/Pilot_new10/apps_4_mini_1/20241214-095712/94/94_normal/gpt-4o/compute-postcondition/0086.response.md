`new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are assigned the values of `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[empty_pos]` respectively, effectively swapping the characters in position `empty_pos` and `new_pos` within the `new_state` list. Since `current` was a string of length 4 with unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', and `empty_pos` indicates the position of 'X', `new_pos` refers to the new calculated position based on the direction moved.

The values of `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_state` will be impacted by this swap. However, without the exact values of `dr`, `dc`, or the contents of `queue`, we cannot ascertain the specific swap operation.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` is a set of all unique states created during the swapping process; `queue` has at least one unique state; `current` is the leftmost state from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_pos // 2 + dr) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2 + dc)`; `directions` has at least one direction; `new_state` now reflects the swap of characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
