According to the code, the for loop iterates over the `directions`, which implies that the loop will run for each direction (each pair of `dr` and `dc`). The iteration variable `dr, dc` will take the values from `directions`, and for each iteration, it processes those directions.

Since no changes are made to the `directions` collection itself during the body of the loop, the loop will execute a number of times equal to the length of `directions`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Current State**: The states of `start`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `queue`, and `visited` are relevant, but what we specifically need to focus on is the loop iterator (`dr`, `dc`), which will change to the next pair of values from the `directions` list for the next iteration.

Assuming `directions` has more than one element (which is necessary for the loop to execute again), after the current iteration, `dr` and `dc` will take the next values in the `directions` list according to its order. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions for `new_row` and `new_col` affecting `visited` and `queue` remain unchanged. However, the next values of `dr` and `dc` have to be considered for the next iteration.

Given that the loop can continue executing with valid `new_row`, `new_col` as before, the states should account for the next direction in `directions`.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `new_row` is between 0 and 1 inclusive, `new_col` is between 0 and 1 inclusive; `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `queue` must have at least one unique state, `current` remains the leftmost state from `queue`, `dr` is the next value from `directions`, and `dc` is the next value from `directions`.**
