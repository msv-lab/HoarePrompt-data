The code adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. The initial state indicates that `visited` was unchanged prior to this operation, so its previous content remains intact and only `new_state_str` is added to it. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `queue` contains at least 3 unique states including `new_state_str`; `directions` has at least one more pair to process; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is created by joining the characters of `new_state`.**
