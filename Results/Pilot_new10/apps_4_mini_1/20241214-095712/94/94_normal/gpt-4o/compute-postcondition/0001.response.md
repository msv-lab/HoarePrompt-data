The code `visited = set([start])` assigns a new set containing the variable `start` to `visited`. Since `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X', `visited` will now hold that string as a single element in a set. The `queue` remains unaffected. 

Therefore, the output state takes into account that `visited` is now a set containing the value of `start`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X'; `queue` is deque(['start']); `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.**
