Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique states generated during the swapping process; `queue` contains all unique states that were added and is empty if no unique states were generated; `current` is the last state that was processed before the loop ended; `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` are updated accordingly based on the final state of `current` with respect to the last valid moves made. If the loop did not execute, `visited` remains unchanged, `queue` would be unchanged, and `current` retains its initial value.**
