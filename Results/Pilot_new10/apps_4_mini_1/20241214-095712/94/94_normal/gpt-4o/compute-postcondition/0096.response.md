The variable `new_state` is assigned a list created from `current`. The value of `current` is defined as the leftmost state from `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged, but the state of `new_state` now consists of the individual characters of the `current` string, effectively making it a list of characters. Since `current` is derived from `queue`, it will hold the characters of whatever string `current` was assigned at that time.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `queue` must have at least one unique state; `current` remains the leftmost state from `queue`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` is a list of characters from `current`.**
