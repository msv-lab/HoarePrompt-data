Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. If `new_row` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and `new_col` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive), if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `visited` includes `new_state_str` and `queue` now includes `new_state_str`; if `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, no changes are made to `visited` or `queue`.***
