You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the intended logic based on the task description.

**Problem Breakdown:**
- Polycarp can complete subtasks that take a specified time and will be awarded points based on the number of subtasks completed and additional points if a whole task is completed.
- Given that multiple tasks (n) can incorporate the same subtasks (k), and a total time limit (M) restricts how many subtasks can be completed, the program should find the maximum points possible within that time.

**Review of the Program:**
- The program reads input values for the number of tasks (n), number of subtasks (k), and maximum available time (M).
- It sorts the time required for subtasks and sets up a dynamic programming table (`dp`) initialized for tracking the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed for each minute up to M.
- The nested loop fills up this `dp` table to calculate the total maximum points possible based on the time spent on subtasks.
- Finally, it sums up the points considering the complete tasks and subtasks solved.

**Potential Edge Cases to Consider:**
1. If M is 0, Polycarp can't solve any tasks, thus earning 0 points. The program should output 0.
2. If the subtasks require more time than M, no task can be completed; hence the expected output should also be 0.
3. Various values of n could mean even if some points are earned, the task limit should not exceed n.
4. If all subtasks take the same time but exceed M when summing for complete tasks, the calculation may return incorrect totals as per points per task solution.

After analyzing the program, I determined that:
- The loop structure only calculates possible points based on individual subtasks without adherence to the broader `n` scoped tasks.
- The summation at the end does not adequately consider how many tasks are completed based on the constraints of `n`, potentially counting more tasks than feasible.

Given these insights, I concluded that there are cases where the program does not work as required by the problem statement, particularly when M is constrained relative to the required times, leading to incorrect summation of potential earned points.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), M is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and t is a list of k integers (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000), where t[j] represents the time required to solve the j-th subtask.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input; `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum value of items that can be selected with the given integers within the weight limit `M`, considering all combinations of the integers in `t`. If `M` is 0, all values in `dp` remain 0 since no items can be selected.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
