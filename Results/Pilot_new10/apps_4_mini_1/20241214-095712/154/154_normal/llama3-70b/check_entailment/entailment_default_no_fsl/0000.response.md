Correctness: **False**

The provided program is not correct as it does not accurately compute the maximum points Polycarp can earn according to the problem requirements. 

The key issues are as follows:

1. **Dynamic Programming Logic Flaw**: The dynamic programming array `dp[i][j]` is meant to represent the maximum number of subtasks (points) Polycarp can achieve with `j` minutes by considering up to `i` subtasks. However, it only accounts for earning points by completing subtasks rather than also considering the bonus point for fully completing tasks.

2. **Counting Bonus Points**: In the output computation, the program applies an incorrect counting mechanism to determine if an additional point should be added for completing an entire task. The criterion used (`dp[i][M] == i`) does not line up accurately with the logic for checking whether a complete task has been solved.

3. **Lack of Total Task Integration**: The program needs to consider how many complete tasks (i.e., all `k` subtasks) can be completed within `M` minutes. It should also take into account the remaining time for additional subtasks after finishing as many whole tasks as possible.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**: While the program hints at handling edge cases where `M` equals 0 or other limiting values, it does not include sufficient checks to ascertain whether it is possible to complete any subtasks or how to optimally distribute the tasks under time constraints.

For example, consider if `n = 1`, `k = 4`, and `M = 3` with a `t` list of `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The correct output should be `1` (completing one subtask of the only task available), but the program might not return the expected result due to not properly considering the constraints.

Thus, due to these critical flaws, the implementation is not correct.
