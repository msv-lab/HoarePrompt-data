You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum points Polycarp can earn. It appears to focus only on the subtasks completed and adds points incorrectly.

### Issues identified:
1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: The DP array `dp[i][j]` is intended to store the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed in `j` minutes using `i` different subtasks. However, it does not account correctly for the tasks themselves and the additional point gained from fully completing each task.

2. **Counting Completed Tasks**: The program attempts to calculate the total points by simply adding the number of subtasks completed and an additional point for each fully completed task. However, it does not keep track of how many full tasks have been completed based on the time used.

3. **Implementation Mistake**: The way it sums up the points does not adhere to the requirement of maximizing the points overall. For each task's set of subtasks, if time permits, Polycarp should aim to complete tasks fully first before attempting to get additional subtasks in other tasks.

### Test Case Example where the code fails:
Let's consider the input:
``` 
2 3 10
2 2 2
```
According to the logic:
- Polycarp can complete one complete task (which costs 6 minutes) and have 4 minutes left, which allows him to complete one more subtask from the next task.
- He should earn: `3 (for completed task 1) + 1 (extra point for completing task 1) + 1 (for one completed subtask of task 2) = 5 points`.

According to the faulty program logic, the output will not correctly compute the maximum points due to mishandling of task completions and additional point calculation. Thus it fails to satisfy the problem requirements in specific instances like these. 

Because the program does not return the correct points earned under scenarios like this, it does not fully satisfy the problem conditions and is therefore considered incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts three parameters: integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), and `M` (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and a list `t` of `k` integers (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1,000,000). It calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be accomplished within the time limit `M` using dynamic programming. The final result displayed is the total number of those maximum subtasks plus 1 for each task if the task count at `M` matches the index. This includes edge cases where M is 0 or the list t might contain values which make it impossible to complete any subtasks. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
