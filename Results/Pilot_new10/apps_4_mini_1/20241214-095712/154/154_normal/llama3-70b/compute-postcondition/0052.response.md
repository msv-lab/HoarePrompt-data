Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), and `M` (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and a list `t` of `k` integers (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1,000,000). It calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be accomplished within the time limit `M` using dynamic programming. The final result displayed is the total number of those maximum subtasks plus 1 for each task if the task count at `M` matches the index. This includes edge cases where M is 0 or the list t might contain values which make it impossible to complete any subtasks. **
