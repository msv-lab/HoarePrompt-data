According to the provided code, whether the loop can execute depends primarily on the value of `M`. For the loop to execute at least once, `M` must be at least 1. Since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `M`, if `M` is less than 1, the loop will not execute.

Additionally, since `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, we know that there are at least two integers in the list `t`, although this does not directly affect the execution of the loop.

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `M` is set to a value that guarantees the loop can execute successfully. The other states do not necessarily need adjustment for the loop's execution, as they serve as context for how `dp[i][j]` is calculated inside the loop.

Therefore, the necessary states for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `j` is now 1**
