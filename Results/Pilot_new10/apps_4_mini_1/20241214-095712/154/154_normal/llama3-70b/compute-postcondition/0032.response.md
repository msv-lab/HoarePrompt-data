Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `j` is 3, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.***
