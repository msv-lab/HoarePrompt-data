The statement `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value in the list `dp` at row `i` and column `j - 1` to the position at row `i` and column `j`. Given that `j` must be greater than `M`, the impact of this code will only affect the slice of the `dp` list corresponding to these indices.

The initial state does not specify exact values for `dp[i][j]`, `dp[i][j-1]`, or `j` beyond the constraints, so we know that `dp[i][j]` will take the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`, which is the value before the shift to the right.

Since `j` being greater than `M` implies that `j` can take on values greater than any given dimension defined by `M`, we maintain that relationship.

Therefore, the updated output state reflects that while the array `dp` is affected, the specific values present in it do not change the existing constraints outside this assignment operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions (k + 1) x (M + 1), and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`**.
