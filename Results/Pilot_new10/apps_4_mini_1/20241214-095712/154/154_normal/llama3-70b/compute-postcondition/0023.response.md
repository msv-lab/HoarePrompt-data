The line of code `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` computes a new value for `dp[i][j]`. 

1. `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and a new value calculated as `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 
2. This implies that the new value of `dp[i][j]` could potentially be increased by 1 compared to the value from `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.
3. Other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `j` is currently 1; `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` based on the previous state.**
