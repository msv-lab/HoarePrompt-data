The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `t` is a list of `k` integers, where each integer \(t[j]\) satisfies \(1 \leq t[j] \leq 1000000\), representing the time required to solve the j-th subtask.

The function output is determined based on the relationships and constraints of the inputs. Thus, the functionality of the function is to accept the parameters specified and perform computations based on those parameters, ultimately returning a result influenced by these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer between 1 and 45), k (integer between 1 and 45), M (non-negative integer up to 2Â·10^9), and t (list of k integers each between 1 and 1,000,000), and returns a computed result based on these inputs.**
