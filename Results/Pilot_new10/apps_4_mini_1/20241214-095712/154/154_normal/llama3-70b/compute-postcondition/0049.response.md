Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input; `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum value of items that can be selected with the given integers within the weight limit `M`, considering all combinations of the integers in `t`. If `M` is 0, all values in `dp` remain 0 since no items can be selected.**
