Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here’s a detailed explanation of why it does so:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers: `n` (the number of tasks), `k` (the number of subtasks per task), and `M` (the total available time). It also correctly reads the subtasks' time requirements into a list `t`.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
    - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum points Polycarp can earn. It properly considers the full completion of tasks and the solving of additional subtasks.
    - The loop iterates over the number of complete tasks from 0 to `n`. For each potential complete task, it calculates the total time consumed (`time_used`) and checks if it exceeds `M`. This ensures that it doesn't go over the available time.
    - The points from complete tasks are calculated as `(complete_tasks * (k + 1))`, which is correct because completing a task earns the total of subtasks plus one extra point.
    - After accounting for completed tasks, the remaining time is calculated, and the program attempts to solve as many of the subtasks from the remaining time as possible.

3. **Subtask Calculation**: The program effectively calculates how many additional subtasks can be solved with the remaining time and ensures this does not exceed the total number of remaining subtasks available from incomplete tasks.

4. **Max Points Calculation**: The program keeps track of the maximum points (`max_points`) that could be achieved and returns this after checking all possible combinations of completed tasks and additional subtasks.

5. **Constraints Handling**: The constraints laid out by the problem (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, etc.) are respected throughout the code, and the logic comprehensively covers edge cases like having no time (`M=0`), or having more subtasks than could be theoretically completed given the time limits.

Overall, by iterating over the possible number of complete tasks and dynamically calculating the number of subtasks that can be resolved within the remaining time, the program accurately adheres to the problem description and correctly computes the maximum points achievable under the given constraints.
