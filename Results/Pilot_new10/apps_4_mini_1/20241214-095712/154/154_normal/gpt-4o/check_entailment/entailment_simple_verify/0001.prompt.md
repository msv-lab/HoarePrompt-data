You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the available time `M` is significantly less than the time needed to complete even one subtask. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1 0
1
```
In this case, Polycarp has `0` minutes to solve `1` task with `1` subtask that requires `1` minute. According to the problem description, since he cannot solve any subtasks, he should earn `0` points. However, the current implementation of the program goes through the loop checking for complete tasks and does not verify whether subtasks can even be attempted, potentially leading to an incorrect calculation of the maximum points. 

Thus, it is possible for this program to yield a result greater than `0` for cases where `M` is `0`. Hence, it does not conform correctly to the problem requirements. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

    total_time_per_task = sum(t)

                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task

        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers; `remaining_time` is updated to reflect the maximum time remaining after completing all possible tasks; `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its final accumulated value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`; `max_points` is updated to the maximum points achievable based on completed tasks and subtasks solved; `complete_tasks` is `n`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, and `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`.
    return max_points
    #The program returns max_points, which is updated to the maximum points achievable based on completed tasks (n) and subtasks solved, with points being equal to n multiplied by (k + 1) where complete_tasks is n, and time_used is equal to n multiplied by total_time_per_task.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
