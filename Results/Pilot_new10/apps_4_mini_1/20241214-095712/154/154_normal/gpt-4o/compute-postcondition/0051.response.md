Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `subtask_time` is the third element in `t`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. Otherwise, `remaining_time` remains unchanged and all other variables retain their previous states.***
