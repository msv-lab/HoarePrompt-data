Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is adjusted by subtracting (`max_subtasks_for_this_task` multiplied by `subtask_time`), `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is updated to the result of `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtask_time` is updated to the next element in `t`, the index of `t` is incremented accordingly, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.***
