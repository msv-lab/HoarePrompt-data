The value of `subtasks_solved` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers; `remaining_time` is now `M - (n + 1) * total_time_per_task`; `max_points` is unchanged; `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`; `time_used` is `(n + 1) * total_time_per_task`; `points` is `(n + 1) * (k + 1)`; `subtasks_solved` is 0**.
