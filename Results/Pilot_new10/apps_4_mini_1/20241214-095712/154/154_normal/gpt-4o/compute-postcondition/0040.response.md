The value of `remaining_time` is decreased by the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`. Since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the result of `remaining_time // subtask_time`, it indicates how many times we can fit `subtask_time` into `remaining_time`. Therefore, the value of `remaining_time` will reduce according to the number of subtasks that can be solved.

After the operation, `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - (max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time)`, which effectively makes it less than or equal to the previous `remaining_time`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`, `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to the integer division of the previous `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.**
