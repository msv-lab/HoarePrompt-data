The variable `complete_tasks` is updated to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` will take a value between 2 and 46.

Next, the variable `time_used` is then calculated by multiplying `complete_tasks` by `total_time_per_task`. The exact value of `time_used` is thus determined by the specific values of `complete_tasks` and `total_time_per_task`, which are not defined in the initial state.

The values of the other variables (`M`, `remaining_time`, `t`, `subtasks_solved`, `max_points`, and `points`) are unchanged or dependent on previous computations that do not impact this specific code execution.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ k ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers; `remaining_time` is unchanged; `subtasks_solved` is now min(`subtasks_solved`, (n - complete_tasks) * k); `max_points` is updated to max(`max_points`, `points` + `subtasks_solved`); `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`; `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.**
