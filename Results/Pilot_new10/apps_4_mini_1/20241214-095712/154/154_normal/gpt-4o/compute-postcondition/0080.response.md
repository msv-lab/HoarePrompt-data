The value of `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. Since `subtasks_solved` is defined as the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, the new value of `max_points` will depend on those calculations. The states of the other variables `n`, `k`, `M`, `remaining_time`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, and `points` remain unchanged. 

To summarize, the value of `max_points` will be evaluated as follows:
- Let `previous_max_points` be the initial value of `max_points`.
- Let `new_subtasks_solved` equal the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.
- The new value of `max_points` will be `max(previous_max_points, points + new_subtasks_solved)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `remaining_time` is adjusted; `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`; `max_points` is updated to max(`max_points`, `points` + `subtasks_solved`); `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, and `points` remain unchanged.**
