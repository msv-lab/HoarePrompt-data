Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `remaining_time` is updated based on the total subtasks that could be solved given the elements of `t`, `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks solved across all elements in `t`, and `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, and `points` retain their values calculated before the loop based on `n` and `k`.**
