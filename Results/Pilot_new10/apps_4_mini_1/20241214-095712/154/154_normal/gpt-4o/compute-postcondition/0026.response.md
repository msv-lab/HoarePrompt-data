Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `remaining_time` is the result of subtracting the total time used for all subtasks solved from the initial `M`, `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks solved across all elements in `t`, and if any `subtask_time` was greater than `remaining_time`, those elements would not contribute to the total subtasks solved.**
