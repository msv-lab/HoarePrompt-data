The variable `subtasks_solved` is increased by the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is computed as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and since `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is at least 1. Therefore, `subtasks_solved` will be incremented by at least 1. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n`, `k` is at least 1, `M`, `t` is a list of `k` integers with at least 1 element, `subtask_time` is equal to `t[0]`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task` which is at least 1.**
