`subtasks_solved` is incremented by the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, which is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and `remaining_time` remain unchanged, while `subtask_time` is set to the next element in `t` based on its incremented index. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `remaining_time` is adjusted appropriately, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.**
