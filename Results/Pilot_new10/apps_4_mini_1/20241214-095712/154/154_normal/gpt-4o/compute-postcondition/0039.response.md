The variable `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The value of `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The variables `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `subtask_time`, and `remaining_time` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers that must have at least 1 element, `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`, `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.**
