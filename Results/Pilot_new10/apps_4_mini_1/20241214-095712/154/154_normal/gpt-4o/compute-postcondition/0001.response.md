The variable `max_points` is assigned the value of 0. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask; `total_time_per_task` is equal to the sum of all elements in `t`; `max_points` is 0.**
