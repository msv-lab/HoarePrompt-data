Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ k ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers; `remaining_time` is unchanged; `subtasks_solved` is now min(`subtasks_solved`, (n - complete_tasks) * k); `max_points` is updated to max(`max_points`, `points` + `subtasks_solved`); `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`; `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`; if `time_used` exceeds `M`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
