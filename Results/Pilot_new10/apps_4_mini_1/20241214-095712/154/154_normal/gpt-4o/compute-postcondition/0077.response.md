Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is adjusted to `remaining_time - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` becomes `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.***
