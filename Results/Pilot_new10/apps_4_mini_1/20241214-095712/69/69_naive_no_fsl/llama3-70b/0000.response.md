Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw in its handling of impossible cases. Specifically, after calculating `dx` and `dy` (the differences in the number of movements required in the x and y directions), the condition `if dx < 0 or dy < 0:` only checks if the remaining movements needed are negative, which does not account for scenarios where the required number of moves is greater than what is available in the sequence. For example, if the target is `(2, 2)` and the original operations are `UUU`, the `dx` and `dy` values would be initialized to `2` but there are not enough moves for `R` and `D` in the original sequence. Thus, the correct output in such a case would be `-1`, but due to the faulty check, it may incorrectly assume a valid path.

Additionally, the program does not correctly track indices of the operations that need to be changed (`minID` and `maxID`), leading to potentially wrong calculations of the length of the changed subsegment since it might not reflect the actual segments being modified. 

Here is a specific counter-example:
Input:
```
3
UUU
2 2
```
Expected output: `-1` (cannot reach `(2, 2)` with only upward movements), but the program will output `0` since `dx` and `dy` will both be non-negative after the initial checks. 

Thus, there are cases where the program does not follow the given problem description correctly.
