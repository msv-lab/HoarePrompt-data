#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), operations is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and x and y are integers with -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    x, y = map(int, input().split())

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the net effect of 'R' and 'L' operations, `uy` is the net effect of 'U' and 'D' operations, `lx` is 0 and `ly` is 0.

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations; `res` is the count of ignored operations; `dx` is equal to `max(0, x - ux - R_count)` where `R_count` is the number of 'R' operations; `dy` is equal to `max(0, y - uy - U_count)` where `U_count` is the number of 'U' operations; `ops` represents the executed operations resulting in changes.
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations. If either `dx` or `dy` is less than 0, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, `dx` is updated to be the maximum of `0` or `x - ux - R_count`, `dy` is updated to be the maximum of `0` or `y - uy - U_count`, and `res` represents the count of ignored operations with `ops` reflecting the executed operations resulting in changes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (the number of operations), a string `ops` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' representing movement directions, and two integers `x` and `y` as starting coordinates. It calculates the net effect of the operations on coordinates based on the movements. If the remaining distance in either the x or y direction is negative after applying the movements, it returns -1. Otherwise, it counts and returns the number of operations that did not change the position (i.e., ignored operations) needed to reach the final targeted coordinates (x, y).
