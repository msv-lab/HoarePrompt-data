`dx` is incremented by 1, but since the previous value of `dx` is not given, we cannot specify its final value directly. The other variables retain their values as `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` has a length of at least `len(ops)`, and `op` is the subsequent character in `ops`. Therefore, the output state considers the increment of `dx`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` has a length of at least `len(ops)`, `op` is the subsequent character in `ops`, and `dx` is increased by 1.**
