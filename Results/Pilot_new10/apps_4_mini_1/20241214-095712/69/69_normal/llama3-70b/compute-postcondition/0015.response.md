The code `ux -= 1` decrements the value of `ux` by 1. The initial state specifies that `ux` is 0, meaning this operation will result in `ux` being -1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` is the input string, `op` is the first character in `ops`, `ux` is -1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, and `op` is not equal to 'R' (current value of `op` is 'L').**
