Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` has a length of at least `len(ops) + 1`, and `op` is the next character in `ops`. If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decreased by 1. If not, and if `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decremented by 1. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is incremented by 1. In any other case, `res` is increased by 1.***
