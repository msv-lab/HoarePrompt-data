Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, and `ops` is derived from `operations`. If `op` is equal to 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is an integer greater than -1. In all other cases, either `op` is not 'L' or `dx` is greater than or equal to 0, and `res` is increased by 1.***
