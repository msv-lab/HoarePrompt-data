`dy` is incremented by 1. Given that `dy` is less than 0, after this operation, the value of `dy` becomes `dy + 1`, which will still be negative but closer to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` is derived from `operations`, `op` is 'D', and `dy` is now less than or equal to 0 (since it has been incremented by 1).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` is derived from `operations`, `op` is 'D', and `dy` is now less than or equal to 0.**
