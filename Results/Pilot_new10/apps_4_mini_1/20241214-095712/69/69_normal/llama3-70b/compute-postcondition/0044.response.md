To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variable `ops` within the context of the given state. The loop will iterate over `ops`, which is presumably derived from `operations`. Since `operations` is stated to be a non-empty string, we can infer that `ops` should be a valid iterable derived from `operations`.

Step by step analysis:

1. **Non-emptiness of `operations`**: Since `operations` is non-empty, this ensures that `ops` can be iterated over. Therefore, at the start of the loop, there must be at least one operation to process.

2. **Initialization of `op`**: Within the loop, `op` will take on values from `ops`. Since `ops` is being derived from a non-empty string (`operations`), we can deduce that the first `op` can be initialized from the first character of `operations`.

3. **Variables**: The current values of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, `dx`, `dy`, and `res` are mentioned, but they do not affect the execution conditions for the loop itself. They are more relevant to the computations within the loop body.

Thus, in order for the loop to execute, the `operations` must simply not be empty, and `op` must be defined based on the first character in `operations`.

Final Statement of State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` is derived from `operations`, `op` is the first character of `operations`**
