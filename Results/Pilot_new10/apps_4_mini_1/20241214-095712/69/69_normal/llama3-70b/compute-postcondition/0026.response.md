Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `operations` is a non-empty string. If `op` is 'R', then `ux` is incremented by 1, and `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` are updated according to the new `op`. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is decreased by 1, and `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` are also updated according to the new `op`.***
