Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` has a length of at least `len(ops)`, if `op` is 'U' and `dy` > 0, then `dy` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'D' and `dy` < 0, `dy` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` > 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1; if `op` is 'L' and `dx` is negative, then `dx` is increased by 1; otherwise, `res` is increased by 1.***
