After executing the code `uy += 1`, the value of `uy` increments by 1. The initial state indicated that `uy` was 0, so after the increment, `uy` will be 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` is the input string, `op` is the first character in `ops`, which is equal to 'U', `ux` is 0, `uy` is 1, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0**
