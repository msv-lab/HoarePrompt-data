Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string, and `op` is the next character in `operations`. If `op` is 'U', then `ux` remains unchanged, `uy` is updated to `uy + 1`, while `lx` and `ly` remain unchanged. If `op` is 'D', then `uy` is updated to `uy - 1`, and `ux`, `lx`, and `ly` are unchanged. If `op` is 'R', then `ux` is increased by 1, and `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` remain unchanged. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is decremented by 1, and `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` remain unchanged.***
