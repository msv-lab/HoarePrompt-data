`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer based on input (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and `x` and `y` are unchanged integers with -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and `x` and `y` remain integers with -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9.**
