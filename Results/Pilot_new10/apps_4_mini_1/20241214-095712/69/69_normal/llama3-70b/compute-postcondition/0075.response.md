The value of `dx` is decremented by 1. The variable `n` is a positive integer and does not change, nor do `operations`, `ops`, or `op`. The specific previous value of `dx` is unknown, but it will now be `dx - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` has a length of at least `len(ops)`, `op` is the subsequent character in `ops`, and `dx` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` has a length of at least `len(ops)`, `op` is the subsequent character in `ops`, and `dx` is decreased by 1.**
