Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n`; `op` is beyond the last character in the string. If `op` equals 'D', then `final_y` is decreased by 1. If `op` equals 'L', then `final_x` is decremented by 1. If `op` equals 'R', then `final_x` is incremented by 1.***
