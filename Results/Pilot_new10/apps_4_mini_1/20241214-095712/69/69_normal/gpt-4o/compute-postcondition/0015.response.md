Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters U, D, L, and R, and `op` is the first character of `operations`. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is increased by 1.***
