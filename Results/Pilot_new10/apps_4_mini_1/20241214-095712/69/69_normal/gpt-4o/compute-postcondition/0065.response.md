Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, and if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `min_length` is equal to `length` with `position_map` remaining {(0, 0): -1} and `target_pos` equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`.***
