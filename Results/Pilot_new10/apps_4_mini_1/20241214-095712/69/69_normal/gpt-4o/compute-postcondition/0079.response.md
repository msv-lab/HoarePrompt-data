The variable `position_map` is updated to include the key `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i`. The previous state of `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}. There are no other variables directly affected by this line of code in terms of their numeric values. However, the key-value pair being added indicates that at position `(current_x, current_y)`, the current index `i` holds significance. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `position_map`.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}, `i` is `i_current + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i_current + 1`.**
