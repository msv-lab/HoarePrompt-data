`dy` is assigned the value of `y - final_y`. The value of `final_y` is `count_U - count_D`, so `dy` becomes `y - (count_U - count_D)`, which simplifies to `dy = y + count_D - count_U`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`final_x` is `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, and `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`.**
