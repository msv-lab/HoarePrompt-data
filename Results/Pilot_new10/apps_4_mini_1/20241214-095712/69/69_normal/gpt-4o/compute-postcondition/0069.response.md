The value of `current_y` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected; they retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `position_map` remains {(0, 0): -1}, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_current + 1`, and `current_y` is decreased by 1.**
