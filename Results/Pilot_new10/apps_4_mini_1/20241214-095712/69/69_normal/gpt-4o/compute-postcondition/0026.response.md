Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n`. If `op` equals 'U', then `final_y` is increased by 1. If `op` is beyond the last character in `operations` and equals 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1; if `op` equals 'L', `final_x` is decremented by 1; if `op` equals 'R', `final_x` is incremented by 1.***
