Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L` and `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`. If the operation at index `i` is 'U', then `position_map` is updated to {(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y + 1): i}, while `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, and `i` is incremented to `i_current + 2`, with `n` remaining greater than `i_current + 2`. If the operation at index `i` is 'D', then `current_y` is decreased by 1. If the operation at index `i` is 'L', then `dx` is set to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, and `position_map` updates to {(0, 0): -1, (current_x - 1, current_y): i}. Otherwise, if the operation at index `i` is 'R', then `current_x` is increased by 1, while `final_x`, `final_y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `position_map` remain unchanged. Additionally, `i` is updated to `i_current + 2`, and `n` is still greater than `i_current + 2.***
