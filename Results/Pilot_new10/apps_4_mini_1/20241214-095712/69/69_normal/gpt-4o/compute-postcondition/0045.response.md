The code initializes a dictionary `position_map` with one key-value pair: the key is the tuple `(0, 0)` and the value is `-1`. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables or their states. Therefore, no specific values have changed nor have any previous values been modified.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `min_length` is equal to float('inf'), `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}.**
