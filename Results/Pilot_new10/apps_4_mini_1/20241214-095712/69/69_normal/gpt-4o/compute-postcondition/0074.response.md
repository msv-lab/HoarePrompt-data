Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `position_map` remains {(0, 0): -1}, `i` is `i_current + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i_current + 1`. If `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_y` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `operations[i]` is 'L', then `current_x` is decreased by 1; if it is 'R', then `current_x` is increased by 1.***
