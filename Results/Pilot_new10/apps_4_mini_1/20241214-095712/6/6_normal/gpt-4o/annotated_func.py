#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), pos is an integer representing the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), l is an integer representing the minimum index of the segment to be kept open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), and r is an integer representing the maximum index of the segment to be kept open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n).
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    if (l == 1 and r == n) :
        print(0)
    else :
        if (l == 1) :

        else :
            if (r == n) :
                print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
            else :
                move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
                move_to_r = abs(pos - r)

            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers. If `r` is equal to `n`, the output is the value of `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is calculated as `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is calculated as `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, with `close_both_sides` being printed.

Otherwise, if `r` is equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If neither condition is true, `move_to_l` is calculated as `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is calculated as `abs(pos - r)`, and the value of `close_both_sides`, which is `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, is printed.

Otherwise, if `l` equals 1, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. If `r` equals `n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If neither condition is true, `move_to_l` is calculated as `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is calculated as `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides`, computed as `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters: `n`, which represents the total number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `pos`, which indicates the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), `l`, which is the minimum index of the segment to be kept open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), and `r`, which is the maximum index of the segment to be kept open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n). It prints the number of moves required to close tabs outside the segment `[l, r]` based on the cursor's position. If the entire range of tabs is to be kept open (i.e., `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`), it prints 0. If only the leftmost tab is kept open (i.e., `l` equals 1), it returns the distance from the cursor to the rightmost tab plus one. If only the rightmost tab is kept open (i.e., `r` equals `n`), it returns the distance from the cursor to the leftmost tab plus one. If both sides have tabs to close, it calculates the two potential moves required to close from either side and prints the minimum of those moves plus the number of tabs being closed, which is `(r - l + 2)`. The function does not handle inputs that fall outside the specified ranges for `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`.
