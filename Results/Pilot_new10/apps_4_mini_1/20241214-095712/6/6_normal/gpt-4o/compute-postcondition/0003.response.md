Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs, `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position, `l` is an integer representing the minimum index of the segment to be kept open, `r` is an integer representing the maximum index of the segment to be kept open. The values of `l` and `r` are such that either `l` is not equal to 1 or `r` is not equal to `n` (i.e., not both `l == 1` and `r == n` are true).***
