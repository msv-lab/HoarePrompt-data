Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs, `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position, `l` is an integer representing the minimum index of the segment to be kept open, `r` is an integer representing the maximum index of the segment to be kept open. The value of `r` is less than `n`, and the value of `l` is greater than 1, ensuring that not both `l == 1` and `r == n` are true.***
