The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 

- `n`: an integer representing the number of tabs, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `pos`: an integer representing the current cursor position, where 1 ≤ pos ≤ n.
- `l`: an integer representing the minimum index of the segment to be kept open, where 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.
- `r`: an integer representing the maximum index of the segment to be kept open, where 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.

After executing the function body, the output will depend on the values of the input parameters, but the specific outputs are not provided in the prompt. Therefore, without further details on the return values based on the inputs, we can summarize the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer for number of tabs), pos (integer for current cursor position), l (integer for minimum index), and r (integer for maximum index). It processes these inputs to manage tab visibility based on the specified range.**
