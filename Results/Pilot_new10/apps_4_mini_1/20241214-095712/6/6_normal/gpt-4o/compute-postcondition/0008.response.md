The code calculates the value to be printed, which is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. The values of `n`, `pos`, and `l` are all unchanged after this execution. The current value of `r` is equal to `n`, but since it is not used in the expression, it remains as is. The `print` function will display the calculated result, but it does not change any variables.

Since `l` is already greater than 1, the initial state constraints remain valid after execution. The output would contain the result of the computation:

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs, `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position, `l` is an integer greater than 1, `r` is equal to `n`, and the printed result is `abs(pos - l) + 1`.**
