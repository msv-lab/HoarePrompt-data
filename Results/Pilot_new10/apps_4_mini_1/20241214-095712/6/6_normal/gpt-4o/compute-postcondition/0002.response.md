The `print(0)` statement outputs the integer 0 to the console. It does not change any of the variable values (`n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`) in the program. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the program has printed 0 while maintaining the previous states of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs, `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position, `l` equals 1, `r` equals `n`, and 0 has been printed.**
