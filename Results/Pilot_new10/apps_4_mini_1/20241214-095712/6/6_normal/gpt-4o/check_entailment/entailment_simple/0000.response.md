To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and verify if it handles all possible scenarios appropriately.

1. **Basic Logic**:
    - The program takes the input of four integers: `n` (total tabs), `pos` (current cursor position), `l` (leftmost index of tabs to keep), and `r` (rightmost index of tabs to keep).
    
2. **Special Case Handling**:
    - If `l == 1` and `r == n`, indicating that all tabs should be kept, the output is `0` seconds (no tabs to close).
    - If `l == 1`, it only needs to close tabs to the right of the cursor, calculating the number of seconds as the distance to the rightmost tab (`r`) plus one second to close those tabs.
    - If `r == n`, it only needs to close tabs to the left of the cursor, calculating the number of seconds as the distance to the leftmost tab (`l`) plus one second to close those tabs.

3. **General Case Handling**:
    - If both `l > 1` and `r < n`, the program calculates the seconds required to move to either end of the range (`l` or `r`), followed by the operation of closing tabs outside the specified range, which always takes `r - l + 2` seconds:
        - The first component is an additional second for moving to either `l` from `pos` or `r` from `pos`.
        - The second component reflects the necessity of closing tabs on both sides.

4. **Output Logic**:
    - The program evaluates the minimum of the closing time for both scenarios:
        - **Closing to the left of `l`** after moving from `pos` to `l`.
        - **Closing to the right of `r`** after moving from `pos` to `r`.

5. **Key Observations**:
   - The addition of `2` in `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and its counterpart for `move_to_r` correctly accounts for the movements and the closing action. 
   - The use of `min` ensures that the program optimally decides which side's closer action yields a lesser total time.

6. **Functionality Verification**:
   - It properly accounts for boundaries (`l` and `r`) and current cursor positions, providing corresponding outputs in all given cases.
   - The program effectively handles all potential edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
Upon thorough evaluation, it is evident that the program consistently adheres to the problem description and correctly calculates the minimum seconds required to close all tabs outside the specified range.

Thus, the correctness of the program can be confirmed:

Correctness: **True**
