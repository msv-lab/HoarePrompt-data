You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    elif l == 1:
        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
    elif r == n:
        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
    else:
        move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
        move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
        close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
        print(close_both_sides)


```
Output hints: The function accepts four integer parameters: `n`, which represents the total number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `pos`, which indicates the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), `l`, which is the minimum index of the segment to be kept open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), and `r`, which is the maximum index of the segment to be kept open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n). It prints the number of moves required to close tabs outside the segment `[l, r]` based on the cursor's position. If the entire range of tabs is to be kept open (i.e., `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`), it prints 0. If only the leftmost tab is kept open (i.e., `l` equals 1), it returns the distance from the cursor to the rightmost tab plus one. If only the rightmost tab is kept open (i.e., `r` equals `n`), it returns the distance from the cursor to the leftmost tab plus one. If both sides have tabs to close, it calculates the two potential moves required to close from either side and prints the minimum of those moves plus the number of tabs being closed, which is `(r - l + 2)`. The function does not handle inputs that fall outside the specified ranges for `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
