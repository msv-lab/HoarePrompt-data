Functionality: ** The function accepts four integers `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` via user input, where `n` is between 1 and 100, `pos` is between 1 and `n`, and `l` and `r` are such that `1 <= l <= r <= n`. It calculates a value `ans` based on the position of `pos` relative to `l` and `r`, updating `ans` based on specific conditions. It then prints the final value of `ans`, which represents the total distance or adjustments needed to fit the `pos` within the boundaries defined by `l` and `r`, considering also how far `pos` is from the start and end limits of the range. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.**
