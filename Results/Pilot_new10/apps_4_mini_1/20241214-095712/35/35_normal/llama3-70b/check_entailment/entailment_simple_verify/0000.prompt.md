You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
            break
        x -= 1
    print(x)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we can analyze the logic based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Input**: We have three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent:
   - `n`: Number of plates (and hence also the number of guests).
   - `a`: Number of pieces of the first cake.
   - `b`: Number of pieces of the second cake.
   
2. **Output**: We need to find the maximum number `x` such that each plate has at least `x` pieces of only one of the two cakes, with certain constraints:
   - Each piece of cake must be used.
   - Each plate must have at least one piece of cake.
   - Plates can only contain pieces from one type of cake.

### Program Analysis
The provided program aims to find this maximum `x`. Let's break down its logic:

- It starts with `x` being set to the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It enters a loop where it checks:
  - If both `a` and `b` can provide at least `x` pieces, and,
  - If the remaining pieces after giving `x` from both cakes can provide at least `x` to distribute to the remaining plates.
- If the conditions are met, it breaks the loop, otherwise it decrements `x`.

### Potential Errors
1. **Decrement Logic**: The variable `x` is decremented without a proper exit condition handling. If `x` starts from `min(n, a, b)` but the loop could potentially run indefinitely if the conditions are never satisfied, particularly if `x` becomes negative or zero. This can happen if the constraints regarding the plates and pieces are incorrectly handled.

2. **Invalid Base Cases**: Consider edge cases, for example:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 1`, `b = 0`
     - In this case, `x` would be initialized to `min(5, 1, 0) = 0`, then it would proceed into the while loop, trying to decrement `x`. This would not make logical sense since minimum pieces can't be negative, and there are not enough pieces to satisfy each plate.

### Conclusion
Given the decrement without proper bounds checking and no handling of cases where no solution can be made (like having fewer pieces than plates or checking upper limits of `a` and `b`) the program does not meet the required conditions in every case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program can fail with inputs where there aren't enough pieces to cover all plates correctly according to the constraints, particularly when one cake is exhausted or when plates exceed available pieces.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).
def func():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and a - x + (b - x) >= x:
            break
        
        x -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is equal to the maximum integer such that `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x`, after at most `min(n, a, b)` decrements, `n`, `a`, `b` are integers with the conditions 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ 100.
    print(x)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
