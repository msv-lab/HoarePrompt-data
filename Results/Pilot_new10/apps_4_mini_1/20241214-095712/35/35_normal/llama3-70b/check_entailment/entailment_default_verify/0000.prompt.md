You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
            break
        x -= 1
    print(x)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we can analyze the logic based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Input**: We have three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent:
   - `n`: Number of plates (and hence also the number of guests).
   - `a`: Number of pieces of the first cake.
   - `b`: Number of pieces of the second cake.
   
2. **Output**: We need to find the maximum number `x` such that each plate has at least `x` pieces of only one of the two cakes, with certain constraints:
   - Each piece of cake must be used.
   - Each plate must have at least one piece of cake.
   - Plates can only contain pieces from one type of cake.

### Program Analysis
The provided program aims to find this maximum `x`. Let's break down its logic:

- It starts with `x` being set to the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It enters a loop where it checks:
  - If both `a` and `b` can provide at least `x` pieces, and,
  - If the remaining pieces after giving `x` from both cakes can provide at least `x` to distribute to the remaining plates.
- If the conditions are met, it breaks the loop, otherwise it decrements `x`.

### Potential Errors
1. **Decrement Logic**: The variable `x` is decremented without a proper exit condition handling. If `x` starts from `min(n, a, b)` but the loop could potentially run indefinitely if the conditions are never satisfied, particularly if `x` becomes negative or zero. This can happen if the constraints regarding the plates and pieces are incorrectly handled.

2. **Invalid Base Cases**: Consider edge cases, for example:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 1`, `b = 0`
     - In this case, `x` would be initialized to `min(5, 1, 0) = 0`, then it would proceed into the while loop, trying to decrement `x`. This would not make logical sense since minimum pieces can't be negative, and there are not enough pieces to satisfy each plate.

### Conclusion
Given the decrement without proper bounds checking and no handling of cases where no solution can be made (like having fewer pieces than plates or checking upper limits of `a` and `b`) the program does not meet the required conditions in every case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program can fail with inputs where there aren't enough pieces to cover all plates correctly according to the constraints, particularly when one cake is exhausted or when plates exceed available pieces.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts three integers through user input—`n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the maximum integer `x` such that `x` does not exceed `n`, is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`, and still allows equal distribution of leftovers (`a - x` and `b - x`) to be at least `x`. The function then prints this calculated value of `x`. There is an implicit precondition that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`. The function does not handle input errors, such as non-integer inputs. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
