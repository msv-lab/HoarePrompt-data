You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
            break
        x -= 1
    print(x)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of pieces x that can be distributed to the plates. The main issue arises in the following line inside the while loop:

```python
if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
```

This condition is intended to ensure that each cake has enough pieces to distribute x pieces per plate. However, it fails to account for the specific distribution across n plates with the following constraints:
1. Each plate must contain at least x pieces.
2. Each plate must only contain pieces from one cake.

The loop is not managing the balance correctly between the two cakes or ensuring the required distribution, particularly when the total pieces of cakes are significantly higher or lower than n. 

For example, the case `5 2 3` should yield 1, which it does, but consider the case `3 5 5`. In this situation, although x can be evaluated starting at 3, the program will incorrectly reduce it until it finds an x that does not satisfy the constraints properly. The correct maximum x should be determined based on proper distribution logic reflecting the number of plates and ensuring both cakes can be used without mixing and still satisfy the requirement for at least one piece per plate.

Another example could be `2 1 1`, which should yield an x of 1 since there are 2 plates and each would receive one piece, but the program's logic is flawed enough that it can induce inconsistencies or fail to follow the rules of distribution completely in more complex examples. 

Therefore, the program's logic isn't robust enough to handle edge cases where the number of pieces limits proper distribution across the plates while adhering to the outlined requirements. Thus, it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).
def func():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and a - x + (b - x) >= x:
            break
        
        x -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is equal to the maximum integer such that `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x`, after at most `min(n, a, b)` decrements, `n`, `a`, `b` are integers with the conditions 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ 100.
    print(x)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
