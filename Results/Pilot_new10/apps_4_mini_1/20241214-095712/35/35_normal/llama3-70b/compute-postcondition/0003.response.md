Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `b` are integers obtained from user input; 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ 100; `x` is equal to min(n, a, b). The current values are such that `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is greater than or equal to `x`.***
