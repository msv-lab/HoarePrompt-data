The variable `x` is assigned the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b`. Given the constraints that `n` is at least 2 and at most `a + b`, and both `a` and `b` are between 1 and 100, we determine that `x` will hold a value that is equal to or less than `n`, `a`, or `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b` are integers obtained from user input; 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ 100; `x` is equal to min(n, a, b)**
