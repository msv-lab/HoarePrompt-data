The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b` are integers obtained from user input; 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ 100; `x` is equal to min(n, a, b) - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
