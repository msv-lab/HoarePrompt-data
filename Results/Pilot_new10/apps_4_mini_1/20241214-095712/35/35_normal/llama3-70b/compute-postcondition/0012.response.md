The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as the `break` statement only affects the flow of control by exiting from the most internal loop or conditional statement it is inside, but no specific values are manipulated or changed.

Since the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are based on user input and remain within the specified constraints, the condition regarding `x` which is equal to `min(n, a, b) - 2` would also not change due to the `break`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n`, `a`, `b` are integers obtained from user input; `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b` are integers obtained from user input; `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
