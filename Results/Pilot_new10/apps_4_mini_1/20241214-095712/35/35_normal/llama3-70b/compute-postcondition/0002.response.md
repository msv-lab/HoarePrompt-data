Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely as long as there are no exit conditions within the loop body itself. Therefore, no modifications to the program state are necessary to ensure the loop can execute at least one iteration. 

State: **`n`, `a`, `b` are integers obtained from user input; 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ 100; `x` is equal to min(n, a, b)**
