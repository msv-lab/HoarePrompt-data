Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns true, then `low` is updated to (1 + (min(a, b) + 1) // 2) + 1, `high` remains as min(a, b) + 1, and `mid` is recalculated as (1 + high) // 2. Otherwise, `low` remains 1, `high` is updated to (1 + high) // 2, and `mid` is recalculated as (1 + high) // 2 with `can_distribute(mid)` returning false.***
