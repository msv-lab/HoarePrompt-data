Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (the number of plates, where 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), and two integers `a` and `b` (the number of pieces of two different cakes, both between 1 and 100). The function performs a binary search to find the maximum number of plates that can be distributed based on the conditions defined in the `can_distribute` function, returning `low - 1`, where `low` is the threshold found when the binary search concludes. The function does not handle edge cases where `n` might be less than 2 or greater than `a + b`, assuming these conditions are met prior to the call.**
