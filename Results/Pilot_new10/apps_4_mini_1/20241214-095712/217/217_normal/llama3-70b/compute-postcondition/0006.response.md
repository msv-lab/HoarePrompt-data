`b` is assigned the value of `b + a[i]`, where `a[i]` is the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Since `i` is even, `b` will be updated accordingly. The values of `n`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged and valid. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`, `c` is 0, `i` is 0.**
