The variable `a` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes input as a string, splits it into components, converts each component into an integer, and creates a list. The variable `n` is not directly affected by this code, but `n` is mentioned as an input integer, defining a range of values for context. The output state reflects the updated value of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from the input provided.**
