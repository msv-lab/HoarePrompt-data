According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an odd integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since `i` is currently an odd integer, the next value of `i` will be even. 

To execute again, the new value of `i` needs to be calculated:
- If `i` is currently odd, it can be represented as `i = 2k + 1` for some integer `k`, and the next increment will make `i = 2k + 2` which is even. 

The loop continues executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. Thus, if `i` is incremented to this next even number, `n` must also be greater than `2k + 2`. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- The new value of `i` is `i + 1` (an even integer).
- `n` must be greater than the new odd integer (`i + 1`).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order; `b` retains its previous value; `c` retains its previous value; `i` is the next integer after the odd integer (i + 1).**
