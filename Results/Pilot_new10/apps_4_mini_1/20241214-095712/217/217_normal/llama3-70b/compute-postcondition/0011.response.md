The variable `b` is updated by adding the value from the list `a` at the index `i`. The variable `i` is defined as the next integer after an odd integer, which implies it is even. Therefore, when `b` is updated with `a[i]`, the value being added to `b` depends on the values in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, the specific value of `a[i]` will correspond to the even index `i`. However, since the previous states of `b` and `c` retain their values and no information is given about `b`, we specify that only `b` is affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order; `c` retains its previous value; `i` is the next integer after the odd integer; `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`.**
