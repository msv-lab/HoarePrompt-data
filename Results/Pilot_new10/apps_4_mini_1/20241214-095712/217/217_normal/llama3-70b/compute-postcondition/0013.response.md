Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order; if `i` is even, then `b` is updated to `b + a[i]` while `c` retains its previous value. If `i` is odd, then `c` is updated to `c + a[i]` while `b` retains its previous value; `i` remains the next integer after the odd integer (i + 1).***
