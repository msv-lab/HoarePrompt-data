You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    (b, c) = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            b += a[i]
        else:
            c += a[i]
    print(b - c)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem description and how the code implements it.

The task is to partition the given sequence `a` into two sequences `b` and `c` such that:
- `B` is the sum of elements in `b`
- `C` is the sum of elements in `c`
- The objective is to maximize `B - C`.

Key points in the provided code:
1. The input sequence `a` is sorted in descending order.
2. The elements are distributed between the two sequences based on the index: even-indexed elements go to `b`, while odd-indexed elements go to `c`.
3. Finally, it calculates and prints `B - C`.

Now, let's consider if there might be instances where the program logic fails to achieve the correct maximum value of `B - C`.

### Verification Through Edge Cases

1. **Single Element Case**
   - Input: 
     ```
     1
     5
     ```
   - Expected Output: `5` (Choosing `b` as `{5}`, `c` as `{}` gives `5 - 0 = 5`)
   - Produced by code: `B = 5`, `C = 0`, `B - C = 5`

2. **All Negative Numbers**
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     -1 -2 -3
     ```
   - Expected Output: `2` (Choosing `b` as `{-1}`, `c` as `{-2, -3}` gives `B = -1`, `C = -5`, so `B - C = -1 - (-5) = 4`)
   - Produced by code: `B = -1`, `C = -5`, `B - C = 4` 
     
   Both cases produce correct output.

3. **Even Number of Elements Leading to Incorrect Partition**:
   - Input: 
     ```
     4
     1 2 3 4
     ```
   - Expected Output: `10` (Choosing `b = {1, 2, 3, 4}`, `c = {}` gives `B = 10`, `C = 0`, so `B - C = 10`)
   - Produced by code: Pairs up as `b = {4, 2}` and `c = {3, 1}`, gives `B = 6`, `C = 4`, so `B - C = 2`.

From this analysis, it’s seen that the program fails to yield the correct output for certain inputs, specifically in how it assigns elements to sequences `b` and `c`. The logic depends entirely on the index which does not guarantee that the maximum value of `B - C` will always be achieved.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**

The program correctly computes results for some cases, but fails to do so consistently. The partitioning strategy used (based on even and odd indexes) does not account for all potential maximum configuration arrangements of the sequences leading to incorrect output in certain scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, sorts the list in descending order, and calculates the difference between the sum of integers at even indices and the sum of integers at odd indices. It then prints this difference. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the result to the console. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
