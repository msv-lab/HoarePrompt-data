Correctness: **False**

The provided code attempts to maximize the expression \( B - C \) by sorting the sequence \( a \) in descending order and partitioning it between two sums \( B \) and \( C \) based on the index parity. However, this approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the maximum possible value of \( B - C \) is achieved for all distributions of the elements.

For example, consider the input:

```
4
1 -1 2 -2
```

If we follow the approach in the program, we would sort the list as `[2, 1, -1, -2]`, leading to:

- \( b = 2 + (-1) = 1 \)
- \( c = 1 + (-2) = -1 \)

Thus, the computed value \( B - C = 1 - (-1) = 2 \).

However, the optimal partition for maximizing \( B - C \) would be \( b = {2, 1} \) and \( c = {-1, -2} \):

- \( B = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
- \( C = -1 + (-2) = -3 \)

This results in \( B - C = 3 - (-3) = 6 \), which is larger than the value computed by the program.

Therefore, since there are cases where the program does not yield the maximum possible value as required, it cannot be considered correct.
