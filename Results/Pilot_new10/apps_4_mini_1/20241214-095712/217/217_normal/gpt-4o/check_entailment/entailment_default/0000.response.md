The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. It calculates the sum of all positive integers (B) and the sum of all negative integers (C) in the list and computes the maximum possible value of B - C.

The problem states that we can partition the sequence into two sequences b and c. By choosing all positive numbers for sequence b and all negative numbers for sequence c, the program achieves the maximum value for B - C:

1. If the number is positive, it adds to B.
2. If the number is negative, it contributes negatively to C. Thus, subtracting a negative value is equivalent to adding its absolute value, which maximizes the difference.

The output hints agree with the code, and they confirm that the program is taking into account all relevant parts of the problem. It correctly handles each input case mentioned in the problem description, and the examples provided show that it computes the expected outputs.

Additionally, the constraints provided in the problem (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100) align with the input method (it reads n integers in the specified range).

In conclusion, since the program meets the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases:

Correctness: **True**.
