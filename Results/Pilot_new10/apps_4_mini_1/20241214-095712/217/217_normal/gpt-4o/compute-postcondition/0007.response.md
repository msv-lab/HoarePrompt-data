Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers, each between -100 and 100. It calculates the sum of all positive integers in the list (`B`) and the sum of all negative integers in the list (`C`), then computes the difference `B - C`, which is printed as the result. The function does not handle any input errors or cases where the input does not meet the specified constraints. **
