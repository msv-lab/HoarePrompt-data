`B` is assigned the sum of all positive integers from the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer input between 1 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, each ranging from -100 to 100. The output state captures the total sum of the positive integers from the list `a`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, and `B` is equal to the sum of all positive integers in `a`.**
