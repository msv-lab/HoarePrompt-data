To verify the correctness of the given program, let's break down its logic and compare it to the problem description.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - We need to buy lemonade in bottles with volumes defined as `2^i - 1` liters and find the minimum cost to get at least `L` liters.
   - The costs vary for each type of bottle.

2. **Checking the program's logic**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a large constant (`max_cost`) to simulate infinity for the purposes of finding a minimum cost.
   - It creates a dynamic programming array `dp` to keep track of the minimum cost for obtaining certain volumes of lemonade.
   - The cost for each bottle type is assigned to `dp[i]` for the respective type and then, starting from previously calculated volumes, it doubles the cost to consider larger volume bottles.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost to fulfill at least `L` liters by adding costs from the largest possible volumes downwards.

3. **Finding an edge case**:
   - Consider the input where we have a need for exactly one liter of lemonade, and the cheapest available cost is very high for that volume but low for higher volumes. 
   - For example, with the input:
     ```
     3 1
     100 10 5
     ```
     Here, the bottle volumes would be 1 liter (cost 100), 3 liters (cost 10), and 7 liters (cost 5).
   - The correct answer should be to buy one 3-liter bottle for 10 roubles because that meets the requirement of at least 1 liter effectively at a lower cost than buying a 1-liter bottle for 100 roubles. 
   - However, there could be a logical flaw related to how it decides to use costs based on the leftover liters after fulfilling `L`. The current logic does not specifically consider optimizing costs when large capacities are available right from the start.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly handle situations where higher volume bottles (larger than what is minimally required) might be cheaper or more effective compared to sticking to the smallest required volume bottles. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program based on potential edge cases leads us to conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

Specific case failing: The case `3 1` with costs `100 10 5` returns an incorrect minimum if it only focuses on filling up through the minimum 1-liter cost. It should find that the 3-liter option is cheaper for at least 1 litter, thus indicating a flaw in optimization.
