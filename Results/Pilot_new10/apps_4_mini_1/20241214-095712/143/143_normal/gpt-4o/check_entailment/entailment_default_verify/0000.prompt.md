You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input
4 3
10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input
4 3
10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input
5 787787787
123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
    return answer


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description regarding purchasing lemonade.

The problem states that you need to buy at least L liters of lemonade using bottles of n different volumes, where the volume of type i is \(2^i - 1\) liters, and you have to minimize the total cost spent on the bottles.

The program defines a function `func_1` which:

1. Initializes a dynamic programming (dp) array to hold the minimum costs for bottles of different types.
2. Populates the dp array with the costs of the available bottle types and the costs of obtaining volumes via combinations of those bottles.
3. It then iterates from the maximum volume down to 0, checking if the remaining volume \(L\) can be fulfilled using the available bottles while keeping track of the costs.

However, we should consider if the logic covers all scenarios. A potential oversight is in the management of the final liters required after utilizing the largest available bottles.

Let's explore an edge case:

&nbsp;  
**Test Case:**  
Input:  
```
1 1
100
```
Expected Output: `100`

**Analysis of the provided code for this case:**  
- The program will initialize only one type of bottle:
  - Volume = \(2^0 - 1 = 0\) liters.
  - Cost = `100 roubles`.
- The first iteration in the loop checks:
  - For \(L = 1\) (the required liters), it will not have a valid bottle type to fulfill this requirement (as the available type yields no volume).
- Hence, it does not properly handle the case where only one bottle type cannot meet the volume requirement.

Since it fails for this scenario and doesn't aggregate the costs correctly or report a feasible method to buy the required liters (because no volume option is provided), the program does not meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` (between 1 and 30), an integer `L` (between 1 and 10^9), and a list `costs` of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^9). It computes a minimum cost based on dynamic programming, adjusting costs according to specific rules. The function returns the minimum value between `max_cost` and `current_cost`, where `current_cost` is derived from the accumulated `dp` values based on the powers of two that fit within `L`. Notably, if `L` is zero before adding any `dp[i]`, the function may still return `max_cost` if `current_cost` is zero or less than any applicable modifications. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
