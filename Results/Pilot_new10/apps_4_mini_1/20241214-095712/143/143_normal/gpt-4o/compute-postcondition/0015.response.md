The code updates `dp[i]` by assigning it the minimum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. Since `i` is 31, the calculation involves the value of `dp[31]` and `dp[30]`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The initial constraints indicate that `n` is between 1 and 30, so it does not affect the state related to `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `i` is 31; `dp[31]` is updated to min(dp[31], dp[30] * 2)**
