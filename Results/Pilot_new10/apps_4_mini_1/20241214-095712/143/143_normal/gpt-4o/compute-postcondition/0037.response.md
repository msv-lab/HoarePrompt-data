The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. 

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive.
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

After executing the function body, it returns the minimum of the initial `max_cost` and `current_cost`. Here, `current_cost` is calculated as the sum of relevant `dp[i]` values based on the decremented `L`. The `dp[i]` values for `i` in the range from 1 to 30 are adjusted to take into account the minimum of their original value and twice the value of `dp[i - 1]`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, an integer `L`, and a list of integers `costs`, and then return the minimum value between the initial maximum cost and a computed current cost derived from dynamic programming adjustments based on `L`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 30), L (an integer between 1 and 10^9), and costs (a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^9), and returns the minimum of the initial max_cost and the current_cost based on computed dp values.**
