According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is between 2 and 30 inclusive, meaning that the loop can execute again because `i` is currently less than `n`. 

For the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be at least 2 (which it is, since `n` is between 2 and 30).

State: **`n` is between 2 and 30 inclusive, `i` is 2, `dp[i]` is the minimum of its previous value and `c[i]`**
