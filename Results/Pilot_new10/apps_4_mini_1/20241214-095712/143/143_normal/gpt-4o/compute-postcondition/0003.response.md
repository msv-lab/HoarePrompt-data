In this scenario, the parameters affecting the loop execution include the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop is structured to iterate from `0` to `n-1`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least `1` (as specified: `n` is an integer between `1` and `30` inclusive), the loop will execute at least once.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` needs to be initialized to `0`, which is the first value in the range for the given loop. The variable `costs` will access its elements by the index `i`, which starts at `0`.

Thus, the needed adjustments incorporate the initial values of `i`, which determines the starting point of the loop, and restating the requirements for `n`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive, `i` is 0**
