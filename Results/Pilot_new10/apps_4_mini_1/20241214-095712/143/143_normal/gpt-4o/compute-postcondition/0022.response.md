The variable `L` is decremented by `1 << i`, which is equal to `2^i` or `1` shifted left by `i`. Since `i` is `30`, `1 << i` equals `2^30`. Therefore, the new value of `L` will be `L - 2^30`. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `n` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `n + 1` to `31` is 10; `answer` is equal to `max_cost`; `current_cost` is equal to `dp[30]`; `i` is 30; `L` is equal to the previous value of `L` minus `2^30`.**
