Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `30` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `31` is 10. If `L` is greater than or equal to `2^29`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[29]` and `L` is updated to `L - 2^29`; otherwise, `current_cost` remains unchanged and `L` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is equal to 29. The value of `answer` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`.***
