According to the code, the loop executes based on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since `n` can be between 1 and 30, `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 30 inclusive, `i` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `c[i]`**
