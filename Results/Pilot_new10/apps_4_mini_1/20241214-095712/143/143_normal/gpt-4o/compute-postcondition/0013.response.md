In this code snippet, `dp[i]` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and double the value of `dp[i - 1]`. The initial state specifies that `n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive, which implies that `i` will take values from 2 to 31 (since `i` is `n + 1`).

- The existing value of `dp[i]` could either be higher or lower than `dp[i - 1] * 2`, but after executing the code, `dp[i]` will be updated to the smaller of the two values.

Thus, the output state includes:
1. `n` remains between 1 and 30 inclusive.
2. `i` is still `n + 1`, which is greater than `n`.
3. The value of `dp[i]` now depends on the minimum calculation.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `i` is `n + 1`; `dp[i]` is updated to min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)**
