The variable `j` is equal to 2, so we calculate `vol` as `2 ** j - 1`, which equals `2 ** 2 - 1` = `4 - 1` = `3`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `dp[0]` is 0; `dp[1]` is equal to the minimum of all `costs[j]`; `j` is 2; `vol` is 3**.
