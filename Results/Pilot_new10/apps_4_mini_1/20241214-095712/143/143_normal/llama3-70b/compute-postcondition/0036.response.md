The variable `vol` is calculated as `2 ** j - 1`. The value of `j` is initially 0, thus `2 ** j` evaluates to `2 ** 0`, which equals 1. Therefore, `vol` becomes `1 - 1`, resulting in `vol` being 0. The other variables and states remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[i]` contains the minimum cost to fill the volume `i`, `j` is 0, and `vol` is 0.**
