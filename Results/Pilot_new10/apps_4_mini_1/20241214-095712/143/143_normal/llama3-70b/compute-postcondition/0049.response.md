Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp[0]` is 0, and for all `i` from 1 to `L`, `dp[i]` contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume `i` based on the available volumes derived from `vol = 2^j - 1` for `j` in the range from `0` to `n - 1`. If no valid volume was found for a particular `i`, then `dp[i]` remains float('inf').**
