According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`, which will increase by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. 

State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers converted from input where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is equal to `min(costs[0], costs[1])`, and all other `dp` values remain float('inf'), where `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `vol` is 1, provided `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.**
