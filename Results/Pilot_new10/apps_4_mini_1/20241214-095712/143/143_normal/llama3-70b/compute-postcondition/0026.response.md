The variable `vol` is assigned the value of \( 2^j - 1 \). The initial state does not specify the value of `j`, so we cannot determine an exact numeric value for `vol`, but we can express it in terms of `j`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `vol` is now defined, and other variables retain their original properties.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is equal to the minimum of all `costs[j]`, `j` is 1, `vol` is equal to \(2^j - 1\)**.
