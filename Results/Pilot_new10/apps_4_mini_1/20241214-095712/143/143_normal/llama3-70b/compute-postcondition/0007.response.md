Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers converted from input with each `costs[i]` satisfying 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp` is a list of size `L + 1` where dp[0] is now 0 and all other elements remain float('inf'), `i` is initialized to 1, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0, and the current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.***
