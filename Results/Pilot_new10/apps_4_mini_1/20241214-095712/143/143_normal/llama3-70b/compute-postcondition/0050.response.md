The provided code checks the value of `dp[L]` and prints it if it is not equal to `float('inf')`, otherwise it prints `-1`. The impact of the code is that it assesses whether a valid cost to achieve the volume `L` was found. 

Since no calculations are performed or values modified in `dp` within this snippet, the only change is in the output based on the value of `dp[L]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[L]` is either its current value or -1 if it equals float('inf').**
