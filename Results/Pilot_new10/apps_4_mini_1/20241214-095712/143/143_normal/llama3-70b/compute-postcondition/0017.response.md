Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp[0]` is 0, and `dp[1]` is equal to `min(costs[0], costs[1])`. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[2]` is set to float('inf'); otherwise, `dp[2]` remains float('inf'). All other `dp` values remain float('inf').***
