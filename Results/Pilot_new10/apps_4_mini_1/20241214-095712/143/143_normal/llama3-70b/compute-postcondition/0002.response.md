The code initializes the variable `dp` as a list of size `L + 1`, where each element is set to `float('inf')`. The value of `L` comes from the initial state, which is an input positive integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\). Since `L` is a positive integer, `dp` will contain `L + 1` elements, all initialized to infinity.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `L`, `c`, and `costs`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State should summarize the condition of the unchanged variables and specify the state of `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `c` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of `n` integers converted from input with each `costs[i]` satisfying 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9; `dp` is a list of size `L + 1`, where each element is initialized to float('inf').**
