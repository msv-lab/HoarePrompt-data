Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z`, each within the range [0.1, 200.0] with one digit after the decimal point. It calculates 12 different power expressions involving these three numbers and identifies the expression that results in the maximum value. The function then prints the corresponding mathematical expression associated with that maximum value. The function does not explicitly return any value. **
