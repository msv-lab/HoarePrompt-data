The program is correct based on the given problem description. 

Here's the breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three space-separated real numbers \( x, y, z \) from the input, ensuring that they are floats, which corresponds to the problem's requirement of handling positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0].

2. **Expression Calculation**: The program calculates all 12 defined expressions \( a_1 \) to \( a_{12} \) as required by the problem. The expressions are accurately computed using Python's exponentiation operator, following the mathematical definitions provided.

3. **Finding Maximum**: The program finds the maximum of the calculated expressions and identifies the smallest index corresponding to this maximum value. The use of `a.index(max(a))` ensures that it picks the first expression in case of ties, adhering to the problem's instructions.

4. **Output Format**: The corresponding expression is printed in the required format, ensuring that the expressions are formatted as specified (e.g., `x^y^z` for \( x^{y}^{z} \) and `(x^y)^z` for \( (x^{y})^{z} \)). This formatting directly follows the output conditions stated in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**: The problem description includes a guarantee of correctness by stating that the inputs are always valid (within the specified range and format). Hence, the program does not need to handle invalid inputs, simplifying the verification aspect.

Since the program faithfully implements the operations and requirements outlined in the problem description without omissions or errors, the correctness of the program can be confidently affirmed.

Correctness: **True**
