The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` will be assigned new values based on the input received via `sys.stdin.read()`, which is processed through the `map` function to convert the input strings into floats. The ranges provided indicate that each of these values will still remain in the bounds of 0.1 to 200.0 after assignment. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are now replaced by new values based on the formatted input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are newly assigned positive real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0, each given with exactly one digit after the decimal point, based on the input.**
