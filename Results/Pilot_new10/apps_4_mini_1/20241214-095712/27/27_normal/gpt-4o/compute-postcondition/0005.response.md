The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Based on the output provided, it handles the processing of the input values `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are positive real numbers that each have exactly one digit after the decimal point and are within the range of 0.1 to 200.0. The function will return some value based on the logic incorporated within it, but this is not detailed in the provided information. 

Therefore, since there are no specific conditions or returns mentioned, we only note that the function is working with these predefined constraints for variables.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on positive real numbers x, y, and z within the range of 0.1 to 200.0, returning a value based on some internal logic.**
