Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly because it uses `sys.stdin.read` but does not import the `sys` module, which would lead to an error when attempting to read input. Furthermore, it doesn't account for the possibility of having multiple maximum values as described in the problem statement; it only fetches the first maximal value using Python's `max` function without checking for ties and their corresponding indices.

Additionally, the output format for expressions needs to be handled specifically when parentheses are involved. There may be cases where the program could select the wrong expression format to print based on the maximum value derived. The print statements use only the expression string without ensuring the output precisely follows the described format when handling different expressions with and without parentheses.

Due to these issues, the program fails to meet all the requirements stated in the problem description.
