The code takes input in the form of two integers representing the dimensions of a monitor (n and m). These integers are mapped to the variables `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`. There are no additional variables affected directly by this line of code, but we can conclude that `n` and `m` will now hold the respective integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is assigned an input integer representing the number of lines, `m` is assigned an input integer representing the number of characters in each line (1 â‰¤ n, m â‰¤ 2000)**
