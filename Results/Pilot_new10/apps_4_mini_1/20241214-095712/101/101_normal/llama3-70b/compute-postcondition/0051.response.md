Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '.', and the variable `i` remains neither `min_x` nor `max_x`, and `j` remains neither `min_y` nor `max_y`.***
