According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` must be set to 2. Since `m` is greater than 0, it allows for at least 2 iterations.

State: **`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2.**
