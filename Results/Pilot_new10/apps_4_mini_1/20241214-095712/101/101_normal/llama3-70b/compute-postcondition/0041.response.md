Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` remains either `min_x` or `max_x`; `m` is greater than `max_y`; `j` has incremented through its range, potentially reaching `max_y`; `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '+' where the conditions were met and remains as '.' or potentially 'w' in other positions, reflecting the pixel states after all iterations have completed.**
