Given the initial state:

- `n` is assigned
- `m` is assigned
- `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters
- `white_pixels` must have at least 3 tuples
- `(x, y)` is the third tuple in the list
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` must be the updated values after processing the first two tuples.

The line of code provided updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` based on the current values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `x`, and `y`.

Therefore, `min_x` becomes the minimum of the current `min_x` or `x`, and `min_y` becomes the minimum of the current `min_y` or `y`. The previous affecting variables are `min_x`, `min_y`, `x`, and `y`, where `x` and `y` represent the coordinates of the third tuple.

Assuming the values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `x`, and `y` are not specified but can be represented by their current values before the code execution, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` must have at least 3 tuples, (x, y) is the third tuple in the list; `min_x` is updated to min(min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(min_y, y)**
