To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we examine the provided information.

1. At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` is greater than `max_x`
   - `i` is `max_x + 1`
   - `m` is greater than 0
   - `j` is 0.

2. The `for` loop iterates over `j` in the range of `m`, which means it will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`.

3. Since `m` is greater than 0, `j` starts at 0, and for the loop to execute again, we must increment `j` by 1.

4. Therefore, at the beginning of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 1. Since there is no indication that any other variables (`i` or the content of `pixels`) are changing in such a way that would affect the loop's condition, they remain unchanged.

Hence, the adjusted state must reflect that `j` has been incremented to 1 while all other states remain the same.

State: **`n` is greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1**
