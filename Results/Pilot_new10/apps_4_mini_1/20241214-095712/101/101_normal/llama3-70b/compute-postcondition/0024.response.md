The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since there are no other changes to the values of the variables in this snippet, the values remain the same, though we are effectively skipping processing for the current combination of `i` and `j`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and it is not true that ((i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.'), and the current value of pixels[i][j] is 'w', and we skip the current loop iteration.**
