According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1 (as the range of `j` starts from 0 and goes up to, but not including, `m`). The current state indicates that `j` is between 0 and `m-1`, but if `m` is 0, then `j` would not have any valid values for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

Additionally, the state indicates `n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, which doesn't affect the execution of the loop.

In conclusion, the necessary adjustments would be:
- `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `j` should be set to 0, the initial value in the range of the loop.

State: **`n is greater than max_x + 2`, `i is max_x + 2`, `m must be greater than 0`, `j is 0`, `pixels[i][j]` has been updated accordingly**
