The code snippet assigns the value `'.'` to the position `pixels[i][j]`. The variables `i` and `j` are defined as either `min_x` or `max_x` and either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`, respectively. The array `pixels` is being modified based on these indices, and there is no change to the values of `n`, `m`, or the other variables stated in the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`, `m` is greater than `max_y`, `j` is either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`, and `pixels[i][j]` is '.'**
