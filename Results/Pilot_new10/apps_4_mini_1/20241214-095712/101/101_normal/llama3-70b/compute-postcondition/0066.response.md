According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `max_x + 1`, and since `n` is greater than `max_x`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `max_x + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `max_x + 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is between 0 and `m-1`, and `pixels[i][j]` has been updated accordingly.**
