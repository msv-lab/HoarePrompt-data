The code assigns the value `'+'` to the element at position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` matrix. The variable `i` is equal to `max_x + 2`, and `j` is equal to `2`. Since `n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, it does not affect the matrix assignment, but it indicates that `i` may index an appropriate range within `pixels`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `pixels[i][j]` is '+'**.
