The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue to the next iteration. In this case, it does not change the values of any of the variables. Instead, it simply instructs the loop to proceed to the next cycle.

The variables `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged as `continue` does not modify them.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`; `m` is greater than `max_y + 1`; and `j` is either `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2`.**
