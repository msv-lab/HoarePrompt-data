Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`, `m` is greater than `max_y`, and `j` is either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', we skip the current iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is '.', indicating that the current iteration continues with the assumption that `pixels[i][j]` is not 'w'.***
