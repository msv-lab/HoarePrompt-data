The code calculates the `frame_size` based on the maximum distance between the x and y coordinates of the white pixels. The values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unaffected, while `frame_size` is assigned the calculated value.

Therefore, `frame_size` is calculated as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. Given that `max_x`, `min_x`, `max_y`, and `min_y` represent specific coordinates of the white pixels, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` contains all tuples `(x, y)` for each position where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all white pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all white pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all white pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all white pixels, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.**
