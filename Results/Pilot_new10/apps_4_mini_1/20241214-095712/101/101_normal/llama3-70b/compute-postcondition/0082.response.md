Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. If either `i` is equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, `j` is equal to `min_y`, or `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `pixels[max_x + 2][1]` is set to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', we continue to the next iteration of the loop; if `pixels[i][j]` is not 'w', then `pixels[max_x + 2][1]` is set to '.'***
