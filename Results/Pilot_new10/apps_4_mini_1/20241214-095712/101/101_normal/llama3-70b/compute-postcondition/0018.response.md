For the loop to execute successfully, we need to ensure that `n` is a non-negative integer because the range function will iterate `n` times. Therefore, it must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute at least once. As `i` is initialized by the `for` statement, its initial value will be 0 at the first iteration.

Given that the provided states contain all necessary information about the state of variables before the loop begins, we can summarize the requirements for the loop to run.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0**
