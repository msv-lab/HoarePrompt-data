The values of `min_x` and `min_y` are updated to the minimum of their respective current values and the values of `x` and `y`. The specific previous values of `min_x` and `min_y` are not provided, but their new values will be either the current values if `x` and `y` are greater or the values of `x` and `y` if they are lesser. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` must have at least 2 tuples, `min_x` is updated to min(min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(min_y, y)**
