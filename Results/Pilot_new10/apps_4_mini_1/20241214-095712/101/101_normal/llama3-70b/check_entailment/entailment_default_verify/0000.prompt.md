You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
    (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) = (float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf'))
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        (min_x, min_y) = (min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y))
        (max_x, max_y) = (max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y))
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if frame_size > max(n, m):
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and consider various potential edge cases.

1. The program starts by reading the dimensions of the monitor and the pixel states. It constructs a list of coordinates for the white pixels (`'w'`).
   
2. It calculates the minimum and maximum rows and columns that contain white pixels to determine the bounds of the frame.

3. The program then calculates the size of the frame based on the maximum of the width and height of the bounding box around the white pixels. It adds 1 to account for the frame width.

4. A check is made to see if the calculated frame size exceeds the dimensions of the monitor. If it does, it outputs `-1`, indicating that a valid frame cannot be drawn without exceeding the monitor's limits.

5. The program attempts to paint the frame using `'+'` characters only on the outer border, ensuring that it respects the positions of the white pixels. It replaces black pixels (`'.'`) with `'+'` only at the frame locations.

6. Finally, it prints out the modified pixel grid.

**Edge Cases Consideration:**
- If there are wide gaps between white pixels, thus making it impossible to form a continuous frame, the program doesn't seem to check if there are white pixels in the corners or along the frame requirements, which may lead to cases where the output is incorrect.
- Consider a case where the white pixels are far apart but form a diagonal line, which the current frame creation logic does not properly handle.
- In the case when the frame can only be of size 1 (i.e., there is only one white pixel), the program will correctly print a single pixel `'w'`, but if there is no surrounding frame, it won’t accurately determine that a frame is too small to draw.

Here’s a consideration for why the code may fail:

**Test Case Example:**
```
Input:
3 5
.....
.w...
.....
```
For this input:
- The only white pixel is located at (1, 1). 
- The program would determine that a frame of size 1 is sufficient and would replace `'.'` with `'+'` around (1, 1) incorrectly since it can't surround it at all because the frame can't extend out beyond the screen dimensions.

The output is incorrect because it should return `-1` for cases where forming a frame isn't possible.

Therefore, since the code does not handle such cases correctly, it fails to meet the problem requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a monitor grid, and a grid of pixels where each pixel is either a black ('.') or white ('w') pixel. It identifies the bounding box of the white pixels in the grid. If the size of this bounding box exceeds the dimensions of the grid (either `n` or `m`), the function prints -1. Otherwise, it modifies the border of the bounding box of white pixels by replacing black pixels on the border with '+' and prints the modified grid. If there are no changes to be made due to the size constraint, it simply prints the original grid. The function does not handle the case where the dimensions `n` or `m` are 0, as this would lead to invalid input based on the provided constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
