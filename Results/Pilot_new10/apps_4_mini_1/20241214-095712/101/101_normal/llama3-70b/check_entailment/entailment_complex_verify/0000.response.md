The original assessment correctly identified that the program might not handle certain edge cases, particularly when dealing with arrays of white pixels that don't form a continuous frame. Given the constraints of the problem, the annotations provided further clarify that while the program runs smoothly for many inputs, it does not account for scenarios where a valid frame is not possible due to the arrangement of white pixels. 

The crucial part is that a frame must be continuous and surround the white pixels correctly. In the annotated version of the code, the logic for determining and drawing the frame doesn't specifically check that the frame conforms to the required properties in all cases, which leads to potentially incorrect outputs. 

Therefore, my assessment aligns with the original evaluation: the program lacks the necessary checks to confirm that a valid frame can actually be created for all potential white pixel arrangements.

Final: **False**.
