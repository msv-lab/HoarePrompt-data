You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
    (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) = (float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf'))
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        (min_x, min_y) = (min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y))
        (max_x, max_y) = (max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y))
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if frame_size > max(n, m):
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and consider various potential edge cases.

1. The program starts by reading the dimensions of the monitor and the pixel states. It constructs a list of coordinates for the white pixels (`'w'`).
   
2. It calculates the minimum and maximum rows and columns that contain white pixels to determine the bounds of the frame.

3. The program then calculates the size of the frame based on the maximum of the width and height of the bounding box around the white pixels. It adds 1 to account for the frame width.

4. A check is made to see if the calculated frame size exceeds the dimensions of the monitor. If it does, it outputs `-1`, indicating that a valid frame cannot be drawn without exceeding the monitor's limits.

5. The program attempts to paint the frame using `'+'` characters only on the outer border, ensuring that it respects the positions of the white pixels. It replaces black pixels (`'.'`) with `'+'` only at the frame locations.

6. Finally, it prints out the modified pixel grid.

**Edge Cases Consideration:**
- If there are wide gaps between white pixels, thus making it impossible to form a continuous frame, the program doesn't seem to check if there are white pixels in the corners or along the frame requirements, which may lead to cases where the output is incorrect.
- Consider a case where the white pixels are far apart but form a diagonal line, which the current frame creation logic does not properly handle.
- In the case when the frame can only be of size 1 (i.e., there is only one white pixel), the program will correctly print a single pixel `'w'`, but if there is no surrounding frame, it won’t accurately determine that a frame is too small to draw.

Here’s a consideration for why the code may fail:

**Test Case Example:**
```
Input:
3 5
.....
.w...
.....
```
For this input:
- The only white pixel is located at (1, 1). 
- The program would determine that a frame of size 1 is sufficient and would replace `'.'` with `'+'` around (1, 1) incorrectly since it can't surround it at all because the frame can't extend out beyond the screen dimensions.

The output is incorrect because it should return `-1` for cases where forming a frame isn't possible.

Therefore, since the code does not handle such cases correctly, it fails to meet the problem requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000) representing the resolution of the monitor, followed by n lines of m characters each, where each character is either '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel). It is guaranteed that at least one pixel is a white pixel.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] ==
    'w']
    min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float(
    '-inf')
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
        
        max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` contains all tuples `(x, y)` for each position where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all white pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all white pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all white pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all white pixels.
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if (frame_size > max(n, m)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j
                    ] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pixels` contains symbols where:
        #- Each pixel boundary defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` has been updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.
        #- Pixels corresponding to 'w' remain unchanged.
        #- All other pixels have been converted to '.'.
        #- If `n` is 0, `pixels` is an empty list.
        #- If `m` is 0, `pixels` would consist of empty strings for each row, reflecting dimensions, while no changes occur to content since there are no iterations possible.
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pixels` is a list of `n` non-empty rows, where each row is a string formed by concatenating its elements, `n` is greater than 0, and `m` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, `pixels` is an empty list. If `m` is 0, `pixels` consists of empty strings for each row, reflecting dimensions.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are assigned values, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, and `white_pixels` contains all tuples `(x, y)` for each position where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'. If the `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `pixels` remains a list of `n` non-empty rows, where each row is a string formed by concatenating its elements, with `n` greater than 0 and `m` greater than 0, reflecting the dimensional properties, or may be an empty list if `n` is 0, or consist of empty strings for each row if `m` is 0.
