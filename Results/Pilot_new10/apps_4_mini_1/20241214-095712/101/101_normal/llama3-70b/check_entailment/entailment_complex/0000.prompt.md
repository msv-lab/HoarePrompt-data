You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

In the first sample the required size of the optimal frame equals 4. In the second sample the size of the optimal frame equals 3. In the third sample, the size of the optimal frame is 1. In the fourth sample, the required frame doesn't exist.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000) representing the resolution of the monitor, followed by n lines of m characters each, where each character is either '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel). It is guaranteed that at least one pixel is a white pixel.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] ==
    'w']
    min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float(
    '-inf')
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
        
        max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` contains all tuples `(x, y)` for each position where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all white pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all white pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all white pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all white pixels.
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if (frame_size > max(n, m)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j
                    ] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pixels` contains symbols where:
        #- Each pixel boundary defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` has been updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.
        #- Pixels corresponding to 'w' remain unchanged.
        #- All other pixels have been converted to '.'.
        #- If `n` is 0, `pixels` is an empty list.
        #- If `m` is 0, `pixels` would consist of empty strings for each row, reflecting dimensions, while no changes occur to content since there are no iterations possible.
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pixels` is a list of `n` non-empty rows, where each row is a string formed by concatenating its elements, `n` is greater than 0, and `m` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, `pixels` is an empty list. If `m` is 0, `pixels` consists of empty strings for each row, reflecting dimensions.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are assigned values, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, and `white_pixels` contains all tuples `(x, y)` for each position where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'. If the `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `pixels` remains a list of `n` non-empty rows, where each row is a string formed by concatenating its elements, with `n` greater than 0 and `m` greater than 0, reflecting the dimensional properties, or may be an empty list if `n` is 0, or consist of empty strings for each row if `m` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a monitor grid, and a grid of pixels where each pixel is either a black ('.') or white ('w') pixel. It identifies the bounding box of the white pixels in the grid. If the size of this bounding box exceeds the dimensions of the grid (either `n` or `m`), the function prints -1. Otherwise, it modifies the border of the bounding box of white pixels by replacing black pixels on the border with '+' and prints the modified grid. If there are no changes to be made due to the size constraint, it simply prints the original grid. The function does not handle the case where the dimensions `n` or `m` are 0, as this would lead to invalid input based on the provided constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
