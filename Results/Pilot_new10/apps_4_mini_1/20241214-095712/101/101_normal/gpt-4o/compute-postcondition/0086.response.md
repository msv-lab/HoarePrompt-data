The value of `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently set to 1. Since `i` does not change and `top` is directly assigned from it, `top` will also become 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `bottom` remains 1, `top` is 1, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `j` is 2, `screen[1][0]` remains 'w'**
