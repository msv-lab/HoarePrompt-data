Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `top` is None, then `top` and `bottom` are both set to 0, and `left` is updated to 1 with `right` also updated to 1. If `top` is not None, `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` remains None, `left` remains 1, and if `j` is not greater than `right`, the state remains unchanged.***
