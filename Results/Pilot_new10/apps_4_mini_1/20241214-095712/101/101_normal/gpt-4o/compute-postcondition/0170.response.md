Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen` where all positions on the boundaries defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` that originally contained '.' are set to '+'. If `result[i][j]` is not '.', it remains unchanged. The loop executes for every value of `j` from `left` to `right`, ensuring the boundaries of `result` are modified as described. If the range of `j` is empty due to `right < left`, no modifications to `result` occur.**
