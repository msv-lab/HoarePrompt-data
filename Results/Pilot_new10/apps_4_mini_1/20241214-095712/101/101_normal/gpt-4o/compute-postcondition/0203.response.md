Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, and `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen`, where all positions on the boundaries defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` that originally contained '.' are set to '+'. All other positions in `result` remain unchanged. The loop executes until `i` is greater than `bottom` and all boundary cells within the specified ranges have been processed.**
