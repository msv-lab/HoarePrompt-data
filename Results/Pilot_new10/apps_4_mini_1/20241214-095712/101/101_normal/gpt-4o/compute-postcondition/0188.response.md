According to the code, the for loop utilizes the variable `j` to iterate from `left` to `right + 1`. For the loop to execute, the range defined by `left` and `right` must include at least one integer; that is, `right` must be greater than or equal to `left`. Given that `left` is an integer and `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, this condition will be satisfied as per the provided state.

Before the loop starts, the value of `j` needs to be set to the first position of the range being iterated upon, which is `left`. Since the loop is iterating through `left` to `right + 1`, the initial value of `j` is effectively `left`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `j` starts at `left`.

State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top + 1`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen`, where every position `(i, j)` such that `i == top` or `i == bottom` or `j == left` or `j == right` that was originally '.' is now updated to '+', maintaining unchanged positions for other elements in `result`, and `j` is equal to `left`.**
