The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 1. The value of `j` is unchanged, and since the values of the other variables are not affected, their states remain as they were. The conditions regarding `i` and `bottom` are not impacted by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 1, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 1, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, `j` is 1.**
