The code assigns the value `'+'` to the position `result[i][j]`. Given that `i` is equal to `top + 1` and `j` is equal to `left`, the character at this specific position in `result` is now changed. The states of other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top + 1`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen` with the character at position `result[top + 1][left]` now being '+', `i` is still `top + 1`, `j` is still `left`.**
