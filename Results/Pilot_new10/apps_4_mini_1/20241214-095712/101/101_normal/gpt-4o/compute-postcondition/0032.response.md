Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is None, `left` is 1, and `right` is 1. If `j` is greater than `right`, the state is unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged because `j` is not greater than `right`.***
