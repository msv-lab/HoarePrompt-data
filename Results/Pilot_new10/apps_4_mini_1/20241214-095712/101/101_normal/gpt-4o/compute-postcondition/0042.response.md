`left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged since the conditions regarding `i` and `bottom` have not changed the state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, and `left` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, and `left` is 2.**
