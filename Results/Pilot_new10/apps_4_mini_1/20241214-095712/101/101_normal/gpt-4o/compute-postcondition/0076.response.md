Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i`, `top`, and `bottom` are all 1. If `i > bottom` holds true, the conditions of `left` and `right` remain intact, while the value of `i` would stay equal to `top`. If `i` is not greater than `bottom`, then the states of the variables remain unchanged.***
