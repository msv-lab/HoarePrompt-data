Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to 0. Otherwise, `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is None, `left` is 0, and if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to 0; otherwise, `right` remains unchanged.***
