According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `top` is the minimum row index of 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w', `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w'.**
