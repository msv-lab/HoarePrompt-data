Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `top` is 1, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `j` is 2, and `screen[1][0]` remains 'w'. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `left` and `right` are updated to 2. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `j` is greater than `right`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `right`, the program remains unchanged and `screen[1][0]` continues to be 'w'.***
