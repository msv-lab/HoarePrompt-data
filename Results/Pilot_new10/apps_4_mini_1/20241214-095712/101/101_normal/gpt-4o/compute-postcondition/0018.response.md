The value of `right` is assigned to the value of `j`, which is 0. Since the current value of `j` is greater than `right` initially, it implies that this condition is no longer valid after the assignment, as `right` now holds the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `top` is not None, `bottom` is None, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
