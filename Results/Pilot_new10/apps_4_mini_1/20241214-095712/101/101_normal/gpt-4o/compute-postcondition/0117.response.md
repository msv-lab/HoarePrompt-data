Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, and `j` is either 0 (if it was previously greater than `right`) or retains its original value (if it was not). Additionally, `screen[2][0]` is 'w'.***
