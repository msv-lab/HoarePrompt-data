To determine the state at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the state variables are affected by the loop and the conditions given.

Given:
- `n` is an integer ≥ 1
- `m` is an integer ≥ 1
- `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0 and is currently being used to index into the `screen` list.
- We are operating on the variable `j` in the loop.

Inside the loop:
- The loop is iterating over the range `m`, which means it will execute `m` times for `j` values ranging from 0 to `m - 1`.
- The current value of `j` is 0.
- For the loop to execute again, the value of `j` needs to increase by 1 for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, if `j` is 0, after the current iteration `j` will be increased to 1 for the next iteration.

State update considerations:
- The variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` will be unaffected by this specific increment of `j` as they are dependent on conditions evaluated during the current iteration and not on `j` directly.
  
Thus, since `j` will increase by 1 to 1, and there's no condition altering other variables based on the current state (as `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` either remain unchanged or update conditionally), we get:

State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is None, `left` is set to 0, and if 0 is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to 0; otherwise, `right` remains unchanged.**
