Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then if `top` is None, `left` and `right` are set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to the value of `j`; in either case, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.***
