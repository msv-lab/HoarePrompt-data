The variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 2. The previous value of `top` is not known but it is not None, and `i` is less than `top`. No other variables are affected by this assignment, so the output state will reflect the new value of `top`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' encountered, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' encountered, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, `j` is 0, the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w', and the current value of `i` is less than the previous value of `top`.**
