Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, and `bottom` is 0. If `j` is less than `left` (which is 2), the function maintains the same values and relationships of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, and `bottom`. If `j` is not less than `left`, the values remain unchanged as `j` equals 2 and `left` also equals 2.***
