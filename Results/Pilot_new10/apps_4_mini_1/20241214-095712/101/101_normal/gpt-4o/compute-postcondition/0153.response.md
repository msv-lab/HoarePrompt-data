Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` are all integers, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, and `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`. Both `frame_height` and `frame_width` are greater than or equal to 2.***
