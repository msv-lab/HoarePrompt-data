Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is None, `left` is 0, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `right` remains unchanged. If `i` is not greater than `bottom`, then `right` also remains unchanged.***
