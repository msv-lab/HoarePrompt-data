Output State: **`result` is a 2D array where positions `(top, j)` and `(bottom, j)` for `j` in the range `[left, right]`, as well as positions `(i, left)` and `(i, right)` for `i` in the range `[top, bottom]`, are updated to '+' if they were originally '.', maintaining unchanged positions for all other elements in `result`. The dimensions of `result` correspond to `n` rows and `m` columns as initialized, with `i` set to `bottom + 1` after the loop executes, indicating no further updates to `result` can occur for that value of `i`.`**
