The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous value of `j` is 0, so `left` will now also be 0. The other variables remain unchanged since this assignment does not impact them. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `top` is not None, `bottom` is None, `left` is 0, `right` is None, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and `j` is less than `left`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, the conditions remain unchanged.**
