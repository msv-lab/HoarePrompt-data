The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. However, `j` hasn't been defined in the initial state. The conditions regarding `i` don't directly affect the assignment of `left`. Therefore, since `j` is unknown, we cannot determine an exact value for `left`.

The remaining values of the variables are unchanged. Thus, the Output State will reflect the unchanged values along with the assignment of `left`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i`, `top`, and `bottom` are all 1, and `left` is equal to `j`, where `j` is undefined.**
