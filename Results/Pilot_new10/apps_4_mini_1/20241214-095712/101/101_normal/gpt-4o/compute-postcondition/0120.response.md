The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given that the initial value of `j` is 1, both `left` and `right` will now be assigned the value 1.

Before executing the code:
- `left` is 0
- `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered (unknown, but initially must be ≥ 0)
- `j` is 1

After executing the code:
- `left` becomes 1
- `right` also becomes 1, replacing its previous unknown value.

The remaining variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `j` is 1**.
