Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `top` is not None, `bottom` is None, `left` is 0, `right` is at least 0. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to 0. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.***
