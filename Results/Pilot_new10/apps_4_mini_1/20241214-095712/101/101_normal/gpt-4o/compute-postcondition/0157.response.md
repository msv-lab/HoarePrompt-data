Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen`, `i` is initialized to `top`, `j` is initialized to `left`. The current values of `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, and `j` is equal to `left` or `right`.***
