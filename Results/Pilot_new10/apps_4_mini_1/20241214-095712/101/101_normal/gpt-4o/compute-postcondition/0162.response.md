According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `left` to `right`, inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `left` initially, and the loop continues incrementing `j` until it reaches `right`. 

If `j` is currently at the value `right`, the loop cannot execute again as it would exceed the bounds set by `right`. However, if `j` is less than `right`, the loop can execute again. Since the loop starts at `left`, `j` will be incremented accordingly. 

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If `j` is incremented from its current value (which we assume is `left` for the last iteration), it will become `left + 1` for the next iteration.
- For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `right`. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `left + 1` is less than or equal to `right`.

State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen`, `j` is equal to `left + 1`**
