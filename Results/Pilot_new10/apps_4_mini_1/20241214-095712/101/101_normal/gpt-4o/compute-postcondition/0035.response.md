According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, allowing for potential further iterations. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 2, and it must be ensured that `j` is still less than `m`.

State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2**
