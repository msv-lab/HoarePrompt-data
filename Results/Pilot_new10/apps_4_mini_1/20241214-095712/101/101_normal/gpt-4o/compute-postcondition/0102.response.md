The variables `left`, `right`, and `j` are all assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 0. Thus, after executing this line of code, `left` and `right` will both become 0, since they will take the value of `j`. The other variables are not affected by this code execution. 

Given that `j` is 0 and the constraints on the other variables are maintained, the output state is: `n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and `j` is 0.**
