The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to both `top` and `bottom`. Thus, `top` and `bottom` will both become 2. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `left`, `right`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is undefined, `right` is undefined, `j` is 2**
