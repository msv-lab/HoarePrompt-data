The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to both `top` and `bottom`. As a result, `top` and `bottom` will both now be equal to 1, which they already were. The values of other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `left`, `right`, and `j`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `top` is 1, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `j` is 2, `screen[1][0]` remains 'w'**
