The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. There is no information given about the value of `j`, and since no other variables are affected, the output state remains mostly unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, the state remains unchanged because `i` is 1, which is not greater than `bottom` (1), and the current value of `j` is less than `left`; `left` is equal to `j`.**
