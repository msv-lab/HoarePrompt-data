Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' encountered, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' encountered, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, `j` is 0, and the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w'. If `i` is less than `top`, the conditions mentioned remain unchanged as the code inside the if block executes.***
