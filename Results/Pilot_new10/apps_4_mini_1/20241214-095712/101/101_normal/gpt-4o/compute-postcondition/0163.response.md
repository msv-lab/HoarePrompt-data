The code assigns the value `'+'` to the position `[i][j]` of the `result` list. The value of `j` is previously defined as `left + 1`, and the value of `i` remains unchanged. There are no changes to the other variables. Therefore, the output state will indicate that the character at position `[i][j]` has been changed to `+`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen`, `j` is equal to `left + 1`, and `result[i][j]` is updated to '+'**.
