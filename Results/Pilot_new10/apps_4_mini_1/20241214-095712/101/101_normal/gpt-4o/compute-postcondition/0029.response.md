The value of `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The variable `j` is equal to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is None, `left` is 1, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `right` remains unchanged; if `i` is not greater than `bottom`, then `right` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is None, `left` is 1, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `right` remains unchanged; if `i` is not greater than `bottom`, then `right` also remains unchanged.**
