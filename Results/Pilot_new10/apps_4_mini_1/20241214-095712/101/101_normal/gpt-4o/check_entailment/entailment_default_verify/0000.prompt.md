You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, m, screen)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    for row in result:
        print(''.join(row))

def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze the program step by step.

The program defines a function `func_1` that attempts to find the square frame around white pixels ('w') on a given monitor represented by a grid. The function aims to find the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost indices of white pixels in the grid and then create a frame using the '+' character.

1. The program initializes the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` as `None`.
2. It loops through the monitor's pixels, updating these variables based on the positions of the white pixels.
3. After identifying the boundaries of the frame, it checks if the frame dimensions are valid (if they are less than 2).
4. If the frame is valid, it modifies the grid to populate the frame with '+' characters.
5. Finally, the program either prints the modified grid or `-1` if a valid frame cannot be created.

### Potential Cases to Consider

1. **Insufficient Frame Size**: If we have an input where the only white pixels are adjacent to each other, making the frame size valid but the inner empty area must not be filled with '+' if it doesn't meet the required size of at least `2`.
2. **Multiple White Pixels Forming an Across Shape**: For example, if there are white pixels that could lead to multiple valid frames, the program may not honor the minimum required size properly. For instance:
    - Input:
      ```
      3 5
      .....
      .w.w.
      .....
      ```
      The expected output should be a frame of size 2 around the 'w' pixels, but the detection logic may not compute a viable frame since the outer area has '.' pixels.

3. **Single 'w' Pixel**: If there is only one 'w' pixel:
    - Input:
      ```
      3 3
      ...
      .w.
      ...
      ```
      The program should return `-1`, which it does not do correctly if it does not check for single pixel coverage properly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the function, we can see there are scenarios where the implementation does not adhere strictly to the problem requirements. Thus, the program could yield incorrect results for some configurations of white pixels.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen`, which represents a monitor resolution containing characters either '.' or 'w'. It returns -1 if 'w' is not found in the screen or if the resulting frame's height or width is less than 2. If 'w' is found, it returns a modified list, where all boundary positions composed of '.' within the identified rectangle defined by the outermost 'w' characters are replaced with '+', while all other positions remain unchanged. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
