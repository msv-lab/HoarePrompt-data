After analyzing the provided annotated version of the program in relation to the problem description and the original assessment, it becomes clear that the original assessment correctly identified potential flaws in the logic of the code. 

The function `func_1` is designed to find the smallest square frame of `'+'` characters that encapsulate all `'w'` pixels. However, the logic fails in certain situations:

1. The program checks if any of the boundary indices (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) are `None`, indicating that no white pixels were found. This check is valid.
  
2. It calculates the height and width of the frame based on these indices and then checks whether they are both at least `2`, which is necessary for forming a valid frame.

3. Problems arise in scenarios where there is only one white pixel or where multiple white pixels are not arranged to form a minimum frame size of `2` in either dimension. The program fails to capture valid frames correctly in these situations, leading to incorrect outputs when it should instead return `-1` for such cases.

4. The logic also does not handle situations where white pixels are located adjacent to the edges, which can lead to a non-existent frame. 

Given this analysis and the annotated state of the program showing the specific checks and balances (and their potential missing edge cases), the original assessment accurately identified that the program could yield incorrect results for certain configurations of white pixels.

Thus, I maintain the original assessment's conclusion regarding the correctness of the program.

Final: **False**
