You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, m, screen)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    for row in result:
        print(''.join(row))

def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    return result

Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic and check various cases against the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Code**:
   - The program reads the resolution of the monitor and the display state.
   - It then seeks to identify the bounding box of the white pixels ('w').
   - The algorithm calculates the top, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the white pixels.
   - If there are fewer than 2 pixels between the top and bottom or the left and right boundaries (i.e., frame height < 2 or frame width < 2), it returns -1, which indicates that a valid frame can't be constructed.
   - It attempts to draw a frame by replacing '.' with '+' along the borders of the rectangle defined by the identified boundaries.

2. **Identifying Potential Issues**:
   - The main logic flaw is in the condition to determine whether the frame can be drawn. If there's a single white pixel or if the identified rectangle is too small, the program quickly returns -1. However, note that any frame with a single pixel width (which contains another pixel within it) would still be considered valid; it does not always require a full rectangle.
   - The logic also does not consider edge cases where a single row or column has 'w' but is placed in such a way that a frame is technically possible. For example, it doesn't handle cases where 'w's might be present but spaced far to the edges, leaving a gap that still could allow for a frame.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the following grid:
     ```
     3 5
     .....
     .w...
     .w...
     ```
   - According to the description, a frame around these 'w's should be possible:
     ```
     ..+..
     +w+..
     +w+..
     ```
   - However, running the provided code would give -1, falsely claiming no valid frame exists since the top to bottom height is only 2.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program incorrectly handles cases where narrow frames could still be valid because it's overly restrictive in validating frame bounds.
   - Therefore, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, m, screen)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    for row in result:
        print(''.join(row))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the dimensions of the monitor resolution where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and screen is a list of strings with length n, where each string has a length of m containing characters either '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel).
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):

                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
