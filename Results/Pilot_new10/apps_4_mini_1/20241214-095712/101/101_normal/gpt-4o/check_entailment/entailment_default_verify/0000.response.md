After carefully analyzing the problem description, the provided code, the output hints, and the original assessment, the conclusion regarding the program's correctness can be reached.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program could yield incorrect results for certain configurations of white pixels. It outlines specific scenarios where the program does not properly handle cases as required by the problem statement, particularly focusing on the size of the frame under certain conditions and the handling of isolated white pixels.

The output hints further clarify the expected functionality of the `func_1` function. Specifically, they affirm that the function should return -1 if the frame size (height or width) is less than 2, which supports the assessment that the program will not work correctly under certain configurations.

Given the provided examples and the specifics of the problem, including requirements for frame size and characteristics, it's evident that there are cases where the program fails to produce the correct output. The program does not account for singular white pixels that need to be surrounded by a proper frame, thus returning incorrect outputs when it should return -1.

Therefore, I maintain that the original assessment is accurate. The program does not satisfy the conditions of the problem description under some configurations and is thus incorrect.

Final: **False**.
