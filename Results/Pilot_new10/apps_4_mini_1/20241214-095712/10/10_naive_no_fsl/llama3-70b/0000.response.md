To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic and functionality as compared to the problem statement. 

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads a number of sofas, the dimensions of the storehouse, the position coordinates of each sofa, and the expected counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks' sofa.

2. **Sofa Comparison Logic**: 
   - The `func_1` function compares each sofa with the other sofas to count how many are to the left, right, top, and bottom.
   - The conditions for counting are based on the coordinates where it checks the relative positions of the sofas.

3. **Output Decision**: The program compares the counts obtained from `func_1` against the required conditions. If a match is found, it prints the index (1-based) of the matching sofa, otherwise it prints -1.

### Potential Issues in Logic:
- The counting logic in the `func_1` function only checks the coordinates of the first cell of the sofa (i.e., `sofa[0]`), ignoring the second cell of the sofa.
- Sofas can be oriented either horizontally or vertically, and the program must check if the conditions meet for both cells. For instance, if the sofa is represented by cells (1, 1) and (1, 2), if another sofa is in positions to the left (e.g., (1, 0) and (1, 1)), the condition should still hold true regardless of which of the two cells (1,1) or (1,2) of the current sofa is being referred to.
- If the set of coordinates for the sofas allows for ambiguity, the program may not function properly in counting how many are correctly positioned based on both the cells of the current sofa.

### Example of Issue:
Consider the following input:
```
2
2 2
1 1 1 2
2 1 2 2
1 1 0 0
```
Here, we have 2 sofas:
- Sofa 1 occupies (1,1) and (1,2)
- Sofa 2 occupies (2,1) and (2,2)

Counting conditions suggest that there are 1 to the left (`sofa 1`), 0 to the right, and none above both. However, if we assess the actual condition using both cells of each sofa, the condition straightly may fail. 

This is indicative of how the counting mechanism could miss edge cases by incorrectly bounding on only one of the cells.

### Conclusion:
Given the possibility to present inputs where the program does not correctly validate or return outcomes per the problem's detailed requirements, we conclude that the provided program may not be fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
