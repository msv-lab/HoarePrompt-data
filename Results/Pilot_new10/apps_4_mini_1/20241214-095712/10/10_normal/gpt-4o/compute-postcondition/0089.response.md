The value of `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1, where `i` is currently 1. The states of the other variables, including `d`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `bottom_count[1]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `bottom_count[1]` is increased by 1**.
