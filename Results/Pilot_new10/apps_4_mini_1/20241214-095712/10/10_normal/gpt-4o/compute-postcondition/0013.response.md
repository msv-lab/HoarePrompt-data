The variables `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are assigned the values obtained from user input, which is processed as four integers after stripping whitespace and splitting the input string.

The other variables remain unchanged: `d` is still an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` still contains `d` tuples of the form `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, and `loop variable` remains `d - 1`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` also remain the last set of values assigned from input.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` contains `d` tuples of the form `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `loop variable` is `d - 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the last set of values assigned from input, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are from user input integers.**
