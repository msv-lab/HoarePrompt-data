Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `target_sofa` is either -1 (if no sofa met the conditions) or the index of the first sofa (1-based) that satisfies the conditions defined by `left_count[i] == cnt_l`, `right_count[i] == cnt_r`, `top_count[i] == cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i] == cnt_b`. If no sofa satisfies these conditions, the earlier value of `target_sofa` remains unchanged, which was initially -1.**
