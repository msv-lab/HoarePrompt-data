Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[2]`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is increased by 1. If `x1` is less than or equal to `x2_j` or `x2` is less than or equal to `x2_j`, the state remains unchanged.***
