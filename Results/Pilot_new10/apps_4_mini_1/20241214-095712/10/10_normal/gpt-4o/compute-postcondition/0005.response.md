The variable `sofas` is an empty list, and after executing the code `sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))`, a tuple containing the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` is added to the `sofas` list. The `d`, `n`, `m`, `loop variable`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` contains one tuple ((x1, y1, x2, y2)), `loop variable` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from input.**
