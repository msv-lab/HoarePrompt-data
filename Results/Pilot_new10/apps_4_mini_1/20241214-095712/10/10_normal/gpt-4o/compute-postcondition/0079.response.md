In the given code snippet, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables such as `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `bottom_count[i]` are unaffected by this operation. 

Since `i` is equal to 1 and `top_count[i]` is being incremented, we only need to express the change in `top_count`.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1.**
