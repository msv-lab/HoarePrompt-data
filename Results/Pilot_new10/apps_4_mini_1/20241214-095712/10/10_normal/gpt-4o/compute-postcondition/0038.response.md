The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, in this case, the loop that is being iterated over will be skipped, and no variables' states are modified.

Output State: **`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`, and `d` must be greater than 1; we continue with the next iteration of the loop without modifying any variable.**
