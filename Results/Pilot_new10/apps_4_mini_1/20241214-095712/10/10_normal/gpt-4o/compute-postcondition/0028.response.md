Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`. The current value of `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, the current value of `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, and if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, `right_count[0]` is increased by 1 while the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
