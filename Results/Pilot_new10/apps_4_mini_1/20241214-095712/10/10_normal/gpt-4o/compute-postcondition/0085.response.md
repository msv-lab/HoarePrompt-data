The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1. The state of `d`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, and `x2`, `y2` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged, and `right_count[1]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged, `right_count[1]` is increased by 1**.
