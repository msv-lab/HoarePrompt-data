According to the code, the loop is determined by the variable `d`, which denotes the number of iterations. The variable `loop variable` is currently 0, meaning it corresponds to the first iteration of the loop. Since `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, for the loop to execute one more time, `loop variable` must increase by 1.

After the last iteration, as `loop variable` was 0, it will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, to continue executing the loop, `d` must be greater than the current value of `loop variable`. Since `loop variable` is now 1, `d` must be greater than 1.

State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` contains one tuple ((x1, y1, x2, y2)), `loop variable` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from input, and `d` must be greater than 1**
