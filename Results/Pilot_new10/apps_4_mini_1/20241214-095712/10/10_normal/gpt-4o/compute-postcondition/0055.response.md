The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `left_count[i]` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[2]`, and `left_count[i]` is increased by 1.
