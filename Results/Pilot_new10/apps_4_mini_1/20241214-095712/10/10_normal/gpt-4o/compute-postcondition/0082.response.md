The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the loop, moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, and `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
