Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of `sofas[i]`. If `left_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, and `bottom_count[i]` are equal to `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` respectively, then `target_sofa` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
