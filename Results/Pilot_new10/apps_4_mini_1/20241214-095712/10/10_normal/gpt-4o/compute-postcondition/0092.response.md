Postcondition: ***Given that `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1, if `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `top_count[1]` is increased by 1 and `bottom_count[1]` may also be increased by 1 if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`. If the condition is not met, all other variables including `left_count[1]`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged.***
