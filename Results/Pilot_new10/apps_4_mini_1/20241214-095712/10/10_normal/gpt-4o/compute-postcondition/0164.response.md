Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of `sofas[2]`. If the counts match (`left_count[i] == cnt_l`, `right_count[i] == cnt_r`, `top_count[i] == cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i] == cnt_b`), `target_sofa` is set to 3 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
