The code assigns values to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` by taking input from the user, which is expected to be four space-separated integers. The precondition states that `d`, `n`, `m`, and `sofas` remain unchanged while `loop variable` remains at 0 after the first iteration, but `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will now hold values based on the user input.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` is an empty list, `loop variable` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from input.**
