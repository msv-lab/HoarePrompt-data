Postcondition: ***`right_count[1]`, `left_count[1]`, `bottom_count[2]`, and `top_count[1]` are updated counts based on comparisons with all sofas except `sofas[1]`. The current value of `y1` is greater than `y2_j`, and the current value of `y2` is also greater than `y2_j`. Therefore, `bottom_count[2]` is increased by 1. The condition `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`, with `j` being 0. Otherwise, the counts remain unchanged.***
