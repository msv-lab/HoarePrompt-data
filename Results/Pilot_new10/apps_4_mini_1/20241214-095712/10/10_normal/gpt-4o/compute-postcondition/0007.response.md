The line of code `x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())` takes input, splits it into parts, and assigns the integer values to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. Since `sofas` contains one tuple ((x1, y1, x2, y2)), the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will now reflect the integers provided in the input.

Given that `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is a positive integer, and `m` is a positive integer, the variables `d`, `n`, and `m` remain unaffected by this line of code. The tuples in `sofas` will now contain the new values assigned to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` contains one tuple ((x1, y1, x2, y2)), where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the integers provided as input.**
