Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If `i` is equal to `j`, then `i` is updated to 1, `j` is updated to 1, and `x1, y1, x2, y2` are updated to the values from `sofas[1]`. The values of `right_count[0]`, `left_count[0]`, `bottom_count[0]`, and `top_count[0]` reflect the number of sofas in relation to `sofas[0]`. If `i` is not equal to `j`, the values remain unchanged.***
