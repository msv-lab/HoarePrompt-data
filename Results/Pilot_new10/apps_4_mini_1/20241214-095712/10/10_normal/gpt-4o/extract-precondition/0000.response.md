Precondition: **d is an integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) representing the number of sofas, n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) representing the dimensions of the matrix, and each of the next d lines contains four integers (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) such that (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n) and (1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m), representing the coordinates of the sofas. The last line consists of four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) where (0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1).**
