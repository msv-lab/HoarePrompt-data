Postcondition: ***`sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, and `s` is the third tuple in the list `sofas`. If the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then `left` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged.***
