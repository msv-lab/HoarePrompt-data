The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The values of `sofa` and `sofas` remain unchanged, so they still hold their initial conditions. The output does not provide the previous value of `left`, but simply states that it has increased by 1. 

Output State: **`sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `left` is increased by 1.**
