Postcondition: ***`sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `s` is the first tuple in `sofas`, and the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`. If the first element of `sofa` is less than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, then `left` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged.***
