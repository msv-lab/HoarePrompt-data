Postcondition: ***`sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `s` is the first tuple in `sofas`, and the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`. The first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s`, and the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`. As a result, `left` has been increased by 1 and `right` has been increased by 1.***
