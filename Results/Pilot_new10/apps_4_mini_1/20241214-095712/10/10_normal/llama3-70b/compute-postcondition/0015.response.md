Postcondition: ***`sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, and `s` is the first tuple in `sofas`. If the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`, then if the first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, both `left`, `right`, and `bottom` are increased by 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to the values of `left`, `right`, and `bottom`. If `s` is equal to `sofa`, no conditions are applied, and the state remains unchanged.***
