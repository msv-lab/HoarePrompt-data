The value of `left` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `left` is unknown. The initial state of the other variables remains valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `s` is the third tuple in the list `sofas`, and `left` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `s` is the third tuple in the list `sofas`, and `left` is increased by 1**.
