The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sofa` and `sofas`. The parameter `sofa` is an integer that represents the index of a specific sofa, while `sofas` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers representing the coordinates of each sofa. After executing the function body, it returns four integers representing the counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the specified sofa based on their coordinates, excluding the specified sofa itself from these counts.
