According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sofas`. Since `sofas` has at least 1 tuple, the loop can execute a second time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is the first tuple in `sofas`. The loop will iterate to get the next tuple from `sofas`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be adjusted to be the second tuple in `sofas`.

State: **`sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, and `s` is the second tuple in the list `sofas`.**
