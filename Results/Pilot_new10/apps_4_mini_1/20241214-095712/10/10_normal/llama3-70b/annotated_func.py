#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is an integer representing the number of sofas, sofas is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers representing the coordinates of each sofa. The last input represents four integers indicating the counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom. All integers are within the given constraints.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with size equal to its original size, `left` represents the number of sofas to the left of `sofa` based on their coordinates, `right` represents the number of sofas to the right of `sofa`, `top` represents the number of sofas above `sofa`, and `bottom` represents the number of sofas below `sofa`. If `sofa` coincides with any tuple in `sofas`, it is not counted in left, right, top, or bottom calculations.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns the values of left, right, top, and bottom which represent the number of sofas to the left, right, above, and below the specified sofa respectively, based on their coordinates, excluding the sofa itself from these counts.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `sofa` representing the index of a sofa and a list of tuples `sofas` containing coordinates of each sofa. It returns four integers indicating the counts of sofas that are positioned to the left, right, top, and bottom of the specified sofa based on their coordinates. The function counts only those sofas that are not the same as the specified sofa. However, the input type for `sofa` should be clearer; it is expected to be used as an index but not enforced in the implementation, potentially leading to incorrect results if the provided index does not align with the tuple structure. Hence, validation for `sofa` being a valid index should be considered an edge case.
