Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of sofas based on the conditions specified. In particular, it confuses the coordinates of sofas. The function `func_1` only checks the first coordinate of the sofas, leading to incorrect counts in relation to the entire sofa structure.

### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Coordinate Comparison**: The program checks the coordinates at `sofa[0]` but does not adequately consider the two cells that a sofa occupies. This can lead to incorrect comparisons and thus incorrect counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom.

2. **Index Handling**: The description of the input suggests the need for clarity about how the index is used within the function. While currently it uses a tuple directly, the expected logic should be clearer about separating the two coordinates of each sofa.

3. **Lack of Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle cases where the sofas are aligned vertically or horizontally in other than the strictly expected manner, meaning there might be sofas at the same horizontal or vertical position that would not be counted accurately.

### Example of Incorrect Case:
For a simple configuration:
```
Input:
2
2 2
1 1 1 2  # Sofa 1
2 1 2 2  # Sofa 2
1 0 0 1  # Expected counts
```
The expected output should be `1` as sofa 1 has 1 sofa to its right and none other. However, due to incorrect counting logic in `func_1`, it will not return the expected value.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description, validating a conclusion of incorrectness.
