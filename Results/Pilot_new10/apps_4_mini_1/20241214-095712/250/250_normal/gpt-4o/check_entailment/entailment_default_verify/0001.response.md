Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not appropriately handle all edge cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, it fails in scenarios where neither `x` nor `y` can be measured and doesn't ensure that the necessary marks are added to achieve both distances. An example highlighting this is when the inputs are `2 100 10 20 0 100`. In this case, since neither `10` nor `20` can be measured from the existing marks, the program might suggest adding only one mark instead of both required marks. Thus, the conclusion that the program's correctness is deficient remains valid.
