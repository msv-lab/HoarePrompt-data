Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases required by the problem description, specifically it fails to ensure that the distances `x` and `y` can be measured accurately using the marks already present or after adding the minimum number of new marks.

One significant issue arises where the program checks for the ability to measure `x` or `y` using the existing marks, but does not correctly account for the scenario where both `x` and `y` need to be derived from adding new marks efficiently. The code seems to give precedence to checking for combinations using existing marks without fully ensuring that both necessary distances can be measured after potentially adding marks.

For example, consider the input:
```
2 300 185 230
0 300
```
The correct output should indicate that both `185` and `230` are required since the existing marks (0 and 300) cannot be used to derive these distances. The logic applied in the code fails to recognize that two new marks are necessary in this case. It may print fewer marks than required or incorrectly validate the existing distances.

Thus, since there are cases where the expected output does not match the requirements given in the problem description, the overall correctness of the implementation is false.
