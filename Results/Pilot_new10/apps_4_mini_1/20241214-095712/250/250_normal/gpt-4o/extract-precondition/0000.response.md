Precondition: **n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, l is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, x and y are positive integers where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; the sequence a is a list of n integers where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l, with each a[i] (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ l) representing the distances of the marks from the origin.**
