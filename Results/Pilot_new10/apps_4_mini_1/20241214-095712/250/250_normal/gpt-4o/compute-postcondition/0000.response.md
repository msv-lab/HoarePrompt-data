The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are assigned based on the input values that are mapped to integers from the input string. Other variables remain unchanged, and their values are not specified in the output state because they are not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are now integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` have been assigned new integer values from input.**
