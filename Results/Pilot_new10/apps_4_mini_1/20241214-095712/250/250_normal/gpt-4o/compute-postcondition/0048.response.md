Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, and `x_found` is False while `y_found` is False. Additionally, `y_found` remains False, and none of the following conditions hold: `mark + y + x` is not in `marks_set`, `mark + y - x` is not in `marks_set`, and `mark - y + x` is not in `marks_set`. The current value of `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, while the value of `new_marks` may have changed based on the conditions involving `marks_set`, `x`, and `y`, or it remains unchanged if no conditions were satisfied.***
