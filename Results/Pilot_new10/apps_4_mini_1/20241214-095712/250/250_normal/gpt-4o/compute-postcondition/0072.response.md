Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` has at least one more element, `mark` is the next element in the `marks` collection. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` exists in `marks_set`, then the element `mark - y` is included in `new_marks`.***
