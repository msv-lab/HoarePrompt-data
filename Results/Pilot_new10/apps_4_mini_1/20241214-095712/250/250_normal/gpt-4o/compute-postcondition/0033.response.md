The code assigns an empty set to the variable `new_marks`. This does not affect the other variables in the initial state, so their values remain unchanged. The `new_marks` variable is now an empty set, and we will carry forward the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, either `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False (or both), `new_marks` is an empty set.**
