According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. If there are more marks in the list, the loop will execute again for the next mark. At the end of the last iteration, we have the current state where `mark` is the last mark processed in the loop. If `marks` contains at least one more mark after the current `mark`, the loop can execute one more time.

Thus, we need to consider the number of marks. If `marks` has `n` elements and `mark` corresponds to the last one processed, then the index **of `mark`** must be 1 less than `n`, and the **next mark** will be marked as `mark` for processing in the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` has at least one more element, `mark` is the next mark in `marks`**
