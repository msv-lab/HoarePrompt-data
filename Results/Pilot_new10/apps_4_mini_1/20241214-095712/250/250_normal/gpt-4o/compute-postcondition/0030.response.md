Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`. The current value of `x_found` is True, indicating there exists a `mark` such that `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`. The current value of `y_found` is True, indicating there exists a `mark` such that `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set.***
