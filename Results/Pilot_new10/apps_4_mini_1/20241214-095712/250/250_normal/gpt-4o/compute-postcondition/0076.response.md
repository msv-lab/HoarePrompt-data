Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` contains all integers of the form `mark ± x` and `mark ± y` for each `mark` in `marks` where applicable, `x_found` is either True or False based on whether an appropriate match for `x` was found, `y_found` is either True or False based on whether an appropriate match for `y` was found. The `new_marks` list is not empty, indicating that there are valid marks derived from the original `marks` list adjusted by the values of `x` and/or `y`.***
