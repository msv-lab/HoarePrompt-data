The code creates a set from the list of integers `marks`, which eliminates any duplicate entries and stores unique values in `marks_set`. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The state of the `marks` variable also remains as a list, but `marks_set` is now a set containing the unique integers from `marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9; `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `marks` is a list of integers derived from input; `marks_set` is a set containing unique integers from `marks`.**
