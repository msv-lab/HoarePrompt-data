Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` has at least one more element, and if `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark + x`. Otherwise, if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - x`.***
