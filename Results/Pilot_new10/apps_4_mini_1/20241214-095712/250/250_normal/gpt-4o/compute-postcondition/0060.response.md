The code `new_marks.add(mark - y)` adds the value of `mark - y` to the set `new_marks`. The values of the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, and `marks_set` remain the same because the code does not change these variables.

Since `mark` is a variable that was not explicitly defined in the initial state given, we cannot determine its specific value. However, we know that `y` is a positive integer where `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`, meaning `y` must be at least 1 and less than or equal to `l`.

The value of `mark - y` will also depend on the specific value of `mark`, but it will definitely be an integer.

The Output State should record that `new_marks` now includes the value `mark - y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` has at least one more element, `new_marks` includes `mark - y`.**
