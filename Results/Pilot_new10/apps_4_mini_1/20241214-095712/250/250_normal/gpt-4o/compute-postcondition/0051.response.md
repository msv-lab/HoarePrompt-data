Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False. If either `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is updated to include `mark + y`. Otherwise, if either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is updated to include `mark - y`; if neither condition is satisfied, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
