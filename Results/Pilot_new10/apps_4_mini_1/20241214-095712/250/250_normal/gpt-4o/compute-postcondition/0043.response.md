Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, and `x_found` is False while `y_found` is False. If `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains the value `mark + x`. If none of these conditions are satisfied but either `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - x`. If neither condition is met, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
