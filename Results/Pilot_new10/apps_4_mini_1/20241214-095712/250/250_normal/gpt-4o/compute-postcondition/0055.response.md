The operation `new_marks.add(mark - x)` adds the value of `mark - x` to the `new_marks` set. Since `marks` has at least one more element and `mark` is the next mark in `marks`, we know that `mark` will be a valid value. Additionally, `x` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`. As `mark` is directly referenced, its specific value is not defined but it is greater than `x`, therefore `mark - x` will yield a positive value.

Updated Information:
- `new_marks` now contains the value `mark - x`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` has at least one more element, `mark` is the next mark in `marks`, and `new_marks` contains `mark - x`.**
