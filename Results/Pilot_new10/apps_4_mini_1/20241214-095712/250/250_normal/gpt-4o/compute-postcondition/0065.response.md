The code `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds a new element to the `new_marks` collection by adding `x` to `mark`. The variables `x` and `mark` have not changed, but a new value has been calculated. The `new_marks` collection now contains one additional element.

Given that `mark` is the next element in the `marks` collection and both `x` and `mark` are positive integers, the resulting value added will be `mark + x`, which is also a positive integer. The state of the other variables is unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` has at least one more element, `mark` is the next element in the `marks` collection, and a new element `mark + x` has been added to `new_marks`.**
