The value of `need_x` is set to `True`, but it was already `True` in the initial state, so there is no change in the value of `need_x`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, `j` is `n - 1`, the current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, `j` is `n - 1`, the current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`.**
