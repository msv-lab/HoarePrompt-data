The code appends a new element to the `additional_marks` list. The new element being appended is `i + j`. Given the conditions in the initial state, `n` remains a positive integer, and `j` is currently the first valid element in `additional_marks`, resulting in `i + j` being less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains original elements plus one more element which is `i + j`, `j` is now the first valid element in `additional_marks`.**
