The code modifies the list `additional_marks` by appending the sum of `i` and `j` to it. The value of `i` is provided as the next element in `marks`, and `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain the same since they are not modified by this operation. The state shows that `additional_marks` increases in size but retains the original values alongside the new appendage.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains at least 4 elements (original elements plus the sum of `i` and `j`), `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`.**
