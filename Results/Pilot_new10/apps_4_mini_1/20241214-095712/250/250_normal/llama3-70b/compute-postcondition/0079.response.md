Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains elements such that each element is equal to `i + j` for each `j` in `additional_marks` that meets the condition of being less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`. If the loop does not execute, `additional_marks` remains unchanged from its initial state containing at least `y`, and `marks` must be a non-empty iterable.**
