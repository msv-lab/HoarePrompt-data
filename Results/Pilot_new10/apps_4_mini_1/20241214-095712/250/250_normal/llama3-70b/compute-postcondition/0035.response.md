According to the code, the loop is controlled by the range defined by `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `i`, which is 1, and goes up to `n`, which is a positive integer greater than 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Since `n` is greater than 2, if `j` is now 3, the loop can execute if there is still a valid index for `j`, assuming `n` is at least 4.

As such, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` must be 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 in case we are continuing the loop beyond the current value of `j`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, `j` is 3**
