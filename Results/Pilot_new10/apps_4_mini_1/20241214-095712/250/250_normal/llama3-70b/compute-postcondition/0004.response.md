According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n` and the initial value of `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 0 and `n` is a positive integer (at least 2), the loop can execute.

At the start of the loop:
- The variable `j` will take the value of `i`, which is initially 0.
- Since the conditions state that `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `i` is 0, the loop can successfully execute for `j` starting from 0 up to `n - 1`.

The current state does not require any modifications to ensure loop execution; however, it is important to state that `j` will initially be 0, and `i` is correctly initialized.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 0 (initial iteration index)**
