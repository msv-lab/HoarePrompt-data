Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `additional_marks` has at least 2 elements, and `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`, then `additional_marks` now includes the value `i + j`. Otherwise, the state of `additional_marks` remains unchanged.***
