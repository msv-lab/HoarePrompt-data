The value of `need_y` is explicitly set to `True`, but it was already `True`. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The Output State includes the initial conditions since `need_y` is reaffirmed as `True`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, and the difference `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`.**
