The operation `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the sum of `i` and `j` to the list `additional_marks`. Since `i` is the next element in `marks` and `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`, we are specifically appending the sum of these two variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `i` is the next element in `marks` (value is not specified)
- `additional_marks` contains at least 2 elements (implying `additional_marks` is a list with elements)
- `j` is the second element in `additional_marks` (value is also not specified but is an existing element in the list)

Now, the impact of executing `additional_marks.append(i + j)` is that a new element will be added to `additional_marks`, which is equal to `i + j`.

The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` do not change, but the length of the `additional_marks` list increases by one.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` now has one additional element which is `i + j`, and `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`.**
