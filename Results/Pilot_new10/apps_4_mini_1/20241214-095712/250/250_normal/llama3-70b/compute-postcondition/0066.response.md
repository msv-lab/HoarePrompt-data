The `additional_marks` list is updated to include the value of `y`. The current value of `need_y` is False, which does not impact the addition of `y` to `additional_marks`. The impact of the code is solely on `additional_marks`, where the new value is the previous contents of `additional_marks` with `y` appended to it. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `n` is still a positive integer, `need_x` is False, `need_y` remains False, and `i` and `j` retain the value of `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` now contains the value of `y` appended to it, `i` and `j` remain as `n - 1`.**
