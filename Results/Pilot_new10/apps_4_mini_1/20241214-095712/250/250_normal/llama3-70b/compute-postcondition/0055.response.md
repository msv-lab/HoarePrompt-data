The value of `need_x` is assigned `True`, but it is already `True` in the initial state, so there is no change in the variable's state. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `need_y` remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True.**
