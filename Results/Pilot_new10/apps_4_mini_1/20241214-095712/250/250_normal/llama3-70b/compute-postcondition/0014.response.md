The variable `need_y` is assigned the value `True`, so the state of this variable changes. The other variables remain unaffected as no operations were performed on them in the provided code. The condition regarding `marks[j]`, `marks[i]`, and `need_x` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `need_y` is True, and if the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is set to True.**
