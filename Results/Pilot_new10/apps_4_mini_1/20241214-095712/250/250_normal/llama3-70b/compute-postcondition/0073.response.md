According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `additional_marks` list. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` contains at least one element (specifically `j` which is the first element) and `i` is the first element in `marks`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `additional_marks` list must have at least one more element. The variable `j` corresponds to the next element in the `additional_marks` list compared to the previous iteration. If `additional_marks` initially contains at least one element, then after one iteration with the first element, for the loop to execute again, `additional_marks` must contain at least two elements and `j` must be the second element in the list.

Thus, the first element `i` remains unchanged but `j` needs to be updated to the next element in `additional_marks`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `additional_marks` must contain at least 2 elements, and `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`.**
