According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `additional_marks` list. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` contains at least 2 elements, and `j` is currently the second element in that list. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next element in `additional_marks`, which means `additional_marks` should have at least 3 elements. 

Therefore, we need to set `j` to refer to the third element of `additional_marks`. In addition, since `j` is currently the second element in the list, for the loop to execute again, it implies `additional_marks` needs to have at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains at least 3 elements with `j` as the third element.**
