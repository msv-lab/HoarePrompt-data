The code assigns the variable `marks` a set of integers, which are derived from user input processed by splitting a string input into individual components, converting each to an integer, and then wrapping them in a set (to ensure uniqueness). The variable `marks` will now hold a collection of distinct integers, but since `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are not altered by this operation, they remain unchanged.

Given that `marks` is now a set of integers, we cannot specify the exact values it holds without concrete input. However, it will be a unique collection of integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a set of unique integers from user input.**
