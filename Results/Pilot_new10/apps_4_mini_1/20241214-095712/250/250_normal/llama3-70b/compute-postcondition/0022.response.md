According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer, which means `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1 to allow for the next iteration at `i = 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, `j` must be n-1**
