The variable `need_y` is explicitly assigned the value `True`, but it was already `True` before this assignment. Therefore, the state of the other variables is not affected or changed by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, `j` is 3**
