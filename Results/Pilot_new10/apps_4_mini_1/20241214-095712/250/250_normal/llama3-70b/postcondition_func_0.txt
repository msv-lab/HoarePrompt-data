The function accepts a list of marks and identifies if additional marks are needed to satisfy certain differences. It adds missing differences to an additional marks list, computes possible new marks by summing existing marks with the additional marks, and outputs the count and values of any new marks that can be formed without exceeding the bounds set by `l` or duplicating existing marks.
