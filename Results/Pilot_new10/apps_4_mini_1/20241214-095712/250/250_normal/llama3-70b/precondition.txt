n is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of marks on the ruler, l is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9) representing the ruler's length, x and y are positive integers (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) representing the jump distances required for girls and boys, respectively. a is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l) representing the distances of the marks from the origin.
