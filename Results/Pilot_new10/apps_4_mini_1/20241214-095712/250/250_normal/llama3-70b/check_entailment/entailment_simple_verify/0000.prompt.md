You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))


```
Original Assessment: To verify the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program's functionality step-by-step and identify any potential edge cases or flaws.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. The program begins by reading the input values for `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, which correspond to the number of marks, the length of the ruler, and the required jump distances for girls and boys, respectively.

2. It then reads the list of existing marks, storing them in a set for quick access.

3. The program initializes two boolean flags (`need_x` and `need_y`) to track if the required distances `x` and `y` can be measured with the current marks.

4. The nested loop structure checks all pairs of marks `(i, j)` to see if the difference between marks `j` and `i` equals `x` or `y`. If a required distance is found, the corresponding flag is set to `True`.

5. If either `need_x` or `need_y` remains `False`, it adds the corresponding distance to a list of `additional_marks`.

6. The program then tries to generate new marks by adding existing marks to any added marks not exceeding the length `l` and adds those to the list of `additional_marks`.

7. Finally, it outputs the number of additional marks needed and their values.

### Potential Cases to Consider:

1. **Missing Marks Case**: If neither distance `x` nor `y` can be measured, the program will add them to `additional_marks`, but it does not check whether these values are already part of the existing marks. If the marks already include `x` or `y`, it incorrectly adds them again.

   - **Example**: 
     - Input: `2 300 250 300` 
     - Existing marks: `0, 300` 
     - Expected output: `1` (add `250`)
     - Actual output: could output `1` and add `250`, which is correct.

2. **Exceeding Length Case**: When attempting to add new marks by summing an existing mark with a newly added one, there is a potential logic flaw in the conditional check. If `i + j` exceeds `l`, the new mark shouldn't be added; however, `i` might already contain `l`, leading to an incorrect sum that does not trigger an essential check.

   - **Example**:
     - Input: `3 250 185 230`
     - Existing marks: `0, 185, 250`
     - The program could incorrectly add values that exceed `l` when calculating `i + j`.

3. **Non-unique Added Marks**: The program does not ensure that the newly added marks are not already present in the existing marks set. 

   - **Example**:
     - Input: `3 250 185 230` 
     - Existing marks: `0, 185, 250`
     - Would try to add `230`, which should be avoided because it already exists.

### Conclusion:
Given these potential pitfalls and the failure of the program to handle all edge cases correctly, particularly in checking for the inclusion of marks, mismanagement of sums exceeding `l`, and the lack of guarantees about the uniqueness of added marks, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), l is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), x and y are positive integers (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and a is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l) representing the positions of the marks on the ruler.
def func():
    n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    need_x, need_y = False, False
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `need_x` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `y`, `i` must be `n - 1` and `j` is also `n - 1` if the loop executed at least `n` times. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `need_x` and `need_y` retain their initial values, which are both False.
    additional_marks = []
    if (not need_x) :
        additional_marks.append(x)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer. If `need_x` is False, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `y`, and `additional_marks` will contain `x`. The values of `i` and `j` remain as `n - 1` if the loop executed at least `n` times.
    if (not need_y) :
        additional_marks.append(y)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer. If `need_x` is False and `need_y` is also False, then `additional_marks` now contains the value of `y` appended to it, and the values of `i` and `j` remain as `n - 1`. If `need_y` is True, the program does not execute the if block, and the state is as described in the precondition.
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is the last element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains elements that are the sums of every element in `marks` added to every element in the original `additional_marks` where each sum is less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`. If the loop does not execute, `additional_marks` remains unchanged from its initial state containing at least `y`, and `marks` is a non-empty iterable.
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))
