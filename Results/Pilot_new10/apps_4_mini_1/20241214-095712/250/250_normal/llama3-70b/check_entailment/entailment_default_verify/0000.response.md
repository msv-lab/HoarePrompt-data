The original assessment correctly identifies the flaws in the program based on the given problem description. The program does not effectively handle all edge cases, particularly in regards to adding new marks without verifying their uniqueness or ensuring they do not exceed the ruler's length. The issues identified include:

1. The program could potentially add already existing marks again.
2. It might attempt to add marks resulting from sums of existing marks that exceed the allowed length `l`.
3. The logic for checking whether the required distances can be measured fails to fully account for the existing marks.

Given these flaws outlined in the assessment, I can confirm that the assessment was accurate.

Final: **False**.
