The value of `n` is assigned the result of `n //= 10`, which means `n` is divided by 10 using integer division. Since the initial value of `n` is 9, the result of `9 // 10` is 0. The value of `max_9s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is 0; `max_9s` is now 3**
