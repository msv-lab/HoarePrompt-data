The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, the output constraints are not provided. Therefore, without any additional output information, it is impossible to specify the return value. Assuming that there is no further information on the output, we cannot conclude the functionality accurately. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, where n is an integer within the bounds of 2 and 10^9. The output is not specified.**
