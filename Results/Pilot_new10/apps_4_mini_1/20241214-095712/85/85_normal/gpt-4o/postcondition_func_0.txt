The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and counts how many times `n` ends with the digit 9, by checking whether (n + 1) is divisible by 10. The function then calculates the product of (n + 1) and the count of trailing 9s and prints the result. If `n` initially ends in 0, the function will not count any trailing 9s and will produce an output based on the value of `(n + 1) * max_9s`, which will be `n + 1`. The output will vary depending on how many times `n` had the digit 9 at the end.
