You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.

Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.

You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 

Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

It is guaranteed that for every n ≤ 10^9 the answer doesn't exceed 2·10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
3

Input
14

Output
9

Input
50

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose:  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5. 

In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp:  1 and 8;  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5;  5 and 14;  6 and 13;  7 and 12;  8 and 11;  9 and 10. 

In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        n //= 10
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to consider how the program calculates the number of pairs of shovels that lead to the maximum number of nines at the end of their total cost.

The program works in the following way:
1. It calculates the maximum number of trailing nines (max_9s) by continuously checking if `(n + 1)` is divisible by 10. It counts how many times this is true and reduces `n` by a factor of 10 each time.
2. It calculates the pairs using the formula `(n + 1) * max_9s` and prints this value.

### Case Analysis
1. The function counts trailing nines based on whether `(n + 1)` is divisible by 10. This is incorrect because the correct pairs leading to trailing nines need to be based on the sum of indices of shovels where the sum ends in 9. For instance, if you have shovels costing 1 to n, valid pairs need to be checked against specific conditions leading to '9' at the end of their sum (e.g., costs 2 and 7 sum to 9).
2. The potential values of `n` being any number from 2 to 10^9 means corner cases must be considered, such as when `n = 2`, where the only possible pair (1 and 2) yields a sum of 3, which has no nines.

### Example Input:
For `n = 2`:
- The program would compute max_9s as `0` (since `(n + 1) % 10 != 0`).
- The number of pairs would be `(2 + 1) * 0` which is `0`, but there is actually one valid pair (1, 2) and this case isn't captured.

This indicates the program does not compute correctly for the lower edge cases.

### Conclusion
Since the program fails to correctly handle at least one case – specifically failing to count pairs for the smallest n value – the correctness of the program is in question.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly identify the count of shovel pairs for all possible inputs as shown with the example where `n = 2`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and counts how many times `n` ends with the digit 9, by checking whether (n + 1) is divisible by 10. The function then calculates the product of (n + 1) and the count of trailing 9s and prints the result. If `n` initially ends in 0, the function will not count any trailing 9s and will produce an output based on the value of `(n + 1) * max_9s`, which will be `n + 1`. The output will vary depending on how many times `n` had the digit 9 at the end. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
