Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of trailing nines. 

The code's logic erroneously counts the number of times `n` (increased by 1) is divisible by 10, which does not relate properly to the idea of counting pairs of shovel costs that sum to a value ending in nines. The calculation of `pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s` is flawed, as it does not take into account how pairs of shovel costs are structured or how they can sum to specific values.

For example, when `n` is 7, the expected output is `3` because the pairs (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5) yield sums ending in one nine. However, the code will not give this correct output due to its faulty logic and manipulation of `n`.

Additionally, the description mentions that if the maximum number of 9s is 0, then we should count all such ways; the code does not correctly implement this, leading to an incorrect output in various potential cases.

Hence, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all possible cases.
