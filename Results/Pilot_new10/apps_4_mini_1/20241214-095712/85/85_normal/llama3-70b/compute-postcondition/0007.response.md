The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Given that `ans` was initially 1, after executing the code `ans += 1`, the new value of `ans` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: if `n` is at least 4, `ans` is 2, `i` is 2.

Output State: **if `n` is at least 4, `ans` is 2, `i` is 2**
