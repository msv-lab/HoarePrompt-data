Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases, as described in the problem statement. Here's the rationale for the correctness:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input correctly to extract the number of digits, the base of each number, and the digits themselves for both numbers X and Y.
  
2. **Base Conversion**: The function `func_1` is designed to convert the list of digits from the given base into a decimal representation. This is done using the standard approach of multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the next digit, which is accurate for converting from any base to decimal.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After obtaining the decimal values for both X and Y, the program compares them and outputs the correct relationship ('<', '>', or '=') based on their values.

4. **Constraints Handling**: The program adheres to the constraints given in the problem statement, particularly that the bases `b_x` and `b_y` are different, and the digit values are legitimate within their respective bases.

Since all potential cases align with the specified requirements, and I cannot find any edge cases where the program would fail, I conclude that it is correct.

Therefore, the output is:
Correctness: **True**
