Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `digits` representing the digits of a number, and an integer `base` between 2 and 40. It returns the decimal representation of the number formed by `digits` in the specified `base`. The function does not handle cases where `digits` contains invalid values (i.e., values not less than the `base`), which could lead to incorrect calculations or assumptions about what constitutes valid input. If `digits` is empty, a return value of 0 is given, as per the annotations. **
