According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 element, and `digit` is the first element of the list. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 2 elements, and `digit` should then be updated to the second element of the list.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit`, `digit` is the second element of digits**
