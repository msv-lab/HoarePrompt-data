The program is designed to read two numbers X and Y, represented in different bases (b_x and b_y), and then compare them. To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the elements one by one.

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads two integers, n (number of digits for X) and base_x (the base of representation for X) from the first line.
   - It then reads the n digits of X in the second line and performs the same for Y (m and base_y, followed by m digits).

2. **Base Conversion**:
   - The function `func_1` is implemented correctly to convert a number from its base representation to decimal. It iteratively multiplies the current decimal value by the base and adds the next digit. This follows the correct process to convert from a positional numeral system to decimal.
   - The conversion works within the constraints provided (digits are in the correct range and there are no leading zeros).

3. **Comparison of Values**:
   - After conversion, the program compares the decimal values of X and Y using standard comparison operators, which gives the correct output as per the required format ('<', '>', or '=').

4. **Output**:
   - The outputs are generated according to the comparisons made, and they are directly aligned with the expected results stated in the problem.

Given all these points, the program successfully implements all the requirements mentioned in the problem description. It handles base conversions correctly, processes inputs as specified, and produces the expected comparisons and outputs.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
