You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base b_{x} and a number Y represented in base b_{y}. Compare those two numbers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and b_{x} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{x} ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the b_{x}-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} < b_{x}) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and b_{y} (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{y} ≤ 40, b_{x} ≠ b_{y}), where m is the number of digits in the b_{y}-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m} (0 ≤ y_{i} < b_{y}) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.


-----Output-----

Output a single character (quotes for clarity):   '<' if X < Y  '>' if X > Y  '=' if X = Y 


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
1 0 1 1 1 1
2 10
4 7

Output
=

Input
3 3
1 0 2

Output

Input
7 16
15 15 4 0 0 7 10
7 9
4 8 0 3 1 5 0

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first sample, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, $X = FF 4007 A_{16}$ and Y = 4803150_9. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and b_{x} is much larger than b_{y}, so X is clearly larger than Y.
Program:
```
(n, bx) = map(int, input().split())
x_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, by) = map(int, input().split())
y_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
x = func_1(x_digits, bx)
y = func_1(y_digits, by)
if x < y:
    print('<')
elif x > y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code against the requirements:

1. **Input Specification**:
   - The program reads the input to get `n` and `b_x`, followed by the digits of the number `X` in base `b_x`.
   - It does the same for number `Y`, reading `m` and `b_y` followed by its digits.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to convert the digits from their respective bases to decimal.
   - It then compares the two decimal values of `X` and `Y` and prints the corresponding relational symbol ('<', '>', '=').

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the conversion of bases correctly, as it accumulates the `result` by multiplying the previous value by the base and adding the next digit.
   - There are no assumptions about leading zeroes, as it states that there won't be leading zeroes in the input.

Now, let's consider potential cases:

- When `n` or `m` is equal to 1 (minimum size), the code should still correctly convert single digits in any base (between 2 and 40).
- When `b_x` and `b_y` are at their boundaries (e.g. 2 and 40), the conversion should hold as valid.
- The problem guarantees that `b_x` is not equal to `b_y`, simplifying some edge cases regarding base compatibility.

**Analyzing a Potential Edge Case**:
1. Input:
   ```
   1 2
   1
   1 3
   0
   ```
   
   Here, `X` in binary `1_2` is `1` in decimal, and `Y` in ternary `0_3` is `0` in decimal. Hence `X > Y`, and the output should be `>`.

2. Input:
   ```
   1 3
   0
   1 4
   1
   ```
   
   Here `X` in ternary `0_3` is `0` in decimal, and `Y` in quaternary `1_4` is `1` in decimal. Hence `X < Y`, and the output should be `<`.

After analyzing various cases and considering the inputs, the program does seem to handle valid inputs as specified in the description, including edge cases.

Therefore, there are no inputs where the program fails to meet the description's requirements, thus:

Correctness: **True**. 

This program correctly implements the required functionality, converting numbers between different bases and comparing them accurately.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, bx) = map(int, input().split())
x_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, by) = map(int, input().split())
y_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
x = func_1(x_digits, bx)
y = func_1(y_digits, by)
if x < y:
    print('<')
elif x > y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specified base, and base is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40. Additionally, the number of digits is between 1 and 10, and each digit is non-negative and less than the base.
def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is equal to the value represented by `digits` in the specified `base`, `digits` is a list of integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40. If `digits` is empty, then `result` is 0.
    return result
    #The program returns the value of 'result' which is equal to the value represented by 'digits' in the specified 'base'; if 'digits' is empty, then 'result' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits` representing the digits of a number in a specified base and an integer `base` (where 2 <= base <= 40). It calculates and returns the numeric value of the number represented by `digits` in the specified base. If `digits` is empty, the function returns 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
