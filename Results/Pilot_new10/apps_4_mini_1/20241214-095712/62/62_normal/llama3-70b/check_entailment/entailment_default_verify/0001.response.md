Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The program reads the input as specified in the problem description, converts the numbers X and Y from their respective bases to decimal using the provided `func_1`, and correctly compares the converted values. The output hints support this, stating that `func_1` handles the input as expected and achieves the correct conversion from arbitrary bases to decimal.

Moreover, the range of bases (2 to 40) and digits (with constraints given) indicates that the function will always receive valid input, thus reinforcing the program's robustness under the specified conditions. The program correctly outputs the comparison result between X and Y, fulfilling the requirements laid out in the problem description. Therefore, the assessment of correctness remains true.
