Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that converts a list of digits into its integer value by processing the digits according to their base. 

The logic of the program is structured as follows:

1. It reads the input values, including the number of digits and the bases for both numbers \(X\) and \(Y\).
2. It captures the digits of both numbers and passes them, along with their respective bases, to the function `func_1`.
3. The function `func_1` computes the integer value of the number represented by the digits in its specified base using a polynomial expansion approach.
4. After obtaining the integer values for both \(X\) and \(Y\), it compares them and prints the appropriate comparison result ('<', '>', or '=').

All scenarios described in the problem statement are handled correctly:
- The input constraints guarantee that all digits are proper for their bases, and since we have \(b_x \neq b_y\), the bases do not conflict.
- The implementation either successfully converts the numbers into decimal values regardless of their bases and accurately compares them based on the output condition.

Thus, there are no found edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to comply with the problem description. Therefore, the solution is deemed correct for all specified cases.
