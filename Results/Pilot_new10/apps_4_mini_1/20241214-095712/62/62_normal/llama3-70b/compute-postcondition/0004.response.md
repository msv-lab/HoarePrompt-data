The value of `result` is updated by multiplying it by `base` and then adding `digit`. Given that `result` is initially equal to the second integer in `digits`, and `digit` is also the second integer in the list, it follows that the new value of `result` becomes a calculation based on these values. 

Since both `result` and `digit` depend on the same integer from the `digits` list, let's denote the second integer in `digits` as `d`. We can express the update to `result` as follows:

- The new value of `result` will be `result * base + digit` which translates to `d * base + d` = `d * (base + 1)`.

The status of the other variables remains unchanged, so the output state is:

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `base` is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40; `result` is equal to `d * (base + 1)`; `digit` is equal to `d`**.
