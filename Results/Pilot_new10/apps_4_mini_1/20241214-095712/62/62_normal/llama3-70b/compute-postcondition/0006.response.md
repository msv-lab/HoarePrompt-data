To update the output state based on the provided code snippet and initial conditions, we need to analyze the formula used in the code:

1. The variable `result` is initially calculated as `d * (base + 1)`. This value will now be modified.
2. The `digit` variable is equal to the third integer in the `digits` list, and the `index` is `2`, implying that `digit` is the value at `digits[2]`.

Now, the line of code being executed is:
```python
result = result * base + digit
```

- This affects the variable `result` directly, multiplying its previous value by `base` and then adding `digit`.
- The previous value of `result` is `d * (base + 1)`. 

Therefore, we can calculate the new value of `result` as follows:
- `new_result = (d * (base + 1)) * base + digit`.

The other variables such as `digits`, `base`, `digit`, and `index` remain unchanged.

As a result, the output state captures the updated value of `result` while retaining the information about the initial conditions and unchanged variables. 

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements; `base` is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40; `result` is equal to `(d * (base + 1)) * base + digit`; `digit` is equal to the third integer in the list; `index` is 2**.
