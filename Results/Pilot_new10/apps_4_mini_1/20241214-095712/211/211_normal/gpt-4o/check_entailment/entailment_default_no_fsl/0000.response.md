Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle cases where the input array can be split into more than two non-zero sum subarrays when the total sum is zero. For example, in the input case where the array consists of the elements `[1, 2, 3, -5]`, the program's logic will only generate splits that may not represent the desired non-zero sums correctly.

To elaborate, the program checks if the total sum of the elements is zero. If it is not, the program correctly outputs that it can form one subarray with the entire array (which is valid). However, if the total sum is zero, the program looks for a single non-zero element and outputs a split based on that, potentially missing out on valid multi-part splits which satisfy the problem constraints.

For example, the input `1 2 3 -5` should be splittable into parts with non-zero sums like:
- `1 2`
- `3 -5`

However, the provided code would incorrectly report that the only split possible is into two parts: the first part could be `1 2` and the second part `3 -5`, but it does not account for the existence of the straightforward parts of each individual number.

This indicates the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, hence "Correctness: **False**".
