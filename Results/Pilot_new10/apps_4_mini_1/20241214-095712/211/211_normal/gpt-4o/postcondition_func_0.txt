The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100`) and a list `A` of `n` integers (each between -1000 and 1000). It calculates the sum of the elements in `A`. If the sum is not zero, it prints 'YES', followed by '1' and the values '1' and `n`. If the sum is zero, it checks each element in `A`; if it finds a non-zero element at index `i`, it prints 'YES', followed by '2', then prints '1' and `i + 1`, and finally prints `i + 2` and `n`. If all elements in `A` are zero, it prints 'NO'.
