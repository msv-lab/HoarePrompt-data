The code executes a print statement that outputs the value `2`. This action does not change any variable or the state of existing variables. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and no new variables are introduced.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed, and 2 has been printed.**
