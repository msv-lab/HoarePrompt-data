According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 1, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2 on the next iteration. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect these changes.

State: **`n` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2**
