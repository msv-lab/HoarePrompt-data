The impact of the code is that it executes a `break` statement, which ends the most immediate loop or conditional statement it is contained within. However, since `total_sum`, `i`, and `n` retain their values, and no new operations on those variables have taken place, the state of those variables remains unchanged. 

As a result, the Output State reflects that 'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, '1' and 3 have been printed, 4 and `n` have been printed, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `total_sum` is 0; `i` is 2; 'YES' has been printed; 2 has been printed; '1' and 3 have been printed; 4 and `n` have been printed; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
