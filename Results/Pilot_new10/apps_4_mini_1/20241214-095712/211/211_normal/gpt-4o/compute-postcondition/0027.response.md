The code prints the result of the expression `i + 2` and the current value of `n`. The variable `i` is 2, so `i + 2` equals 4. The variable `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, `n` will be printed as is.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `total_sum` is 0; `i` is 2; 'YES' has been printed; 2 has been printed; '1' and 3 have been printed; 4 and `n` have been printed.**
