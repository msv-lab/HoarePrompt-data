The code prints the result of the expression `i + 2` and the value of `n`. The variable `i` is initialized as `1`, so `i + 2` equals `3`. The `n` variable is an input positive integer, which remains unchanged in this context. The output will be `3` followed by the input value of `n`. The other variables `total_sum` and `i` are not affected by this output statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `total_sum` is 0; `i` is 1; printed output is '3 n'.**
