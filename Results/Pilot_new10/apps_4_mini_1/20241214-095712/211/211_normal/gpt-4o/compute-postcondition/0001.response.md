The variable `A` is assigned a list of integers created by taking input from the user, splitting the input string into components, converting each component into an integer, and capturing these in a list. The value of `n` indicates how many integers the user has input, and it determines the size of the list `A`. The values in `A` will correspond to the `n` integers provided by the user.

The state of `n` remains unchanged (it is still an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100), while `A` is now a list of `n` integers based on user input, where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, derived from user input.**
