Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; if `total_sum` is not equal to 0, 'YES' and '1' are printed, followed by the values of `1` and `n`. If `total_sum` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed, indicating that all elements in `A` are zero.***
