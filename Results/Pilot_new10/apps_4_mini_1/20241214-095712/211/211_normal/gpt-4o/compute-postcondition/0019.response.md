`The code will print the value '1' followed by the result of `i + 1`. Since `i` is initially 1, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `total_sum` is 0; `i` is 1. Additionally, the code produces an output of '1 2'.`

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `total_sum` is 0; `i` is 1; output is '1 2'**
