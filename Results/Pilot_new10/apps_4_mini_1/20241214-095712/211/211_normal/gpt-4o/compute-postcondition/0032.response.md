The function `func` does not explicitly declare its parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `A` is a list consisting of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. Since the output behavior is not provided, we will organize the information based on the constraints given.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `A` of `n` integers, where each integer is between -1000 and 1000.**
