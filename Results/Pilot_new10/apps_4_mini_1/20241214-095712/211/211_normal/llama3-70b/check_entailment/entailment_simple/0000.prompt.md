You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100, and A is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range of -1000 to 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` from `0` to `n`, `a` is equal to `A`, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers from input.
    if (prefix_sum[n] == 0) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` from `0` to `n`, `a` is equal to `A`, with `A` being a list of length `n` containing integers, and the value of `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0. If there are values of `r` from 1 to `n` such that `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is equal to the count of such valid `r` values plus 1, `l` is equal to the last valid `r` where the condition held true, and `r` takes its final value after the last iteration of the loop where `r` is equal to `n`. If there are no such `r` values, then `k` remains 1, `l` remains 1, and `r` equals `n`.
        print(k, l, n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is between 1 and 100. If `prefix_sum[n]` is equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `k` is equal to the count of valid `r` values plus 1, or 1 if no valid `r` values exist. `l` takes the last valid `r` value, or remains 1 if no such `r` values exist, and `r` is finally set to `n`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
