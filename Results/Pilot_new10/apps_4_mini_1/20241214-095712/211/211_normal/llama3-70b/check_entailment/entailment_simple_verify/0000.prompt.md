You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, we will analyze its logic and check for potential edge cases where it might fail.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program reads an integer `n` (the number of elements in the array) followed by `n` integers which form the array `A`.
2. It computes the prefix sums for the array and checks if the total sum of the array (`prefix_sum[n]`) is zero.
3. If the total sum is zero, the program outputs "NO," as it cannot split the array.
4. If the total sum is not zero, it attempts to split the array based on prefix sums not being zero at various points.
5. It initializes `k`, representing the count of new arrays, and `l`, which marks the start of the current subarray.
6. It then loops through the prefix sums to see where the splits can occur, and prints the beginning and end indices for each non-zero sum segment.

### Potential Edge Case:
One concerning edge case that appears in the logic is when:
- The input consists of an array containing both positive and negative integers that sum to zero but can be split into non-zero sums.
- For example, the input `4` followed by values `1, -1, 1, -1`. The total sum is `0`, so it would lead to a "NO," even though it is possible to split it into two segments of `[1]` and `[-1, 1, -1]`, which are not zero-sum segments.

Thus, the program does not account for cases where the combined array sums to zero but still allows for valid non-zero subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly identify split opportunities when the total sum of the array is zero, despite potential valid splits. Therefore, it does not follow the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100, and A is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range of -1000 to 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` from `0` to `n`, `a` is equal to `A`, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers from input.
    if (prefix_sum[n] == 0) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` from `0` to `n`, `a` is equal to `A`, with `A` being a list of length `n` containing integers, and the value of `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0. If there are values of `r` from 1 to `n` such that `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is equal to the count of such valid `r` values plus 1, `l` is equal to the last valid `r` where the condition held true, and `r` takes its final value after the last iteration of the loop where `r` is equal to `n`. If there are no such `r` values, then `k` remains 1, `l` remains 1, and `r` equals `n`.
        print(k, l, n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is between 1 and 100. If `prefix_sum[n]` is equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `k` is equal to the count of valid `r` values plus 1, or 1 if no valid `r` values exist. `l` takes the last valid `r` value, or remains 1 if no such `r` values exist, and `r` is finally set to `n`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
