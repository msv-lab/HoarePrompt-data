You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, we will analyze its logic and check for potential edge cases where it might fail.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program reads an integer `n` (the number of elements in the array) followed by `n` integers which form the array `A`.
2. It computes the prefix sums for the array and checks if the total sum of the array (`prefix_sum[n]`) is zero.
3. If the total sum is zero, the program outputs "NO," as it cannot split the array.
4. If the total sum is not zero, it attempts to split the array based on prefix sums not being zero at various points.
5. It initializes `k`, representing the count of new arrays, and `l`, which marks the start of the current subarray.
6. It then loops through the prefix sums to see where the splits can occur, and prints the beginning and end indices for each non-zero sum segment.

### Potential Edge Case:
One concerning edge case that appears in the logic is when:
- The input consists of an array containing both positive and negative integers that sum to zero but can be split into non-zero sums.
- For example, the input `4` followed by values `1, -1, 1, -1`. The total sum is `0`, so it would lead to a "NO," even though it is possible to split it into two segments of `[1]` and `[-1, 1, -1]`, which are not zero-sum segments.

Thus, the program does not account for cases where the combined array sums to zero but still allows for valid non-zero subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly identify split opportunities when the total sum of the array is zero, despite potential valid splits. Therefore, it does not follow the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function reads an integer `n` (between 1 and 100) followed by a list of `n` integers (each between -1000 and 1000). It computes a prefix sum of the list and checks if the total sum of the list (the last element of the prefix sum) is zero. If the total sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and counts the indices `r` where the prefix sum at `r` is not zero and not equal to the total sum, printing these indices along with a final index `n`. It does not return any values but outputs results directly to the console. Additionally, if all prefix sums are zero, only 'NO' is printed, without any further output. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
