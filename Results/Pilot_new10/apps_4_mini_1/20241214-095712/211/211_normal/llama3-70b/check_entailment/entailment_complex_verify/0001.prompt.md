You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a flaw in its logic that can lead to incorrect outputs. Specifically, the method used to determine the segments of the array relies on the prefix sums not being zero at any intermediate index, which misses certain edge cases where the sum can still be divided correctly despite a prefix sum being zero.

Consider the input array:

```
3
1 -1 0
```

1. The total sum of the array is `0` (leading to the output "NO").
2. However, if one considers the possibility of splitting the array into two parts `[1]` and `[-1, 0]`, both subarrays have non-zero sums.

The algorithm incorrectly outputs "NO" because it fails to recognize that it's possible to partition the array in another valid way when the total sum is `0`. Hence, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all potential input cases.

Thus, since the code can potentially fail under certain conditions, it is not correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100, and A is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range of -1000 to 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` from `0` to `n`, `a` is equal to `A`, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers from input.
    if (prefix_sum[n] == 0) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` from `0` to `n`, `a` is equal to `A`, with `A` being a list of length `n` containing integers, and the value of `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0. If there are values of `r` from 1 to `n` such that `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is equal to the count of such valid `r` values plus 1, `l` is equal to the last valid `r` where the condition held true, and `r` takes its final value after the last iteration of the loop where `r` is equal to `n`. If there are no such `r` values, then `k` remains 1, `l` remains 1, and `r` equals `n`.
        print(k, l, n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is between 1 and 100. If `prefix_sum[n]` is equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `k` is equal to the count of valid `r` values plus 1, or 1 if no valid `r` values exist. `l` takes the last valid `r` value, or remains 1 if no such `r` values exist, and `r` is finally set to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` (between 1 and 100) followed by a list of `n` integers (each between -1000 and 1000). It computes a prefix sum of the list and checks if the total sum of the list (the last element of the prefix sum) is zero. If the total sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and counts the indices `r` where the prefix sum at `r` is not zero and not equal to the total sum, printing these indices along with a final index `n`. It does not return any values but outputs results directly to the console. Additionally, if all prefix sums are zero, only 'NO' is printed, without any further output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
