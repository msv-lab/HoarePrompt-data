The variable `l` is assigned the value of `r`, which is `2`. The previous value of `r` was `2`, so now `l` is also `2`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` from `0` to `n`, `a` is equal to `A`, with `A` being a list of length `n` containing integers, `k` is 3, `l` is 2, `r` is 2, and the output printed is 2 1 2.**
