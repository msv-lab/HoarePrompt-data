The variable `a` becomes a list of integers created by mapping the `input().split()` function, which reads a space-separated string of integers from user input and converts each split element into an integer. The list `A` will now be replaced with the new list assigned to `a`. The variable `n` remains as an integer between 1 and 100, reflecting the length of the newly created list. The previous lengths of `A` and `n` strategically relate to one another but are superseded by the new list. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `A` is now the list of integers from input of length `n`, and `a` is equal to `A` and contains the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `A` is a list of length `n` containing the integers from input; `a` is equal to `A`.**
