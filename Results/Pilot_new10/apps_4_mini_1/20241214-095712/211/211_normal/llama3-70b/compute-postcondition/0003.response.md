According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the loop will run exactly `n` times, with `i` taking values from `0` to `n-1`. The list `A` has a length of `n`, and `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to zeros. 

Since the loop body is omitted, we do not know how `prefix_sum`, `A`, or `a` are modified during the loop. However, at the start of the for loop:
- `i` should start at `0`.
- `n` must be within the specified range (which it is).
- The state of `prefix_sum` is initialized correctly to accommodate the loop execution since it has length `n + 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute correctly, the states that need to be stated include `n`, `i`, and the initialization of the lists. At the start of the loop, `i` is at its initial value of `0`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers from input, `a` is equal to `A`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros**.
