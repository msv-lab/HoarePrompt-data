Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` (between 1 and 100) followed by a list of `n` integers (each between -1000 and 1000). It computes a prefix sum of the list and checks if the total sum of the list (the last element of the prefix sum) is zero. If the total sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and counts the indices `r` where the prefix sum at `r` is not zero and not equal to the total sum, printing these indices along with a final index `n`. It does not return any values but outputs results directly to the console. Additionally, if all prefix sums are zero, only 'NO' is printed, without any further output.**
