According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is between 1 and 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, which makes it 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers from input, `a` is equal to `A`, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `A[0]**
