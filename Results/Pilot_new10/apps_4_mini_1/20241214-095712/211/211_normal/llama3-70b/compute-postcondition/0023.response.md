The `print` statement outputs the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` directly without changing any variables. The values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State maintains all prior conditions valid and includes the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` from `0` to `n`, `a` is equal to `A`, with `A` being a list of length `n` containing integers, `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 2. The output printed is 2 1 2.**
