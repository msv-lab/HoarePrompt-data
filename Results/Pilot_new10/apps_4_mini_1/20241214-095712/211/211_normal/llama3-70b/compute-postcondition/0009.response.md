The loop calculates the prefix sum of the list `a`, storing the cumulative sums in `prefix_sum`. The loop will execute `n` times if `n` is between 1 and 100, resulting in `prefix_sum` being fully populated with the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute fully, resulting in `prefix_sum[n]` being equal to the sum of all elements in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` from `0` to `n`, `a` is equal to `A`, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers from input.**
