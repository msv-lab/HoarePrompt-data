The code is a print statement that outputs the values of `k`, `l`, and `n`. The variables `k`, `l`, and `n` were defined based on the conditions related to the range of `r` values compared to `prefix_sum`. 

Since `print(k, l, n)` does not modify any variables or affect existing states, it simply outputs their current values. Therefore, we need to keep the precondition intact and present the Output State based on the current known values of `k`, `l`, and `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is between 1 and 100.
- Variables `k`, `l`, and `r` depend on the valid counts found during iterations based on `prefix_sum`.

The resulting output will consist of the values of `k`, `l`, and the value range of `n` since their values vary. The specific values of `k` and `l` are not provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100; `k` is equal to the count of valid `r` values plus 1 or 1 if no valid `r`; `l` is equal to the last valid `r`, or remains 1 if no such `r` values exist; `r` takes its final value of `n`**.
