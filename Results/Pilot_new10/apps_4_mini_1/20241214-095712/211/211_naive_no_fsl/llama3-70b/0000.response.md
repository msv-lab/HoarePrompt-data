Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a flaw in its logic that can lead to incorrect outputs. Specifically, the method used to determine the segments of the array relies on the prefix sums not being zero at any intermediate index, which misses certain edge cases where the sum can still be divided correctly despite a prefix sum being zero.

Consider the input array:

```
3
1 -1 0
```

1. The total sum of the array is `0` (leading to the output "NO").
2. However, if one considers the possibility of splitting the array into two parts `[1]` and `[-1, 0]`, both subarrays have non-zero sums.

The algorithm incorrectly outputs "NO" because it fails to recognize that it's possible to partition the array in another valid way when the total sum is `0`. Hence, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all potential input cases.

Thus, since the code can potentially fail under certain conditions, it is not correct.
