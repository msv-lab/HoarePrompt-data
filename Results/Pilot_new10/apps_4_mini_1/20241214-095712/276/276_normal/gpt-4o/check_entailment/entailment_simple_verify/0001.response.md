After analyzing the provided information, the original assessment accurately captures the core functionality and correctness of the program according to the problem description.

### Refined Assessment

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem clearly states the need to compare two numbers in the "golden system" defined by specific rules where each number is a string of '0's and '1's. The computation of these numbers is handled by the function `func_1`.

2. **Function Behavior**: The `func_1` function correctly computes the value of the string in the golden system notation. The way it iterates through the characters of the string and only sums contributions from '1's aligns perfectly with the requirement described in the problem.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The annotations assume the input strings will always be valid (non-empty and made only of '0's and '1's). The behavior for inputs consisting solely of '0's isn't directly a concern since valid inputs according to the prompt will not be empty. The annotations suggest that the state after `func_1` reflects valid outcomes based on valid input according to the assumption made in the original assessment.

4. **Correctness and Comparisons**: The comparison logic works well, as confirmed through example executions. The annotations also support this by showing the final state of values being computed correctly.

Given that all requirements of the problem description are met and the logic of the program remains consistent with expected behavior, the original assessment stands valid. The program computes the values accurately and performs the necessary comparisons correctly.

### Conclusion

Final: **True**
