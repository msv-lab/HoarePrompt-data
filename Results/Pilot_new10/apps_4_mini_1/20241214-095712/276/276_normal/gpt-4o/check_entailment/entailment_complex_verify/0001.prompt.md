You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)
if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
    return value


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we can follow a step-by-step analysis.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to compare two numbers represented in a unique binary-like system (golden system), where:
- Each number is a string of '0's and '1's.
- The value of a number `a_0a_1...a_n` is calculated as: 
  \[
  \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n - i}
  \]
  where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).

The output should be ">", "<", or "=" depending on the comparison of the two computed values.

### Code Analysis
1. The program reads two strings `s1` and `s2`.
2. It computes their values using a helper function `func_1(s)`, which:
   - Initializes `value` to 0.
   - Iterates over the string's length, checking if the character is '1'. If it is, it adds \( q^{(n - i - 1)} \) (i.e., the contribution of that digit).
3. After computing both values, it compares them and prints the appropriate symbol.

### Checking for Edge Cases
The main concern is whether the `func_1` function correctly computes the value for all valid inputs. Here are key considerations:

- If the string consists solely of '0's, the value returned should be 0, but since the input is guaranteed to be a non-empty string comprising only '0's and '1's, this edge case doesn't directly apply.
- The order of digits is considered significant; thus "00100" is not the same as "11" because it contributes differently to the total value (which the function handles correctly by excluding '0's).
- The program uses Python's arbitrary-precision floats for the calculation, but extensive calculations could lead to precision issues, especially if both strings are at the maximum length (100,000).

### Checking Potential Case
For an input, I can consider:
- Input:
  ```
  1000000
  111
  ```
  
Here:
- `s1 = "1000000"` translates to approximately \( q^{6} \) (since 6 digits total) which is significant.
- `s2 = "111"` translates to roughly \( q^{2} + q^{1} + q^{0} \).

Calculating these:
- \( q^{6} \) is approximately \( 17.944... \)
- \( q^{2} + q^{1} + q^{0} \) is \( q^2 + q + 1 \approx 5.236... \)

Therefore, `1000000` should be larger than `111`, and the program should output ">" which it does after the calculation. 

### Conclusion
After checking the logic and calculating the value for the indicated test case, the program appears to function correctly for the provided examples. The precision issues could affect performance but not correctness in the context of the problem. 

Since I couldn't find a counterexample or edge case where the program fails to deliver expected results based on the given prompt, we can conclude that the program works correctly according to the problem specifications.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)
if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a tuple containing two non-empty strings made up of '0' and '1' characters, each of which has a length not exceeding 100,000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a tuple of two non-empty strings made up of '0' and '1'; `value` is either approximately 1.618033988749895 or 2.618033988749895, depending on the values of `s[0]` and `s[1]` respectively, `q` remains approximately 1.618033988749895, and `n` is 2. If both `s[0]` and `s[1]` are '0', then `value` remains 0.
    return value
    #The program returns either approximately 1.618033988749895 or 2.618033988749895, depending on the values of s[0] and s[1]; if both are '0', then it returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty strings made up of '0' and '1'. It calculates and returns a value based on the strings: if both strings are '0', it returns 0; if one string is '1' and the other is '0', it returns approximately 1.618033988749895; if both strings are '1', it returns approximately 2.618033988749895.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
