You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)
if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
    return value


```
Original Assessment: Let's analyze the given Python program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

The program defines a function `func_1` that converts a binary-like string (in a "golden system") into its decimal value according to the specified formula involving the golden ratio \( q \). The program then compares the resulting values of two such strings provided as input. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two non-empty strings containing only '0's and '1's.
2. **Function Calculation**:
   - The golden ratio \( q \) is calculated.
   - The program evaluates the value of the string by summing \( q^{n-i} \) for each '1' found in the string, where \( n \) is the length of the string and \( i \) is the index of the character.
3. **Comparison**:
   - It compares the two computed values of the two golden system inputs and prints the result accordingly.

### Potential Issues
1. **Order of Operations**: The current implementation computes the value for the strings as they are, but it doesn't handle cases where the number of leading zeros can affect correct interpretation. For example,:
   - For string inputs like "00001" and "1", the former should still equal the latter according to the golden system, but the way the function is designed, it sums powers of \( q \) only for '1's. Hence, leading zeros will not affect the result, which is correct.
  
2. **Computational Precision**: Given that the length of the input can be up to 100,000, there could be potential overflow or rounding issues with floating point representation when calculating high powers of \( q \). But, since the problem doesn't specify the need for high precision or how to handle such cases, the current implementation can still be considered as robust.

3. **Edge Cases**: If we consider the minimal input, "1" and "1", they should yield '=' which is correctly handled by the program. The input strings simply being "1" or "0" are also handled correctly. The edge cases for very long strings made up entirely of zeroes before a single '1' are accounted for, and would return the expected decimal equivalence.

### Conclusion
Upon evaluating these aspects:

- The program handles all stated functionality of reading the strings, evaluating the specified formula, and compares the outputs correctly.
- There are no immediate potential failure points that come to light, even when testing extreme cases, meaning the behavior is consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the required conversion and comparison functionality for the "golden system".

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty strings made up of '0' and '1'. It calculates and returns a value based on the strings: if both strings are '0', it returns 0; if one string is '1' and the other is '0', it returns approximately 1.618033988749895; if both strings are '1', it returns approximately 2.618033988749895. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
