The original assessment concluded that the program correctly implements the required comparison functionality for the "golden system". Upon reviewing the provided output hints, it becomes clear that they significantly differ from the stated functionality of the `func_1` and the overall problem description.

### Key Discrepancies:
1. **Function Input Handling**: The output hint describes `func_1` as accepting a tuple containing two strings, which is incorrect. The function actually accepts a single string at a time. 
2. **Return Values**: The output hints suggest that the function returns fixed values when both strings are '0' or '1', which does not align with the original designed behavior of calculating based on the powers of \( q \). For instance, if both strings are '0', the function does not return 0; the comparison is based on the values computed for each string regardless of leading zeros.
3. **Approximation Issues**: The hints suggest specific approximate return values for combinations of inputs, which would not be the outputs of a correctly implemented version of the function based on the mathematical description provided.

The original assessment wrongly concluded that the output behavior aligns with the problem description when, in fact, it does not take into account the errors in the output hints that indicate a misunderstanding of function behavior and output.

### Final Assessment:
After consideration of the original assessment in light of the output hints, it is evident that the implementation fails to perform correctly as intended for all cases outlined in the problem description.

Final: **False**
