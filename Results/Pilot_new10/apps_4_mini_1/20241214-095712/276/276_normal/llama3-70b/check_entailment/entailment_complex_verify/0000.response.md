Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately highlights the potential issues related to floating-point precision in the context of comparing large values derived from the golden system notation. However, given the provided annotations, it is evident that the program correctly processes the input strings and converts them into decimal values based on the golden ratio. 

Moreover, the critical observation that the function `func_1` indeed converts each string independently and compares their outcomes correctly leads to a conclusion that, under the assumption of valid and correctly formatted input strings, it will operate within expected behavior. Therefore, while the original assessment acknowledged a valid concern, it does not dismiss the basic correctness of the programâ€™s structure and fundamental comparisons.

As a result, my assessment confirms that the program will likely yield the correct results for valid inputs as specified in the problem description.
