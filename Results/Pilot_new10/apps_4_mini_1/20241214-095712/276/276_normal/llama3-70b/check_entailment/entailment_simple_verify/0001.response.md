Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately determined that the program correctly implements the logic to compare numbers in the "golden system". The provided code successfully converts the binary strings to their respective decimal values using the function `func_1`, which properly applies the golden ratio formula. 

The annotations confirm that:
1. The input consists of valid binary strings, and the lengths do not exceed the specified maximum of 100,000 characters.
2. The `func_1` function processes these strings correctly, producing a proper decimal representation for comparison, as stated in the problem description.
3. The handling of leading zeros does not affect the correctness of the output since they are trimmed in the conversion process inherently.

Overall, the program handles comparisons as intended, and the potential edge cases regarding numerical precision due to the floating-point arithmetic are appropriately addressed given the use of relative comparison. Hence, the original assessment's conclusion of correctness stands valid.
