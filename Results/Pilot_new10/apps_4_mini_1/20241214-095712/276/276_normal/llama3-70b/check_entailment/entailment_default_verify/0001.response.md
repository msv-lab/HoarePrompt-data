The original assessment states that the program is correct, and the analysis of the code suggests that it properly implements logic to compare numbers in the golden system. However, the output hints indicate that the function `func_1` only processes the first binary string from a tuple and completely ignores the second binary string, which is a critical flaw.

Given that the function only processes the first string and does not utilize the second input string for any conversion or comparison, the program cannot accurately determine which of the two golden system numbers is larger.

This oversight in the output hints shows a significant discrepancy between the program's intended functionality and what it actually performs. Therefore, the original assessment claiming correctness is fundamentally inaccurate.

Final: **False**
