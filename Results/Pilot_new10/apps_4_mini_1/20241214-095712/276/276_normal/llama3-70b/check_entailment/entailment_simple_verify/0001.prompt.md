You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
    return decimal


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the given program is correctly implementing the logic to compare numbers in the "golden system", we need to analyze the provided code and identify if there are any cases where it might fail.

The program reads two binary strings `a` and `b`, converts them from the golden system to decimal using the function `func_1`, and then compares these decimal values, printing the appropriate relationship (`>`, `<`, or `=`) based on the comparison.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Functionality of `func_1`:**
   The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` and converts it to its decimal representation using the golden ratio `q = (sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`. It uses a loop with `enumerate(reversed(s))` to iterate through the characters of the string from the last to the first (which simulates the exponent in the golden system expansion).

2. **Correctness of Conversion:**
   - The function correctly iterates through the string and computes the sum as described by the golden system formula, where each binary digit contributes `a_i * q^(n-i)`.
   - The numerical calculation uses the `q ** i`, which correctly applies the powers of the golden ratio to each bit, regardless of its position in the string.

3. **Potential Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not handle leading zeros in the input strings, but this is acceptable since both numbers can be represented regardless of leading zeros. Leading zeros do not contribute to the value of the number in binary/decimal representation and thus do not affect the comparison.
   - Care should be taken with floating-point arithmetic when comparing very large powers of `q`, but since both numbers are processed in the same way and the comparison is relative, precision should not hinder correctness.

4. **Performance:** 
   The function operates in linear time relative to the length of the strings, ensuring it can handle the maximum constraint (100,000 characters) efficiently.

### Conclusion:
Considering the above analysis and the lack of edge cases that would lead to incorrect behavior in the implementation, the function should work as intended for all valid inputs conforming to the problem description.

Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `decimal` is the converted decimal value based on the binary strings in `s`, `i` is the total number of bits processed minus one, `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings of '0' and '1' characters.
    return decimal
    #The program returns the converted decimal value based on the binary strings in tuple 's', where 'i' represents the total number of bits processed minus one.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
