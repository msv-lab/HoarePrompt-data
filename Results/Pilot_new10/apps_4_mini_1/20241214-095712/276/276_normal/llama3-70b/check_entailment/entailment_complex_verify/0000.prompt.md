You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
    return decimal


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program according to the given problem description, we will analyze the logic and handling of potential edge cases.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to compare two numbers written in a unique "golden system" notation, which consists only of the digits '0' and '1'. The decimal value of the golden number is calculated using the formula involving the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). 

### Program Analysis
1. The program correctly takes two input strings representing golden numbers.
2. It defines a function `func_1` that calculates the decimal value of a given golden number string. 
3. The function properly reverses the string and calculates the value by summing \( a_i \cdot q^{n-i} \) for each digit, where \( a_i \) is either 0 or 1.
4. The main part of the program compares the two decimal values and outputs whether the first is larger, smaller, or equal to the second.

### Potential Issues
1. **Accuracy of Decimal Comparisons**: The floating-point arithmetic in Python can lead to precision issues, especially given that the number strings can be quite long (up to 100,000 characters). This can particularly affect the calculation of \( q^i \) for large values of \( i \), which will be used to evaluate large powers of the golden ratio. In the context of mathematical comparison, these errors can lead to incorrect comparison results in some edge cases.
   
2. **Leading Zeros**: The program does not explicitly handle leading zeros in the input strings, but since the strings are processed correctly in terms of calculation, it may not pose a functional issue in this context.

### Conclusion
Given that there could be floating-point inaccuracies that affect the outcome of decimal comparisons, especially when dealing with long strings, the program can fail in specific cases where two decimal values that should be equal end up being slightly different due to precision errors.

**Correctness: **False**. 

**Example case where it could fail:** 
Consider two long golden numbers that should be equal mathematically but due to floating-point precision issues, they could be computed as slightly different when evaluated using the function. For instance:

- Input: `1` and `1.000...0` (where the second one has a large number of trailing zeros). Due to floating-point representation in Python, these could end up being compared inaccurately.

Thus, the program does not ensure accurate handling of comparisons within the expected constraints leading to a scenario where the output could be incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `decimal` is the converted decimal value based on the binary strings in `s`, `i` is the total number of bits processed minus one, `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings of '0' and '1' characters.
    return decimal
    #The program returns the converted decimal value based on the binary strings in tuple 's', where 'i' represents the total number of bits processed minus one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty binary strings of '0' and '1' characters and converts the first string into its decimal representation using the golden ratio as a base for the conversion. It returns the resulting decimal value. Note that while the function accepts two binary strings, it only processes the first one for conversion; the second string is ignored.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
