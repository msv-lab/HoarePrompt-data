The output hints provide an important insight into the implementation of the function `func_1`. They indicate that the function only processes the first string within a tuple of two non-empty binary strings, while the second string is ignored. This is problematic because the program is designed to compare two numbers, yet it does not correctly handle the second input string, which means that the output can be based only on the first input's conversion, leading to inaccurate results.

Given this crucial flaw, the program fails to meet the problem description of comparing two numbers accurately. The original assessment correctly identified precision issues but incorrectly implied that the program still fundamentally processes both inputs. 

To summarize:
1. The program is designed to compare two golden numbers, but it only processes the first input string.
2. Since it only computes the decimal value of one string and ignores the other, the program cannot provide accurate results for the specified input scenario.

Thus, the initial assessment should be updated as the program fundamentally fails to satisfy the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
