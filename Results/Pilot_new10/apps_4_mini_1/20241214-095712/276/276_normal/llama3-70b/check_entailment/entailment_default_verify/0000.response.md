The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program related to floating-point precision when comparing values derived from the golden system. The output hints, however, introduce another significant issue: they suggest that the function `func_1` only processes the first binary string in a tuple (which is not true based on the provided code), and it implies that the second string is ignored, which is misleading given that the program explicitly processes both strings for comparison.

Considering these discrepancies, the program does not fulfill its intended functionality as described in the problem statement because:
1. It might not output correct comparisons due to floating-point inaccuracies.
2. The output hints suggest a misinterpretation of how the function should work, further obscuring the program's reliability.

Thus, I uphold the original assessment's conclusion regarding the correctness of the program, as the issues with floating-point comparison could lead to inaccuracies.

Final: **False**
