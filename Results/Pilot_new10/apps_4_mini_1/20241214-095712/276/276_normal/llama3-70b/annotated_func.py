#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `decimal` is the converted decimal value based on the binary strings in `s`, `i` is the total number of bits processed minus one, `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings of '0' and '1' characters.
    return decimal
    #The program returns the converted decimal value based on the binary strings in tuple 's', where 'i' represents the total number of bits processed minus one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty binary strings of '0' and '1' characters and converts the first string into its decimal representation using the golden ratio as a base for the conversion. It returns the resulting decimal value. Note that while the function accepts two binary strings, it only processes the first one for conversion; the second string is ignored.
