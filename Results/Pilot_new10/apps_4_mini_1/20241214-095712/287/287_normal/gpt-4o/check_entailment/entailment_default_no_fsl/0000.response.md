Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description, which requires calculating the number of different weights of splits of the integer `n`. Instead, the program calculates the total number of divisors of `n`, which is not relevant to the task.

For instance, when given the input `7`, the expected output according to the problem description is `4` because the different weights of splits are `1`, `2`, `3`, and `7`. However, the program will output `4` but for reasons that are not aligned with the requirement to find weights of splits.

Further, the logic of counts and how the results relate to splits is completely misaligned. The specified output hints mention that the function counts divisors, which it does correctly, but this is not what the problem is asking for. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem requirements for every potential case, confirming its incorrectness.
