`count` is incremented by 1. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and the condition regarding `num` remains valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` must be greater than or equal to (current i)^2 or num must be larger than or equal to the square of the incremented value of i, and `count` is incremented by 1. 

Output State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to (current i)^2 or num must be larger than or equal to the square of the incremented value of i; `count` is incremented by 1.**
