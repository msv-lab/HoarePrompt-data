The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `num` is either greater than or equal to `(current i)^2` or larger than or equal to the square of the incremented value of `i`. The impact of the code does not change the state of `num` or `count`, but the value of `i` is updated. 

Output State: **`num` is greater than or equal to (current i)^2 or larger than or equal to the square of the incremented value of i; `i` is incremented by 1.**
