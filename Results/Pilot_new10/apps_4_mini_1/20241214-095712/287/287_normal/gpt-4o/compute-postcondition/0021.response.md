The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is not specified, but the information that `i` has been incremented by 1 indicates that the new value of `i` will be greater by 1 than its previous state. Other variables (`num`, `count`) remain unchanged, but the condition about `num` being greater than or equal to (i + 1)² still holds true, considering the increment.

Output State: **`num` is greater than or equal to (i + 1)²; `i` has been incremented by 1.**
