The value of `i` is initialized to 1. The states of the other variables, `num` and `count`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 0, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 0, `i` is 1**.
