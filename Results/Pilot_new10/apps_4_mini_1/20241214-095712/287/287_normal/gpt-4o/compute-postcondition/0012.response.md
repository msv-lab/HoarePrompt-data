The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `count` was an integer, and now it will be one integer greater. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to (current i)^2 or num must be larger than or equal to the square of the incremented value of i; `count` is incremented by 1.**
