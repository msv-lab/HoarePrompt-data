Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9) and outputs the total number of divisors of `n`. It calculates the number of divisors by iterating from 1 to the square root of `n`, counting both the divisor and its complement, while adjusting for perfect squares. It does not return a value; instead, it prints the result directly. **
