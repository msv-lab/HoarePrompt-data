According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 2, which implies that `n` must be at least 1. Given the provided condition that `1 <= n <= 10^9`, `n` can take any value within this range, hence the loop will always have a valid start.

The variable `i` will start from 1 at the first iteration. As for `res` and the given bounds for `n`, the loop does not directly affect `res` during the initialization. Therefore, the relevant states are `n` being at least 1, and `i` starting at 1.

State: **`n` is any integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is 1**
