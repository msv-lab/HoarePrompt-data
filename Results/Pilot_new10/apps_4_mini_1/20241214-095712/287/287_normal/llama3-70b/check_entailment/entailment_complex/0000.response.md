The provided annotated program calculates the number of divisors of an integer \( n \) rather than the number of different weights of its splits, as described in the problem description. 

The problem requires counting the different weights of all possible splits of \( n \), where a split is defined as a non-increasing sequence of positive integers summing to \( n \), and the weight of a split is the count of elements equal to the first element of the split. 

In the program:
1. The function reads an integer \( n \).
2. It initializes a counter `res` and then iterates from \( 1 \) to \( \sqrt{n} \) to count divisors.
3. It increases the count for each divisor and adjusts for perfect squares.

The logic for calculating the number of divisors does not correspond with the task of determining the different weights of splits. 

**Example of Incorrectness**: 
- For \( n = 8 \), the correct output according to the problem description is 5 (considering weights 1 through 5) based on the valid splits of 8. However, the provided program would output the number of divisors of 8, which is 4 (since 1, 2, 4, and 8 are the divisors).

Thus, the function does not satisfy the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**
