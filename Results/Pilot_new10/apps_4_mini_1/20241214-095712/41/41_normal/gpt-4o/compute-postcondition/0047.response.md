Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, where `n` is the number of participants (2 <= n <= 1000). It reads the ratings before (array `a`) and after (array `b`) a round for each participant. It determines if the round is 'rated' (if any participant's before rating `a[i]` is different from their after rating `b[i]`), 'unrated' (if all before and after ratings are equal but at least one participant has an increasing before rating compared to the previous participant), or 'maybe' (if all before and after ratings are equal and there is no increase).**
