Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of `(a[i], b[i])` for each participant; `is_rated` is False; `is_unrated` is True; `i` is 3, and if `ratings[i - 1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
