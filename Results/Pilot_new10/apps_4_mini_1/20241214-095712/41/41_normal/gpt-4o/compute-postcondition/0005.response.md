`a` and `b` are assigned values based on user input, where the input contains two integers separated by a space. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Other variables, such as the loop variable, are not affected by this assignment. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` and `b` are assigned values as integers derived from the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is an integer from input; `b` is an integer from input.**
