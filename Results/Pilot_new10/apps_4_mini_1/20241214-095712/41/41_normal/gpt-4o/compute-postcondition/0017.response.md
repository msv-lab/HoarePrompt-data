The code `ratings.append((a, b))` adds the tuple `(a, b)` to the list `ratings`. The values of `a` and `b` are input integers, and if `a` is not equal to `b`, then the tuple is appended to the ratings, and `is_rated` is set to True. However, since the initial conditions state that if `a` equals `b`, `ratings` remain unchanged and `is_rated` is not updated, the effect of this line depends on the relationship between `a` and `b`.

1. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `ratings` now includes `(a, b)`, and `is_rated` is set to True.
2. If `a` equals `b`, then `ratings` remain unchanged and `is_rated` is not affected.

Given that we only have a single line of code with no other information about the values of `a` and `b` or the initial contents of `ratings`, we cannot definitively state the output state. However, we can express the output state based on the possibilities:

- If `a != b`:
    - `ratings` is updated to include `(a, b)`, and `is_rated` is True.
    
- If `a == b`:
    - `ratings` remains unchanged and `is_rated` remains unchanged (not set to True).

Since we cannot know the values of `a` or `b`, we cannot provide a concrete output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 999; `a` and `b` are input integers; if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `ratings` includes `(a, b)` and `is_rated` is set to True; if `a` equals `b`, then `ratings` remain unchanged and `is_rated` is not updated.**
