For the loop to execute, we need to consider the parameters in the loop statement. The `for j in range(i + 1, n)` statement will iterate over a range starting from `i + 1` to `n - 1`. 

### Step by Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is given as 1.
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
   - `j` is initialized as `n - 1`.
   - `unrated` is set to False, which does not affect the loop execution.

2. **Calculation of Range**:
   - The start point for `j` will be `i + 1`, which equals `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - The end point for `j` is `n`. Thus, the `range` would be from 2 to `n` (exclusive of `n`).

3. **Condition for Executing the Loop**:
   - For the loop to execute, the start point (2) must be less than the end point (`n`).
   - Therefore, we need `n` to be at least 3 for the range to contain any values, meaning `n` must be greater than 2.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to indicate that `n` is at least 3. The loop will then execute, iterating from `j = 2` up to `j = n - 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `unrated` is False**
