To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we can analyze the loopâ€™s behavior based on the provided initial state and loop code.

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings_before` is an empty list; `ratings_after` is an empty list.

The loop iterates `n` times, which means two integers `a` and `b` will be inputted and appended to `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` respectively for each iteration. 

After all iterations have been executed:

- `n` remains the same as it defines the number of iterations (between 2 and 1000).
- `ratings_before` will contain `n` elements, each being the input integer `a` from each loop iteration.
- `ratings_after` will contain `n` elements, each being the input integer `b` from each loop iteration, which may vary for each iteration but will be exactly `n` in total as well.

Thus, after the loop completes its operation, both lists will contain `n` input values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings_before` contains `n` instances of input integers `a`; `ratings_after` contains `n` instances of input integers `b`.**
