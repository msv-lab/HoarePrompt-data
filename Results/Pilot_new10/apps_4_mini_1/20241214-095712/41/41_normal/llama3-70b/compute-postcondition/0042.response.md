Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `unrated` is False. If the value of `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and the value of `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part in the code.***
