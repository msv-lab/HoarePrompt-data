The code appends the value of `a` to the `ratings_before` list. The initial state indicates that `ratings_before` is an empty list, and since `a` is an input integer, it will be added to the list. Therefore, the state of `ratings_before` will now contain the value of `a` while other variables retain their previous statuses.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` contains `a`, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.
