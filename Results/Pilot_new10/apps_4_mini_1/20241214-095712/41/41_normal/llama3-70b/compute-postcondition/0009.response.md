The code `ratings_before.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and `ratings_before` initially contains `a`. By appending `a` to itself, the list `ratings_before` will now contain two instances of `a`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` contains two instances of `a`, and `ratings_after` still contains `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings_before` contains two instances of `a`; `ratings_after` contains `b`.**
