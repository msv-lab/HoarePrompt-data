Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `unrated` is False. If the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` holds true, we break out of the most internal loop or block. Otherwise, there are no changes made to the variables or the program's state.***
