In the provided code snippet, `ratings_before.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the end of the list `ratings_before`. The variable `ratings_before` previously contained two instances of `input_a`, and it will now contain `input_a` twice plus the value of `a`. The other variables do not change. 

Thus, the updated output state reflects that `ratings_before` now has three elements: two instances of `input_a` and one instance of `a`. The values of `n`, `ratings_after`, and `_` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings_before` contains two instances of `input_a` and `a`; `ratings_after` contains `input_b` and the previous elements; `_` is 1.**
