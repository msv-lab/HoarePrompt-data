According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is between 2 and 1000, the loop can execute for the next iteration. After the last iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1. Additionally, since there are no restrictions indicated for `n`, it remains the same. 

State: **`unrated` is False, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1**
