Postcondition: ***`unrated` is False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and if the condition holds that `ratings_before[1]` is less than any of `ratings_before[j]` for `j` in the range `i + 1` to `n`, while simultaneously `ratings_after[1]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]` for those same indices, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If no such pair exists, `unrated` remains False, and the loop has completed without conditions being met.***
