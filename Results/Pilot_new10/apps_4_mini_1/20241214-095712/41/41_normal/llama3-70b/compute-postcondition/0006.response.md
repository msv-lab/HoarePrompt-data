The code takes the value of `b` (which is an input integer) and appends it to the `ratings_after` list. The values of `n`, `ratings_before`, and the initial state of `ratings_after` do not change except for the addition of the new element to `ratings_after`. Therefore, the output state remains mostly the same with the update that `ratings_after` now contains one element, which is the value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` contains `a`, `ratings_after` contains `b`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
