According to the code, for the loop to execute, the state of `n` is crucial. As stated, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, meaning it is already a valid value that allows the loop to execute multiple times. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment on each iteration. 

Since the execution of the loop does not depend on the values of `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, or the boolean flags (`rated`, `unrated`, `maybe`), those states do not need adjustments for the loop execution. 

Thus, before the loop starts, the state should reflect the starting value of `i` as well, which begins at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0**
