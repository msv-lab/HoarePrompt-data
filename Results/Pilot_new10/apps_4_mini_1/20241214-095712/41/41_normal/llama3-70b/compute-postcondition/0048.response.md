The value of `unrated` is assigned to be `False`, but it already holds the value `False` based on the initial state. Since this assignment does not change the value of `unrated`, the other variables remain unaffected, and we are left with the initial conditions still valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `unrated` is False**
