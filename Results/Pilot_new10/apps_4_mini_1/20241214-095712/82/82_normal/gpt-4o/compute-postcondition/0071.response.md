The value of `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. No other variables are directly affected by this assignment, so the output state remains consistent with the conditions specified prior to execution. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is `abs(a - b)`; `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions; `new_a` is computed as `(a + (abs(a - b) // k) - 1) // (abs(a - b) // k) * (abs(a - b) // k)`; `new_b` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`; `current_lcm` is the output of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
