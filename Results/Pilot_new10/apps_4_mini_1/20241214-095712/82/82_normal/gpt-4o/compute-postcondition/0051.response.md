The function `func_2(new_a, new_b)` is called with `new_a` and `new_b` as parameters. This function presumably computes the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`. The value of `current_lcm` will be updated to the result of this function call. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Thus, the relevant details mean that after the execution of the code, we know that `current_lcm` is now the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `current_lcm` is now the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is updated accordingly, `min_k` is updated accordingly, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `new_a` is a positive multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`.**
