According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`. The loop variable `candidate` will take on the first value `k` during the first iteration and then the second value `diff // k` in the next iteration if the loop executes again. Since `candidate` is the loop variable, it will be updated to `diff // k` in the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, and `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions. After this iteration, we need to consider whether the loop can execute again with the next value of `candidate`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions, and `candidate` is `diff // k`**.
