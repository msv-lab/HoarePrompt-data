Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` for all candidates checked, `min_k` is the candidate associated with the minimum `min_lcm`. If the loop does not execute, then `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
