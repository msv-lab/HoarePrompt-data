The variable `new_a` is assigned the value `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Given that `candidate` is equal to `diff`, which itself is equal to `abs(a - b)`, we can express `new_a` as `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, `k`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, and `min_k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `k` is set to 1, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`, `candidate` is `diff // 1` (which is `diff`); `new_a` is `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`.**
