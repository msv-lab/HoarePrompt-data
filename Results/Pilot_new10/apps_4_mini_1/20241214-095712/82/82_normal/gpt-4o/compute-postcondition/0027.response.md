The code `min_lcm = current_lcm` assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. Since `min_lcm` is being updated directly to the value of `current_lcm`, and no other variables are affected, the output state will reflect this change. 

The initial conditions for the variables remain valid after this assignment, but the value of `min_lcm` is now explicitly equal to that of `current_lcm`. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `k` is 1, `new_a` is updated to `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `min_k` is set to `diff`, `candidate` is equal to `diff`.**
