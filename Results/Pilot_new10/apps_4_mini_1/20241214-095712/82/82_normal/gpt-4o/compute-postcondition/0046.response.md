The initial value of `min_k` is now assigned the value of `candidate`. All other variables remain unchanged. The state of `candidate` can be derived from `diff` and `k`, but no specifics are provided in the statement regarding their exact values. 

Since we are only updating `min_k`, the output will reflect its new value, which is dependent on `candidate`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new assignment.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
