According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `candidate` values generated from the list `[k, diff // k]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have established that `a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is assigned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is assigned a value based on the comparison of `current_lcm` and `candidate`.

In the current state, the list of candidates contains two elements: `k` and `diff // k`. Since we are iterating over these candidates, we need to consider which candidates we've processed and what state we need for the next iteration.

The loop will execute again if there is another candidate to process. Since `candidate` has already been set to one of those values in the last iteration, it would typically need to be adjusted to the next candidate value for another execution. 

If we assume the loop has iterated through the first candidate `k`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `candidate` should now be `diff // k`.

Thus, updating the state involves noting that we are now on the second candidate:

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and candidate is `diff // k`.**
