To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the initial conditions and the impact of the code.

Initial State:
- `a` is a positive integer
- `b` is a positive integer
- `diff` is `abs(a - b)`
- `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`
- `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`
- `candidate` is `diff // k`
- `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
- `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`

Now examining the code segment:
```
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

Here, `current_lcm` is updated to the value returned by the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, which computes the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` depend on the values of `a`, `b`, and `candidate`.

- The values for `new_a` and `new_b` are defined by formulas involving `candidate` and can lead to specific positive integers as results, but their exact values cannot be determined just from knowing `a`, `b`, and `candidate`.
- The variable `min_lcm` will also have the same value as `current_lcm` after this assignment.

Since `current_lcm` is directly dependent on the execution of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, we must denote that a value from this function is now represented in our state.

Taking this into account, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
