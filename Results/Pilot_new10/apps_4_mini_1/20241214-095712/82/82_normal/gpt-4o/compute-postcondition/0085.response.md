The function `func_3` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, the function immediately returns 0. If `a` and `b` are not equal, the function calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and iterates through potential divisors (candidates) of this difference to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of modified values of `a` and `b`. The function returns the candidate associated with the minimum LCM found, or 0 if no valid candidates produce a valid LCM computation.

The code does not handle the case where no candidates provide a valid LCM due to the function `func_2` potentially returning a value that does not allow determining a minimum. Additionally, the code implicitly expects `func_2` to operate correctly and return meaningful results for inputs derived from `new_a` and `new_b`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns 0 if they are equal; otherwise, it returns the candidate associated with the minimum least common multiple of modified `a` and `b`, or 0 if no valid candidates are considered. **
