To analyze the given Python code snippet in the context of the initial state, we need to calculate the new value of `new_a` based on the relationship set out in the code.

We start with the following initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `diff` is defined as `abs(a - b)`.
- `previous_k` satisfies specified conditions.
- `new_a` is computed as `(a + k - 1) // k * k`.
- `new_b` is the next multiple of `k` greater than or equal to `b`.
- `current_lcm` is the output of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- `candidate` is `diff // k`.

The operation of the code snippet is:
```
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```
Here, `candidate` is `diff // k` (as already established).

1. The value of `new_a` will be computed based on the formula `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
2. Since `candidate` is derived from `diff`, we can simplify:
   - `candidate` = `diff // k` = `abs(a - b) // k`.

Now applying this to the formula for `new_a`:
- `new_a` = `(a + (abs(a - b) // k) - 1) // (abs(a - b) // k) * (abs(a - b) // k)`

Only `new_a` is updated based on `a` and `candidate`. Thus, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions, `new_a` is computed as `(a + (abs(a - b) // k) - 1) // (abs(a - b) // k) * (abs(a - b) // k)`, `new_b` is the next multiple of `k` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the output of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `candidate` is `diff // k`**.
