The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. After executing the function body, if `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function returns `min_k`, which is the candidate associated with the minimum least common multiple, or 0 if no candidates were considered. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, returning 0 if they are equal, and returning a candidate associated with the minimum least common multiple or 0 if no candidates were considered when they are not equal. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It returns 0 if `a` is equal to `b`; otherwise, it returns `min_k`, which is the candidate associated with the minimum least common multiple or 0 if no candidates were considered.**
