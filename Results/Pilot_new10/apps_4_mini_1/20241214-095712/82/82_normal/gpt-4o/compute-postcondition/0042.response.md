Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step based on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `diff` is `abs(a - b)`.
- `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.
- `candidate` is `diff // k`.

Now, we focus on the line of code provided:
```python
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```

1. **Calculation of `new_a`:** 
   - The variable `new_a` is assigned a value based on the calculation `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
   - Here, `candidate` has already been defined as `diff // k`, and since `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, it implies that `candidate` is a multiple of `k`.
   - The expression `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate` effectively computes how many full `candidate` values fit into `a` after adjusting for potential integer division.
   - This means `new_a` can be seen as the next multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

The values of the other variables (`b`, `diff`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `candidate`) remain unchanged. Thus, we need to present the new state.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, and `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
