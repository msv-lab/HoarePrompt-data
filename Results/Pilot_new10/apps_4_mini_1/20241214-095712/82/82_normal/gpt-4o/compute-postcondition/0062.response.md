Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `previous_k` satisfies the conditions given, `new_a` is computed as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the output of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, or it is equal to `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
