The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. The states of the other variables are not affected, and their values remain the same. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the positive value equal to `abs(a - b)`, and `min_lcm` is equal to `float('inf')`.**
