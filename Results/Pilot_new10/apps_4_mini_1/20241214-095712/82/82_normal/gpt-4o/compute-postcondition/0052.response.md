The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `min_lcm` now holds the same value as `current_lcm`, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `current_lcm` is now the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated accordingly, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `new_a` is a positive multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`.**
