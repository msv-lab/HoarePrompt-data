#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, the loop executed until `b` became 0, initially `a` and `b` must have been positive integers between 1 and 10^9.
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of 'a' and 'b', with 'b' being 0, which means 'a' is the final GCD value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. It continues to loop until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns `a` as the GCD. The function handles the input values constrained between 1 and \(10^9\) and correctly computes the GCD according to the Euclidean algorithm.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the result of a multiplied by b divided by the result of func_1(a, b), where a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the result of multiplying `a` by `b` and then dividing by the output of `func_1(a, b)`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is unknown based on this snippet, potential edge cases such as division by zero cannot be determined. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function would encounter a runtime error.
