The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, constrained by the conditions that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, it returns the result of \((a \times b) \div \text{func\_1}(a, b)\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the value obtained by multiplying `a` and `b` and then dividing it by the result of the function `func_1` called with these same parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, and returns the result of a multiplied by b divided by the result of func_1(a, b).**
