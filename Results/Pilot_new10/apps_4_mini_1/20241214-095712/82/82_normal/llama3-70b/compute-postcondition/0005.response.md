`a` is updated to the current value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the remainder of `a` divided by the current value of `b`. Since `b_initial` is the initial value of `b`, and `a_initial % b_initial` is the initial value of `b`, we can represent the new values of `a` and `b` as follows:

- New `a` is `b_initial`.
- New `b` is `a_initial % b_initial`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is `b_initial`, `b` is the remainder of `a_initial` divided by `b_initial`.

Output State: **`a` is `b_initial`, `b` is `a_initial % b_initial`**
