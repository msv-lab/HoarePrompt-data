Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the string `s` from input. It respects the specified bounds of the problem, as it requires that `4 ≤ n ≤ 255`.

2. **Counting Nucleotides**: The program employs a dictionary to count the occurrences of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in string `s`. This is necessary to determine how many of each nucleotide are currently present before addressing the unrecognized nucleotides represented by '?'.

3. **Calculating Target Counts**: It calculates the average count for each nucleotide that is required to achieve balance, using `avg = n // 4`. This step is essential because to meet the requirements of the problem, each nucleotide must be present an equal number of times in the final string.

4. **Replacing Unrecognized Nucleotides**: The nested loops within the program replace the '?' characters with the needed nucleotides one by one, as specified by the counts calculated previously. The loop correctly handles the replacement while ensuring that the counts in the dictionary do not fall below zero, which is crucial for maintaining the balance of nucleotides.

5. **Final Output Handling**: After attempting to replace all '?', the program checks the counts dictionary. If any counts remain greater than zero after processing, this indicates that it was not possible to achieve the required balance, and the program outputs "===" as required by the problem description. If it is possible to achieve balance, it prints the modified string.

6. **Correctness for All Cases**: The logic in the program accounts for edge cases, including:
   - When `s` consists entirely of '?'.
   - When `s` initially has a balanced number of nucleotides.
   - Cases where it's impossible to balance because of the total number of '?' being insufficient.

In conclusion, the program is designed to fulfill all conditions laid out in the problem description, including counting, replacing, and validating the final balance of nucleotides. Thus, the program correctly implements the decoding logic as specified, ensuring the output is either a valid balanced sequence of nucleotides or indicates impossibility, thereby confirming its correctness with respect to the problem statement.
