Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it uses the formula `avg = n // 4` to calculate how many of each character ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') should ideally be present. However, this approach fails when `n` is not divisible by 4, leading to an invalid condition since each nucleotide must be present in equal quantity. 

For example, if the input is:
```
6
??G?
```
In this case, `n = 6`, and `avg = 6 // 4 = 1`. The program will compute that it needs 1 of each nucleotide, but there are only 6 characters in total. Thus, achieving an equal count of four types is impossible, and the program should output '===', which is correct, but it can miscalculate in other scenarios too.

Moreover, scenarios with combinations of existing nucleotides and '?' where the replacement leads to surplus or deficit nucleotides can cause issues, such as:
```
8
AA??CC??
```
The existing 'A's and 'C's already overshoot the necessary average (2 for each of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'), hence decoding this correctly should lead the program to output '===' when in reality, the program might complete without error due to the miscalculation in determining counts. 

In summary, the code does not correctly handle cases where `n` is not a multiple of 4 or when existing counts of nucleotides already exceed the average needed, resulting in incorrect output.
