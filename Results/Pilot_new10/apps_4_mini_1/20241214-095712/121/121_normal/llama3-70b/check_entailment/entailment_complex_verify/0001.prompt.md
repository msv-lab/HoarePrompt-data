You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we can analyze the logic of the program and see if it accounts for all potential cases outlined in the problem.

1. The program starts by reading the integer `n`, which should be the length of the genome string `s`.
2. It initializes a count dictionary to track the occurrences of nucleotides ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T').
3. It counts the occurrences of each recognized nucleotide in the string and then calculates the desired average occurrence of each nucleotide by dividing `n` by 4.
4. The program then determines how many of each nucleotide are needed to achieve this average.
5. It constructs the output by replacing the '?' characters with the required nucleotides.
6. Finally, it checks if all the requirements have been satisfied, printing the result or "===" if it's impossible.

However, upon analyzing the implementation, we can identify a problem with the logic when replacing '?' characters. Let's consider some specific cases:

- **Case 1:** If `n = 4` and the string `s = "AA??"`, the expected output is "===" because we can't have equal counts of nucleotides in this case (it requires an additional 'A' to be represented, leaving no room for 'C', 'G', or 'T').
- **Case 2:** If `n = 6` and the string `s = "??G???"` (or any other configuration of two '?' before and after 'G'). The expected output is "===" because no matter how we replace '?' characters, we cannot achieve equal nucleotides ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') since we have 'G' already and it needs three more nucleotides of any type.

In both of these examples, the program would incorrectly conclude that there is a valid solution because it simply fills in the '?' without properly verifying if the resulting counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' can ever be equal for the given length.

Since the program fails to handle cases where the existing nucleotide counts make it impossible to equalize them, the program does not satisfy the requirement for every potential input as specified in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` is {'A': the number of 'A's in `s`, 'C': the number of 'C's in `s`, 'G': the number of 'G's in `s`, 'T': the number of 'T's in `s'}. If `s` consists only of '?', then `count` remains {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}.
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `count` is updated as `count['A']` = `avg - count['A']`, `count['C']` = `avg - count['C']`, `count['G']` = `avg - count['G']`, `count['T']` = `avg - count['T']`, where `avg` is `n // 4`, and `c` has taken all values in the sequence 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'.
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `res` is a string containing all non-'?' characters from `s` along with characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' added in the order based on their presence in `count` where `count` maintains non-negative values for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', reflecting the remaining occurrences after processing all '?' characters in `s`. If no '?' exists in `s`, `res` will be exactly `s`, while if `count` for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' is exhausted, those characters will not appear in `res`.
    if any(count.values()) :
        print('===')
    else :
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; if there is at least one non-zero value in `count`, `res` contains all non-'?' characters from `s` along with characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' added in the order based on their presence in `count`, reflecting the remaining occurrences after processing all '?' characters in `s`. If all values for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `count` are zero, then `res` consists solely of the non-'?' characters from `s` which are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 4 ≤ n ≤ 255) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting solely of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It counts the occurrences of each character and calculates the average number of 'A's, 'C's, 'G's, and 'T's that should ideally be present for balance. The function then replaces the '?' characters in `s` with the required characters ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') to achieve this balance, in the order they are needed. If it is not possible to replace all '?' characters while satisfying the required counts, the function prints '===', otherwise, it prints the modified string `res`. Edge cases include handling scenarios where all characters in `s` are '?' or when the input string already has a balanced number of 'A's, 'C's, 'G's, and 'T's.
