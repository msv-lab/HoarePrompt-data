The value of `s` is assigned the value obtained from `input()`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is still the same input integer with the constraint 4 ≤ n ≤ 255. The output state must reflect that `s` has been updated with the input string while retaining the precondition regarding `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255; `s` is the input string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.**
