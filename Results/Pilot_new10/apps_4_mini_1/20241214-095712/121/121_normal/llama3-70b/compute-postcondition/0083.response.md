Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `res` is a string containing up to the first `count` number of characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' based on their occurrences in `s`, and `count` is now all values decremented by the number of times corresponding characters in `res` are included. If any character in 'ACGT' has a count greater than 0, it could potentially be included in `res`.**
