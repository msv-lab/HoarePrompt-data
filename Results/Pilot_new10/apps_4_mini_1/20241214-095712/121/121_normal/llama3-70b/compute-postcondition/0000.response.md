The value of `n` is assigned an input integer, while `s` remains unchanged. The variable `n` can take any integer value within the range of 4 to 255. The variable `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'**.
