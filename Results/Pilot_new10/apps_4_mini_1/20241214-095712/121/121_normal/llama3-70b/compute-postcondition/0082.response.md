Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `c` is 'A'; `nc` is 'G'. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `count[nc]` is decremented by 1 and `res` is incremented by 'G', followed by breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count[nc]` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count[nc]` or `res`.***
