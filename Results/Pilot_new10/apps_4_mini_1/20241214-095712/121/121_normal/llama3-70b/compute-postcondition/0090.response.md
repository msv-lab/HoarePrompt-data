Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `res` is a string containing all non-'?' characters from `s` along with characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' added in the order based on their presence in `count`, where `count` maintains non-negative values for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; and all values in `count` for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are zero, meaning no characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' can be added to `res` and `res` will only consist of the non-'?' characters from `s`.***
