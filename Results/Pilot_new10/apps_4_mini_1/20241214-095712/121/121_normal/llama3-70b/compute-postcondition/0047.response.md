Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1`, `count` is initialized based on the processing logic, `res` is set based on the nth character, `nc` can take the values 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' per iteration, and the current value of `count[nc]` is greater than 0.***
