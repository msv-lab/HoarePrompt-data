The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n-1`; `count[nc]` is a value greater than or equal to -1; `res` is the prior value of `res` concatenated with `nc`; `nc` is the next character to be processed from 'ACGT' and `count[nc]` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
