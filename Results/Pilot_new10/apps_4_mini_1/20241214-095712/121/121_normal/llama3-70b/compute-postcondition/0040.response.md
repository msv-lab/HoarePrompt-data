Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and if `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `res` is updated by adding `nc`, `count[nc]` is decremented by 1, and processing breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count[nc]` is not greater than 0, no changes occur to `res` and `count[nc]`.***
