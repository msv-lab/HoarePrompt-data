Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. If the first character `c` of `s` is '?', then `res` is a string comprised of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' added in the order of their presence in `count` until none remain. If `count` for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' is zero, `res` remains an empty string. Otherwise, if `c` is not '?', then `count` is updated so that `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` represent the number of each character left after the required updates, and `res` is set to the value of `c`.***
