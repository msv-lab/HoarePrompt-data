Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n-1`; `count[nc]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, `res` is incremented by the value of `nc` and `count[nc]` is decreased by 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
