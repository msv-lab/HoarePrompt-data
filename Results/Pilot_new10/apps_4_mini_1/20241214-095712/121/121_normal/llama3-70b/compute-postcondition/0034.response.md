The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for those variables, but we acknowledge the break in execution flow.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `res` is the updated value after the last character processed plus `nc`; `count[nc]` is decremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
