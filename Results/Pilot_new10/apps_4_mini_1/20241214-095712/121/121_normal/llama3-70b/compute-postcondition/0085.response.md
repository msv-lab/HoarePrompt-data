The value of `res` is updated by appending `c` to it. The other variables (`n`, `s`, and `c`) remain unaffected. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of that length, and `c` is a valid character not equal to '?'. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `c` is the next character in the string `s` and `res` is updated to include `c`.**
