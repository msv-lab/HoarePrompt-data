The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `res` is updated by adding `nc`, `count[nc]` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
