Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully comply with the problem description, especially with respect to handling scenarios that involve unrecognized nucleotides ('?'). Hereâ€™s a critical examination of its flaws:

1. **Count Check for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T':** 
   - The program correctly checks if each nucleotide already exceeds the target count (which is `n / 4`). If any nucleotide's count exceeds this limit, it prints '==='.
   - However, this implementation does not consider the case where the remaining question marks ('?') could potentially balance the count of the nucleotides. For example, if there are three 'A's and two '?', the program would independently print '===' just because the count of 'A's is higher than the target (which is permissible if there are sufficient '?' to fill the gap).

2. **Handling Leftover '?':**
   - After replacing '?' characters with nucleotides to balance the counts, if any '?' are still left, they remain unchanged. According to the problem description, the function should either completely decode the genome or return '===' if decoding is not possible. The program does not adequately consider if leftover '?' could result in an unanswerable situation.

3. **Output Requirements:**
   - According to the problem, if decoding is impossible, the function must output '===', which is handled correctly. However, the function still allows for the possibility of not returning any meaningful result if '?' cannot lead to an equal count, and this consideration isn't explicitly shown in the program.

4. **Example Mismatch:**
   - In the example given in the problem with `s = "????G?"`, there are not enough characters to form equal counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' despite having enough '?' to replace them. The program will fail since it may fill some '?' but won't even check if the remaining '?' can be used to balance the counts correctly.

Due to these critical flaws in logic, the program may not correctly decode certain inputs, leading to erroneous outputs or situations where it fails to print valid data. Therefore, it does not accurately fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Thus, the overall conclusion is that the program is incorrect in its implementation.
