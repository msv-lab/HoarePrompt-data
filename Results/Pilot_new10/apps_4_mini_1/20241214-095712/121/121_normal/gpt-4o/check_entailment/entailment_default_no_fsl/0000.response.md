Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where there are still '?' remaining after processing. According to the problem description, if it is not possible to decode the genome such that the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are all equal, the output should be "===".

For example, if the input is:
```
8
A??C?T?? 
```
The output should be `===` because after replacing the '?' the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' cannot be equal (the best we could do is have 3 of some and 1 of others).

The program currently replaces '?' with the first character it can use but fails to check if there are still '?' remaining after it has attempted to balance the counts. Thus, it might print a valid string when it should return "===" instead.

This issue means that the program does not conform to the problem description for all potential cases, leading to the incorrectness of the solution.
