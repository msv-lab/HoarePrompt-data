Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n` (the length of the genome) and `s` (the genome string), ensuring that `n` matches the constraints given (4 ≤ n ≤ 255).

2. **Checking Validity**: The first conditional check (`if (n % 4 != 0)`) correctly identifies if `n` is not a multiple of 4. If it is not, the program outputs "===" as required, since it would be impossible to equalize the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

3. **Counting Nucleotides**: The program initializes a count for each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') and counts how many times each nucleotide appears in the string `s`. This is necessary to understand the current balance of nucleotides before attempting to fill in the unrecognized ones.

4. **Checking Excess Counts**: The second loop checks if any nucleotide count exceeds the target count (`target_count`). If it does, the program outputs "===" indicating that it is impossible to balance the nucleotides, as the excess cannot be compensated by replacing '?'. 

5. **Filling Unrecognized Nucleotides**: The program iterates through the genome string and for each '?', it replaces it with the appropriate nucleotide if that nucleotide's count is still below the `target_count`. This ensures that every replacement helps achieve the goal of balancing the counts.

6. **Final Output**: The program constructs the final result string and prints it out. The output guarantees that the nucleotides are balanced as per the specifications, as it always fills in the '?' with the correct nucleotides based on the counts.

The program correctly covers all the cases presented in the problem description and handles edge cases such as when it's impossible to balance the genome. Therefore, it is determined to be correct in accordance with the problem requirements.
