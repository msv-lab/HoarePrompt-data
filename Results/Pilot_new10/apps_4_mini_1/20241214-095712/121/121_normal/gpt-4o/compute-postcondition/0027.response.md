Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `s` is equal to `data[1]`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` must contain keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'; and for all characters `char` in {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'}, the counts[char] is unchanged; the output printed is '==='**
