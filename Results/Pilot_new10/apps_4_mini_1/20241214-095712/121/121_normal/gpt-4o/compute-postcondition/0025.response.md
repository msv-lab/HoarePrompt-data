Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string, `s` is equal to `data[1]`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` must contain keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' representing counts of those characters, and for all characters `char` in {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'}, the counts[char] is less than or equal to `target_count`.***
