Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with each count equal to `target_count`, and all counts are equal to `target_count` at the end. `result` is a list where all characters at the indices from 0 to the last used index are represented by the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' according to the counts, and `i` is equal to the number of characters filled in the `result` list.**
