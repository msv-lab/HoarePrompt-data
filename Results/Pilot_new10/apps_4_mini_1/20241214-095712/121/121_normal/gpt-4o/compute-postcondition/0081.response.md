Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` must have keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with at least one count greater than `target_count`; if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result[0]` is assigned the value of `char`, `i` remains 0, and the count of `char` in `counts` is incremented by 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
