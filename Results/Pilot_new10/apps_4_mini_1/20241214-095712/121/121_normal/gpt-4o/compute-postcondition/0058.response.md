Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', each currently equal to `target_count`; `char` will take each key in `counts` during the loop; the current value of `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`.***
