Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and if the count for `char` is less than `target_count`, then the count for `char` is increased by 1 and remains less than or equal to `target_count + 1`, `result` is a list where `result[0]` is `char`, and `i` is 0, with `char` representing one of the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' in counts.***
