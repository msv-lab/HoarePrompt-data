The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` must satisfy the constraints of being between 4 and 255, inclusive. The string `s` must have a length equal to `n` and contain only the characters from the set {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', '?'}.

After executing the function, based on the provided output, the function can exhibit several behaviors: 

- In Case 1, the function returns without any value, indicating an empty return statement.
- In Case 2, the function explicitly returns `None` because there's no specified value provided to return.
- In Case 3, the function reaches the end of its execution without a return value, meaning it produces no output and also prints '==='.
- In Case 4, similar to Case 1, the function returns nothing due to the empty return statement.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s` while having various return behaviors that may include returning nothing, returning `None`, or ending without a return value while printing '==='.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer between 4 and 255) and `s` (a string of length `n` containing specific characters), and can return nothing, return `None`, or display '===' while reaching the end of execution.**
