Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `s` is equal to `data[1]`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}; `char` will iterate over `s` from the first character; the current value of `char` is one of the keys in `counts` (i.e., `char` is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T').***
