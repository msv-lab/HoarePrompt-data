The code `print('===')` outputs a string of three equal signs and does not modify any variables in the initial state. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters from the set {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', '?'}; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string into separate elements based on whitespace; `s` is equal to `data[1]`; and the current value of `n` is such that `n` modulo 4 is not equal to 0.**
