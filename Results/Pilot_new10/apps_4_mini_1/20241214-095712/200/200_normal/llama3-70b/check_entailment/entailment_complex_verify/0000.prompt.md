You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if it adheres to the problem description and handles all edge cases.

The problem states that given `n` kegs with specific volumes, the goal is to pour `s` liters of kvass while maximizing the remaining volume in the least filled keg. The output should be the volume left in the least filled keg after pouring `s` liters of kvass, or `-1` if it's not possible to pour `s` liters.

Let's analyze the provided program step by step:

1. **Input Handling:** It correctly reads the number of kegs `n`, the amount of kvass `s`, and the list of volumes `v`.
   
2. **Sorting:** The list of volumes is sorted, which is helpful for deciding how to pour kvass while keeping track of the least keg.

3. **Binary Search:** The program uses binary search to find the maximum possible value `low` such that if we keep all kegs above this level, we can still pour `s` liters:
   - `total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))` calculates the total kvass that can be poured when the minimum keg value is `mid`.
   - The binary search updates `low` and `high` based on whether the total kvass is sufficient.

4. **Final Check:** After the binary search loop, the program checks if the total kvass possible at the level of `low` is equal to `s`; if not, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs `low`.

### Potential Issues

While the binary search logic seems sound for finding the maximum possible minimum remaining keg volume, there are issues:

- **Incorrect Updating of `low`:** The line `if total < s:` causes `low` to be updated incorrectly. Instead, it should update `high` if `total < s` to decrease the volume we are considering because there isn't enough kvass available. 

### Counter Example
To illustrate the problem with an input example:

Let's consider:
```
Input:
3 6
1 1 10
```

The program's logic would sort the volumes to `[1, 1, 10]` and enter the binary search loop:
- If `mid` is chosen (let's say, `1`), `total` will be `min(1, 1) + min(1, 1) + min(1, 10) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which is less than `6`. Thus, it incorrectly shifts `low` up.
- It continues this until it can't find a way to accumulate 6 liters, but by the end, `low` doesn't hold the correct value to determine that it couldn't pour 6 liters, since it will output a keg volume that doesn't represent the least keg.

Thus, in this scenario, the program can produce an incorrect output for cases where it is impossible to pour `s` liters.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), s is a positive integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), and v is a list of n positive integers (1 <= v[i] <= 10^9) representing the volume of kvass in each keg.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, and both are less than the initial value of `min(v)`, while the final `total` value is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v`, which does not exceed `s`.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`low` is equal to `high`, and both are less than the initial value of `min(v)`. If the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element `x` in `v` is not equal to `s`, the output will be -1. Otherwise, the printed output will be the current value of `low`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `s`, and a list `v` of `n` positive integers. It determines the largest volume that can be uniformly distributed among the kegs such that the total volume does not exceed `s`. If the exact total of `s` cannot be achieved with the kegs' volumes, it returns -1. If achieved, it returns the maximum possible volume `low` that still meets this constraint.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
