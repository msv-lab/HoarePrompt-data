Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `s`, and a list `v` of `n` positive integers. It determines the largest volume that can be uniformly distributed among the kegs such that the total volume does not exceed `s`. If the exact total of `s` cannot be achieved with the kegs' volumes, it returns -1. If achieved, it returns the maximum possible volume `low` that still meets this constraint. **
