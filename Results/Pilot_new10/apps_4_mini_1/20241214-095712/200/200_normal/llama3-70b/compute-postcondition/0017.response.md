Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, and `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `high` is set to `(low + high + 1) // 2 - 1`.***
