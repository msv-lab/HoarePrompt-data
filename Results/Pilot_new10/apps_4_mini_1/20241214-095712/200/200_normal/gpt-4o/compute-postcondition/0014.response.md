The variable `remaining_kvass` decreases by the value of `possible_to_take`. The value of `possible_to_take` is defined as `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`. Therefore, after executing the statement, `remaining_kvass` will be equal to its previous value minus the computed value of `possible_to_take`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `possible_to_take`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0, `possible_to_take` is equal to `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass), remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`.**
