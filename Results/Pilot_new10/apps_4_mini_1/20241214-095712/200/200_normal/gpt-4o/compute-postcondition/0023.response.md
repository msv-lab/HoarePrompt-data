Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, and `i` is 1. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, no variables change. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is calculated as the minimum of `volumes[1] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`, and `remaining_kvass` is updated to `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take`.***
