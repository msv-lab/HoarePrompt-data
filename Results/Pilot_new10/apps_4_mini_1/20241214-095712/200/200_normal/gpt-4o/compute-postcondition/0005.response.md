The code `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1` but does not change any variables or the state of the program; it simply prints a value to the console. Therefore, all the previous state information remains intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is set to the input value (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer that is set to the input value (1 <= s <= 10^12), `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list, and the current value of `total_volume` is less than `s`. The output is -1.**
