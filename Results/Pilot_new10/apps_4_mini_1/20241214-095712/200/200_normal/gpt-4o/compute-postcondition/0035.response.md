The operation `min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` reduces the value of `min_keg_volume` by the result of the integer division of `(remaining_kvass + n - 1)` by `n`. 

Given that:
- `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000,
- `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0,
- The expression `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` will always be a positive integer since `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, and `n` is at least 1.

The final value of `min_keg_volume` will be updated but is not specifically provided in the initial state. The other variables (`n`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to the count of valid `volumes` processed before `remaining_kvass` became 0 or all iterations complete, and `min_keg_volume` is updated by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` from its previous value.**
