According to the code, the `for` loop iterates from `0` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increase by 1. Therefore, after this iteration, `i` will be 2. 

Additionally, since `n` has to be greater than `i` for the loop to continue executing, we also need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 (n must be greater than 2). 

State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
