The variable `remaining_kvass` is decremented by `possible_to_take`. The value of `possible_to_take` is calculated as `min(volumes[2] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`. Since `remaining_kvass` is reduced by this value, the exact new value of `remaining_kvass` can be expressed as its previous value minus `possible_to_take`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `i` also remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 2, and `remaining_kvass` is updated to `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 2, `remaining_kvass` is updated to `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take`.**
