Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000. If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is updated by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` from its previous value, and `i` is equal to the count of valid `volumes` processed before `remaining_kvass` becomes 0 or all iterations complete.***
