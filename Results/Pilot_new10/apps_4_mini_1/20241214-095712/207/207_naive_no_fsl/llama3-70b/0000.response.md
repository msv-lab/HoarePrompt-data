The program provided aims to calculate the sum of `f(i)` values for `i` from `0` to `m`, where `f(i)` represents the number of distinct integers that the frog can reach starting from position `0` with the ability to jump `+a` and `-b`.

Let's analyze the code:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes `dp` with size `m + 1`, which will hold sums for how many ways the frog can reach each index from `0` to `m`.
2. **Starting position**: The base case `dp[0] = 1` indicates that the frog starts at position `0`.
3. **Loop through each position**: The outer loop iterates through each position `i` from `0` to `m`.
4. **Forward jump**: If `i + a` is within bounds, it increments `dp[i + a]` by the value at `dp[i]`, indicating the frog can reach `i + a` from `i`.
5. **Backward jump**: If `i - b` is non-negative, it increments `dp[i]` by the value at `dp[i - b]`, indicating the frog can also reach `i` back from `i - b`. This logic seems incorrect, as it does not maintain the correct count of reachable positions.

The key concern arises from the backward jump condition. This logic is flawed because it will incorrectly double count the reachable indices it jumps back to. Each index reached should only be counted distinctly without accumulating reachable amounts on backward jumps, which doesn't logically correspond to the problem description.

### Example of failure:
Consider the input:
```
m = 4
a = 2
b = 1
```
- Valid reachable integers are:
  - `f(0) = 1` (can only reach `0`)
  - `f(1) = 1` (can only reach `0`)
  - `f(2) = 2` (can reach `0` and `2`)
  - `f(3) = 2` (can reach `0`, `2`)
  - `f(4) = 3` (can reach `0`, `2`, `4`)
  
The function should yield `f(0) + f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 9`.

However, the program will fail to return the correct count due to the faulty accumulation in the dp calculation, leading to the summing of distinct positions improperly.

Given this flawed logic and potential failing case, the overall correctness is affected.

Thus, the decision is:

Correctness: **False**
