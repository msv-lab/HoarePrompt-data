To determine the correctness of the given Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and verify its adherence to the requirements.

### Program Analysis
The goal is to calculate `f(x)` which is the number of distinct integers reachable by the frog from position 0 to position `x` using two types of jumps governed by `a` and `b`. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and the main logic is handled by `func_2`.

1. **Handling GCD**: The program reduces `a` and `b` by their GCD, which is appropriate since the reachable positions will be repeating cycles determined by the ratio of `a` and `b`.

2. **Mathematical Summation**: 
   - When `m` is less than `a + b - 1`, the sum of integers from `0` to `m` is calculated directly. 
   - When `m` is greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, the program calculates the overall distinct positions reachable for that range using derived summation techniques.

### Potential Edge Cases
However, we need to check if the program correctly handles all edge cases. One potential edge case is closely analyzing when `m` is less than `a + b - 1`.

For instance, if:
- `m = 1`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`
Here, possible reachable positions are `0` and `1`, resulting in values of `f(0) = 1` and `f(1) = 1`. So the expected output should render 2 when summed up:
```
Expected output: f(0) + f(1) = 2
```

In another situation:
- `m = 4`, `a = 2`, `b = 2` should lead to checking positions up to `4`, where the reachable values might be limited, hence requiring careful accounting not to miss any summation.

### Observations
Upon this analysis, I noticed that there are cases where the GCD could alter the outcome beyond the simplistically calculated ranges, causing discrepancies when `m` is relatively small or counter to the expected outcomes based on `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion
Taking the above edge cases into account, they suggest limitations in the original program. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**

### Example Failure Case
For `m = 3`, `a = 3`, and `b = 1`, the reachable numbers are `0, 1, 2, 3`. However, the expected logic needs to correctly account for reachable range under the constraints established, which the program might inadvertently miscalculate.
