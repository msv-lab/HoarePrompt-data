You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and verify its adherence to the requirements.

### Program Analysis
The goal is to calculate `f(x)` which is the number of distinct integers reachable by the frog from position 0 to position `x` using two types of jumps governed by `a` and `b`. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and the main logic is handled by `func_2`.

1. **Handling GCD**: The program reduces `a` and `b` by their GCD, which is appropriate since the reachable positions will be repeating cycles determined by the ratio of `a` and `b`.

2. **Mathematical Summation**: 
   - When `m` is less than `a + b - 1`, the sum of integers from `0` to `m` is calculated directly. 
   - When `m` is greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, the program calculates the overall distinct positions reachable for that range using derived summation techniques.

### Potential Edge Cases
However, we need to check if the program correctly handles all edge cases. One potential edge case is closely analyzing when `m` is less than `a + b - 1`.

For instance, if:
- `m = 1`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`
Here, possible reachable positions are `0` and `1`, resulting in values of `f(0) = 1` and `f(1) = 1`. So the expected output should render 2 when summed up:
```
Expected output: f(0) + f(1) = 2
```

In another situation:
- `m = 4`, `a = 2`, `b = 2` should lead to checking positions up to `4`, where the reachable values might be limited, hence requiring careful accounting not to miss any summation.

### Observations
Upon this analysis, I noticed that there are cases where the GCD could alter the outcome beyond the simplistically calculated ranges, causing discrepancies when `m` is relatively small or counter to the expected outcomes based on `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion
Taking the above edge cases into account, they suggest limitations in the original program. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**

### Example Failure Case
For `m = 3`, `a = 3`, and `b = 1`, the reachable numbers are `0, 1, 2, 3`. However, the expected logic needs to correctly account for reachable range under the constraints established, which the program might inadvertently miscalculate.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0 at the start, the function will directly return `x` as the GCD, since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts three parameters: positive integers `m`, `a`, and `b`. It first calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to obtain `g`. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with modified parameters `(m // g, a // g, b // g)`, multiplying the result by `g`. If `m` is less than `k` (where `k` is `a + b - 1`), it returns the sum of the first `m + 1` integers. If neither of these conditions hold, it calculates and returns the sum of two series: one up to `k` and another from `k` to `m`. The function can therefore handle different scenarios based on the values of `g`, `m`, `a`, and `b` while involving multiple recursive calls if `g` is greater than 1. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
