To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's break down the logic in `func_2` and how it aligns with the problem requirements.

The problem states that a frog can jump either forwards by `a` units or backwards by `b` units, and it starts at position 0 on a number line. The main goal is to compute `f(x)`, the number of distinct integers that the frog can reach within the range `0` to `x`, and then find the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.

### Functionality Breakdown:
- **Function `func_1(x, y)`**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. It is not directly related to computing `f(x)`, but is used for simplifying the parameters `a` and `b` in `func_2`.

- **In `func_2(m, a, b)`**:
  - The GCD of `a` and `b` is calculated with `g = func_1(a, b)`.
  - If `g` is not equal to 1, the function recursively processes the values by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by `g`.
  - A threshold check is done with `k = a + b - 1`. If `m < k`, it simply returns the sum of the first `m + 1` integers.
  - If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of two separate series up to `k` and from `k` to `m`.

### Analysis of Potential Edge Cases:
1. **When `m < k`**: In this case, the function behaves as expected by summing the first `m + 1` integers. It correctly counts all reachable integers from 0 to `m`.
   
2. **When `m >= k`**: The function should correctly compute the sum of the first series (`sum_k`) and that from `k` to `m`. The way the sum is computed is:
   - `sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2` gives the sum of numbers from `0` to `k`.
   - The second term computes the sum of numbers from `k` to `m`, ensuring continuity.

3. **Recursive Case of GCD**: The function simplifies the problem using the GCD, ensuring that the jumps size `a` and `b` are adjusted accordingly. However, with each recursive call, care must be taken to ensure any computed reachable numbers are valid.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles the cases as per the specifications stated in the problem. The handling of different ranges of `m`, the use of GCD for simplification, and the summation across distinct reachable integers seems solid and adheres to the rational behavior expected from the frog's jumping ability.

Considering that the provided examples match the explanations given in the code logic and there are no detectable edge cases in the description where the function fails, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**.
