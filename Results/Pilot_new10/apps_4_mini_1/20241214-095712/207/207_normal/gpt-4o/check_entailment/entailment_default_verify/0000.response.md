Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The program correctly implements the logic needed to compute the number of distinct integers the frog can reach on the number line based on the jumping conditions described in the problem. It efficiently utilizes the GCD to address cases where `a` and `b` share common factors, thereby scaling down the problem without losing generality.

The provided output hints clarify that both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are designed to handle the requirements as specified in the problem description. The explanation of `func_1` correctly describes its role in calculating the GCD, ensuring that the subsequent calculations in `func_2` are valid and meaningful.

Additionally, the logic in `func_2` for handling different ranges based on the value of `m` relative to `a + b - 1` captures the necessary conditions to calculate `f(i)` effectively for all integers from `0` to `m`. The adjustments and calculations within the function were analyzed to be consistent with the aforementioned logic, allowing for a correct summation irrespective of the specific values of `m`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, upon comprehensive evaluation of the program against the problem requirements, as well as a review of the output hints, the final conclusion remains that the program is indeed correct.
