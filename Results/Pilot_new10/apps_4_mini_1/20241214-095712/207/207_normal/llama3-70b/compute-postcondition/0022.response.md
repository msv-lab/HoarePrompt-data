The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it utilizes parameters that are defined to have specific constraints: `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). 

The return value is not specified in the provided output, so we cannot identify specific return cases or their values. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but relies on external positive integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b` within specific ranges. The output of the function is undefined based on the given information.**
