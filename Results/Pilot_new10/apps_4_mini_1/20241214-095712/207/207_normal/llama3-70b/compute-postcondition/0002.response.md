`dp[0]` is assigned the value `1`. The length of the list `dp` is `m + 1`, and all other values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated information retains the conditions for `m`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer specified by input (1 <= `m` <= 10^9); `a` is a positive integer specified by input (1 <= `a` <= 10^5); `b` is a positive integer specified by input (1 <= `b` <= 10^5); `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`, with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other values initialized to 0.**
