The operation `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` will update the value of `dp[i + a]` by adding the current value of `dp[i]` to it. 

Given that initially:
- `dp[0]` is `1`, which represents one way to reach `0`,
- `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` are all initialized to `0`, and
- `i` starts at `0` and `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`,

The operation will result in:
- `dp[i + a]` becomes `dp[i + a] + dp[0]`, which simplifies to just `dp[a]` since `dp[0]` is `1`.

Thus, we can conclude that the state of the `dp` array has changed specifically at position `a`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `a` is a positive integer (1 <= `a` <= 10^5), `b` is a positive integer (1 <= `b` <= 10^5), `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` are all initialized to 0, `i` is 0, and `dp[a]` is 1.**
