The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all initialized to `0`. The value of `m` is a positive integer specified by input, and it is within the range 1 to 10^9. Consequently, the length of the `dp` list will be equal to `m + 1`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer specified by input (1 <= `m` <= 10^9); `a` is a positive integer specified by input (1 <= `a` <= 10^5); `b` is a positive integer specified by input (1 <= `b` <= 10^5); `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`, all initialized to 0.**
