The expression `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` indicates that we are updating a value at the index `i + a` in the list `dp` by adding the value at index `i`. Given that `m`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, and `i` is specified as the last iteration incremented by 1, we can determine that:

- The variable `i` holds the value of the previous iteration plus 1.
- The index `i + a` in the `dp` list will be updated by adding the current value of `dp[i]`.

Since `m` is a positive integer, itâ€™s indicated that `dp` has a sufficient size to accommodate the access at index `i + a`.

Output State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `i` is the value of the last iteration incremented by 1, and `dp[i + a]` is updated to `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`.**
