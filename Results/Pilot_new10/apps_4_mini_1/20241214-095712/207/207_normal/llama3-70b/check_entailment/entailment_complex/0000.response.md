Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for computing the function \( f(x) \). 

Here's why:

1. The task is to compute the number of distinct integers the frog can reach, denoted as \( f(x) \), for each integer \( x \) from \( 0 \) to \( m \), and then sum these values. The expected output is the sum of all reachable integers from \( 0 \) to \( m \).

2. The program defines a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` is counted as the number of ways to reach position \( i \) from \( 0 \). However, this is not equivalent to counting distinct integers that can be reached, which is what \( f(x) \) represents.

3. The logic of updating `dp[i]` by summing counts from `dp[i - b]` does not reflect the distinct integers which can be obtained by the frog's movement capabilities. Instead, `dp[i]` would end up representing the count of ways to arrive at position \( i \), rather than confirming the integers are reachable.

4. Specifically, it doesn't account for how each position can be directly derived from \( k + a \) and \( k - b \). When the frog jumps backward or forward, the number of reachable integers is calculated instead of explicitly determining the set of distinct integers.

5. Moreover, for larger \( m \) values, the program may not work efficiently, or the logic might result in incorrect calculations.

In summary, the program does not accurately capture the requirement of summing distinct integers reachable by the frog, based on the constraints of jumping by \( a \) forward or \( b \) backward. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem description requirements.
