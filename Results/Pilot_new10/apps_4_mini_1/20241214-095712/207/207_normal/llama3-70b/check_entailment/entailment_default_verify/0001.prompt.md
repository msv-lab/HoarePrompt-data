You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))


```
Original Assessment: The program provided aims to calculate the sum of `f(i)` values for `i` from `0` to `m`, where `f(i)` represents the number of distinct integers that the frog can reach starting from position `0` with the ability to jump `+a` and `-b`.

Let's analyze the code:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes `dp` with size `m + 1`, which will hold sums for how many ways the frog can reach each index from `0` to `m`.
2. **Starting position**: The base case `dp[0] = 1` indicates that the frog starts at position `0`.
3. **Loop through each position**: The outer loop iterates through each position `i` from `0` to `m`.
4. **Forward jump**: If `i + a` is within bounds, it increments `dp[i + a]` by the value at `dp[i]`, indicating the frog can reach `i + a` from `i`.
5. **Backward jump**: If `i - b` is non-negative, it increments `dp[i]` by the value at `dp[i - b]`, indicating the frog can also reach `i` back from `i - b`. This logic seems incorrect, as it does not maintain the correct count of reachable positions.

The key concern arises from the backward jump condition. This logic is flawed because it will incorrectly double count the reachable indices it jumps back to. Each index reached should only be counted distinctly without accumulating reachable amounts on backward jumps, which doesn't logically correspond to the problem description.

### Example of failure:
Consider the input:
```
m = 4
a = 2
b = 1
```
- Valid reachable integers are:
  - `f(0) = 1` (can only reach `0`)
  - `f(1) = 1` (can only reach `0`)
  - `f(2) = 2` (can reach `0` and `2`)
  - `f(3) = 2` (can reach `0`, `2`)
  - `f(4) = 3` (can reach `0`, `2`, `4`)
  
The function should yield `f(0) + f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 9`.

However, the program will fail to return the correct count due to the faulty accumulation in the dp calculation, leading to the summing of distinct positions improperly.

Given this flawed logic and potential failing case, the overall correctness is affected.

Thus, the decision is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts three positive integers `m`, `a`, and `b` through user input and calculates the total number of ways to reach the index `m` using steps of size `a` (forward) and `b` (backward). It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each index from 0 to `m`. Ultimately, it prints the sum of all ways to reach each index, including those that might not be reachable with the specified `a` and `b`. If `m` is too large or `a` and `b` are outside the defined ranges, the function may not behave correctly, but this is dependent on the input constraints. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
