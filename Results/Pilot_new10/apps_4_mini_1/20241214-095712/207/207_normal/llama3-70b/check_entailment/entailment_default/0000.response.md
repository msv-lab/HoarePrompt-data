The provided program attempts to compute the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line based on the given jumps. However, the implementation logic is flawed.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. The `dp` array is initialized to zero and only `dp[0]` is set to 1, which indicates that the frog can initially be at position 0.
2. The loop iterates over every position `i` from 0 to `m`.
   - If the frog can jump forward by `a`, it increments `dp[i + a]` by the number of ways to reach `i` (stored in `dp[i]`).
   - If the frog can jump backward by `b`, it incorrectly increments `dp[i]` by the number of ways to reach `i - b` which doesn't make logical sense in the context of counting reachable positions. The frog shouldn't be storing reachable counts in `dp[i]` when it makes a backward jump.
3. The situation is compounded by the fact that there is a lack of conditions to handle out-of-bounds scenarios adequately.

### Output Hints:

The hints indicate that the function is meant to count the total number of ways to reach the index `m`, but it mistakenly suggests that the backward jump should add to the current position, which doesn't align with the problem description.

### Counterexamples:

- If we take input values `m=1`, `a=1`, and `b=2`:
    - It suggests `dp[1]` would be incremented by `dp[0]`, but since there's a backward jump that can't lead to positive indices from position 1, it may lead to wrong calculations in the count of distinct reachable integers.
  
- When `m` is significantly larger than both `a` and `b` (like `m=10^9, a=1, b=1`), the program logic implies that there could be loops or even runtime failures since it will attempt to iterate over a vast range without careful constraint handling.

### Conclusion:

The function does not correctly compute the number of distinct integers the frog can reach according to the defined rules; it fails for a variety of cases, especially as it relies on incorrect updating strategies in the `dp` structure.

Correctness: **False**.
